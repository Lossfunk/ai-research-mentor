Here’s a concise, venue-agnostic final submission checklist tailored for a privacy-preserving NLP paper, with artifact requirements, ethics statements, and a six-week countdown. I reference established checklists (ACL Responsible NLP and Ethics, NeurIPS paper checklist) where appropriate [1][2][5].

Six-week countdown timeline (deadline in 6 weeks)
- Week 6: Scope lock and gap analysis
  - Lock threat model (attacker capabilities, data access, goals), formal privacy definition (e.g., (ε, δ)-DP, RDP), and target tasks/datasets.
  - Inventory all experiments; identify missing baselines (non-private SOTA, non-private ablations).
  - Align paper structure with Responsible NLP checklist topics (datasets, models, evaluation, limitations) [2].
- Week 5: Experiments complete (first pass)
  - Finish core training runs for all models and datasets; log seeds, configs, and privacy accounting.
  - Run initial privacy attacks (membership inference and extraction) and sanity checks for leakage.
  - Begin drafting ethics statement sections: data handling, consent, minimization, privacy guarantees, residual risks [1][2].
- Week 4: Reproducibility and artifacts draft
  - Freeze results for main tables; create run scripts; capture exact environment; write README with expected runtimes/hardware.
  - Package anonymized code artifacts; draft reproducibility checklist mapped to NeurIPS guidelines (inputs/outputs, stochasticity, compute, data access) [5].
- Week 3: Robustness and ablations
  - Complete ablations (noise multipliers, clipping, batch size), cross-dataset validation, and stress tests (domain shift).
  - Finalize threat-model justification and privacy accounting details in the paper; update ethics statement with evaluation of residual risks [1][2].
- Week 2: Paper polish and compliance
  - Tighten writing, figures, and tables; address Responsible NLP checklist items explicitly in appendix [2].
  - Pre-review for ethics and compliance; confirm IRB or equivalent approvals or exemptions (if applicable) [1].
  - Conduct internal dry-run of artifact reproduction from a clean machine.
- Week 1: Final checks and submission packaging
  - Regenerate all plots/tables from scripts; verify deterministic seeds or confidence intervals for nondeterminism.
  - Final ethics statement, limitations, and broader deployment considerations; cross-check with checklists [1][2][5].
  - Anonymization check; finalize artifact archive or anonymous repo; test download/build/run instructions.
- Last 48 hours: Freeze and submit
  - Freeze commit hash and upload artifact; ensure links work from a clean environment.
  - Final checklist sweep (below); convert to PDF; submit.

Paper content checklist (privacy-preserving NLP specifics)
- Problem and threat model
  - Specify adversary (black-box/white-box), goals (membership inference, attribute inference, canary extraction), and constraints.
  - State formal privacy definition and parameters used ((ε, δ), composition method, RDP order), with accountant method and assumptions.
- Methods
  - Describe privacy mechanism (e.g., DP-SGD hyperparameters, clipping, noise multiplier schedule), training pipeline, and any secure computation components.
  - Implementation details to enable replication: frameworks, versions, seeds, distributed setup, gradient accumulation.
- Datasets and preprocessing
  - Dataset provenance, licensing, consent/terms, PII handling, filtering/anonymization approaches; include a clear data statement (who/what/why/risks).
- Baselines and evaluation
  - Utility: appropriate baselines (non-private, privacy-weak baselines, prior privacy methods).
  - Privacy: attacks covering membership inference and extraction/canary tests; report metrics (AUC, precision@k, exposure).
  - Report statistical uncertainty (CIs, multiple seeds).
- Results and analysis
  - Utility-privacy trade-off (Pareto curves); sensitivity to clipping, noise, batch size; domain shift.
  - Failure modes and limitations; applicability conditions; compute and cost.
- Reproducibility disclosures
  - Hardware/compute budget, runtime, peak memory; software environment; random seeds; data access instructions; exact hyperparameters [5].

Ethics statement checklist (align to venue guidance)
- Data ethics
  - Consent or lawful basis for data use; respect terms of service and licenses.
  - PII/PHI handling: minimization, filtering/anonymization, residual risk, re-identification mitigations; red-teaming outcomes.
- Privacy guarantees and risks
  - Justify privacy definition for the threat model; report ε, δ (or RDP), composition, and accountant details in plain language.
  - Empirical leakage evidence: summarize attack evaluations and residual risks to individuals/groups; note contexts where risks remain.
- Fairness and safety
  - Assess differential impact on subgroups (utility and privacy); bias amplification risks; mitigations considered.
- Compliance and governance
  - IRB/ethics board status (approved, exempt, not human subjects) and rationale; data governance (storage, access controls, retention).
  - Downstream misuse risks and mitigations (misuse-resistant release plans, rate limits/filters, restricted weights if needed).
- Disclosure and transparency
  - What you will and won’t release (code, models, data, attack scripts); rationale for any restrictions and how researchers can request access [1][2].

Artifact and reproducibility package checklist
- Code and configuration
  - Train/eval scripts; config files (all hyperparameters); seed control; exact preprocessing.
  - Privacy-specific components (clipping, noise) clearly modularized; accountant implementation and unit tests.
- Environment
  - environment.yml or requirements.txt; Docker/Conda; tested on a clean machine.
  - OS/GPU/driver/CUDA versions; deterministic flags where possible; note sources of nondeterminism and mitigation.
- Data access
  - Download scripts; licenses; checksums; instructions for private or restricted data (application process or synthetic substitute).
  - PII-sanitized samples; instructions for canary insertion experiments without exposing real PII.
- Models and checkpoints
  - Checkpoint files with hashes; model cards summarizing training data, privacy params, limitations, and intended use.
- Reproduction script
  - Single command to reproduce main table and figures; expected runtime, hardware; target numbers with tolerances.
- Privacy evaluation suite
  - Attack code for membership inference and canary extraction; instructions and expected metrics; safe defaults to avoid leaking real PII.
- Documentation and logging
  - README with quick start, full pipeline description, runtime expectations, and troubleshooting.
  - Logs for one full successful run; compute budget summary; failure cases and known issues.
- Packaging
  - Anonymized artifact (no author names/affiliations); archive and/or anonymous repo link; verify link from a fresh environment [5].

Submission-day checklist
- Formatting and anonymization per venue; all figures/tables regenerate from scripts.
- Ethics statement present and internally consistent with the paper and artifacts [1][2].
- Responsible NLP checklist or equivalent included in appendix and cross-referenced in the text [2].
- Reproducibility details complete (compute, seeds, data access, environment) [5].
- Artifact link tested; backup mirror available; commit hash frozen.
- Final pass for claims: no unsupported statements; limitations and residual risks clearly stated.

Concrete, falsifiable experiments to include
- E1: Membership inference vs. privacy budget
  - Hypothesis: At ε ≤ 4 (δ = 1e−5), attack AUC for shadow-model membership inference falls to ≤ 0.60 on all evaluated tasks while maintaining ≥ 90% of non-private accuracy.
  - Variables: ε via noise multiplier; clipping norm; batch size; datasets (e.g., SST-2, AG News).
  - Metrics: Attack AUC, precision@k; task accuracy/F1; confidence intervals over 5 seeds.
  - Expected outcome: Lower ε reduces attack performance with a monotonic trade-off in utility.
- E2: Canary extraction in generative models
  - Hypothesis: With DP-SGD at ε ≤ 6, the maximum exposure score for canaries is ≤ 5 across prompt templates, while a non-private model shows exposure ≥ 15.
  - Variables: DP vs. non-DP; number of canaries; prompt styles; training data size.
  - Metrics: Exposure (Carlini et al.); exact-match leak rate; perplexity.
  - Expected outcome: DP reduces canary exposure substantially relative to non-DP.
- E3: Utility–privacy Pareto via clipping/noise ablations
  - Hypothesis: There exists a clipping norm c* that improves both utility and privacy at fixed ε compared to naive defaults.
  - Variables: Clipping norm grid; noise multiplier; optimizer; batch size.
  - Metrics: Task accuracy/F1; effective ε (with accountant); training stability (gradient norm stats).
  - Expected outcome: Moderate clipping reduces gradient variance and improves the Pareto frontier.
- E4: Cross-domain leakage robustness
  - Hypothesis: Models trained with DP exhibit no statistically significant increase in PII leakage when evaluated on out-of-domain prompts relative to in-domain prompts, unlike non-DP baselines.
  - Variables: Prompt domain (in-domain vs. out-of-domain); DP vs. non-DP; temperature.
  - Metrics: PII detection recall/precision (synthetic PII), exposure; bootstrapped CIs.
  - Expected outcome: DP models maintain low leakage across domains; non-DP models degrade.

Notes and gaps
- Venues differ in exact ethics and artifact policies; use the venue’s current CFP and policy pages to align final details. The above checklists align with ACL Responsible NLP and NeurIPS reproducibility guidance but should be adapted to the target venue [1][2][5].

Key takeaways
- Lock the threat model and privacy accounting early; complete core experiments by Week 5.
- Build and test a clean, anonymous artifact by Week 3–2; dry-run reproduction on a fresh machine.
- Use ethics and responsibility checklists to ensure coverage of data handling, privacy guarantees, and residual risks; explicitly report ε, δ, attacks, and limitations.
