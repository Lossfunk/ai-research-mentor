Below is a practical, venue-agnostic publishing playbook tailored to a cross-lingual dialogue paper. I assume an ACL/ARR-style workflow; adapt steps to your target venue’s exact rules.

Step 0 — Decide your provenance, licensing, and archival plan (do this first)
- Pick licenses early and keep them consistent across PDF, code, data, and models (e.g., Apache-2.0/MIT for code, CC-BY/ODC for data). State any third-party licenses and usage constraints in the paper and READMEs [2].
- Choose archival homes and DOIs now: code on GitHub + Zenodo DOI; data and models on Hugging Face with dataset/model cards; preprint on arXiv [5][6][7][4].
- If your study includes human subjects/annotators, confirm IRB or exemption, and plan the ethics statement accordingly [2].

Step 1 — Camera-ready preparation (content, formatting, and compliance)
- Resolve reviewer comments and clearly integrate changes: strengthened methods, added ablations, clarified limitations.
- Update metadata: title, authors, equal-contribution footnotes, affiliations, acknowledgments, funding, conflicts of interest.
- Ensure venue formatting: style file compliance, page limits, embedded fonts, accessible figures (alt text in captions, high-contrast colors) [11].
- Reproducibility pass:
  - Freeze code at a release tag; pin dependencies (requirements.txt/conda.yml, pip-tools) and record exact versions.
  - Provide a one-command run script for training/inference; include random seeds and deterministic flags.
  - Include hardware specs, training time, and cost; quantify compute emissions or provide a method (CodeCarbon or ML CO2 Impact calculator) [14].
  - Complete the venue’s reproducibility/responsible-research checklist (e.g., ARR Responsible NLP Research Checklist; ACL Reproducibility Checklist where applicable) [1][3].
- Prepare appendices and supplementary:
  - Add full experimental details (hyperparameters, data preprocessing, tokenization, Unicode normalization).
  - Provide error analyses across languages/dialects.
  - Include dataset documentation (provenance, collection, splits, licenses) and model details (training recipe, intended use, limitations) [6][7][8][9].
- Ethics and disclosure statements:
  - Include an ethics statement per ACL/ARR expectations (risks, annotator protections/policies, potential harms, consent, dual-use) [1][2].
  - Add a Limitations section and, if required, Broader Impact.
  - Explicitly discuss cross-lingual risks: dialect coverage, code-switching, translation artifacts, disparities in quality across languages, potential for cultural misinterpretation or toxicity amplification.
- Final checks before upload:
  - Validate references (completeness, capitalization, DOIs).
  - Check PDFs for accessible text, embedded fonts, and working hyperlinks.
  - Prepare a camera-ready change log (internal) mapping reviewer points to changes.

Step 2 — Prepare and package artifacts (code, data, models)
- Code (GitHub):
  - Structure repo with src/, scripts/, configs/, tests/, docs/. Add README with quickstart, environment setup, and training/inference commands.
  - Include LICENSE, CITATION.cff, and a clear data download script. Add results/leaderboard reproduction steps if applicable.
  - Tag a release and mint a DOI via Zenodo; put the DOI badge in README and paper [5].
- Data:
  - Host on Hugging Face Datasets (or institutional/Zenodo if sensitive). Provide a dataset card: motivation, composition, collection process, labeling, quality control, splits, preprocessing, languages and dialects, governance, and licensing [7][8].
  - Include scripts to reconstruct exact splits and any translation/normalization pipeline.
  - If third-party data included, state licenses and usage limits clearly [2].
- Models:
  - Host on Hugging Face with a rich model card describing training data, metrics per language, intended use, limitations, safety considerations, and known bias or failure modes [6][9].
  - Provide configuration files and compatible tokenizer files; test a minimal inference script against the hosted artifact to confirm reproducibility.
- Reproducibility and quality:
  - Provide a Docker image or conda environment; verify a clean-machine run.
  - If your venue uses artifact review/badging, target “Available” and “Reusable” standards (transparent docs, archived artifacts, automated runs) [10].

Step 3 — Camera-ready submission and archival uploads
- Venue platform (e.g., OpenReview):
  - Upload the camera-ready PDF and supplementary materials exactly as required; update metadata and paper abstract; include checklists and ethics statement where requested [11][1][3].
  - Confirm that all external links in the PDF are stable (Zenodo/HF DOIs, permanent URLs).
- arXiv preprint:
  - Submit LaTeX source (preferred) or a compliant PDF with all fonts embedded. Select an appropriate license, add a clear version note (e.g., “camera-ready version”) and stable links to code/data/models [4].
  - Use versioning: v1 as pre-rebuttal, v2 for post-acceptance camera-ready. Clearly summarize changes in arXiv “Comments” [4].
- Discoverability:
  - Link your code to arXiv so it appears on Papers with Code; optionally add your results to task pages/leaderboards if available [12].
  - Add DOIs to README, model/dataset cards, and the paper PDF.

Step 4 — Disclosure statements to include in the paper and artifacts
- Ethics statement (paper main text or appendix):
  - Data provenance, consent/terms, annotator protections, pay rates, demographics if collected, and de-identification policies [2][8].
  - Known/potential harms: misinformation, toxicity, culturally insensitive outputs, uneven performance across languages/dialects; risk mitigations and redress channels [1][2].
- Limitations and risks:
  - Coverage gaps (languages, dialects, scripts), code-switching robustness, translation noise, domain mismatch, and resource disparities.
- Data Statement (dataset card + paper appendix):
  - Motivation, languages/dialects and scripts, speaker demographics (if available), collection process, annotation schema, quality control, intended use, and known biases, per Bender & Friedman’s framework [8].
- Model Card (model card + paper appendix):
  - Model details, training data scope and licensing, evaluation across languages, intended uses, limitations, ethical considerations, and caveats per Mitchell et al. [9].
- Reproducibility checklist(s):
  - Parameters, resources, hardware, time, costs, and seeds; exact software versions and environment; any external services used [1][3].
- Compute and environmental disclosure:
  - Report GPU-hours, energy use, and estimated emissions; document measurement method (e.g., CodeCarbon/MLCO2 calculator) [14].
- Conflicts of interest and funding:
  - Acknowledge sponsors and potential conflicts in the paper and README [2].

Step 5 — Post-acceptance QA and maintenance
- Verify all artifacts are publicly accessible and match the paper’s claims.
- Monitor issue trackers and update FAQs for common setup or data questions.
- If you release patches, increment versions and update DOIs; reflect changes in arXiv “Comments” and model/dataset cards [4][5][6][7].

Cross-lingual dialogue–specific quality controls to add before camera-ready
- Unicode and script normalization: state your normalization and tokenization for each language/script; document handling of diacritics and code points (e.g., NFC/NFKC).
- Translation pipeline transparency: describe any forward/back-translation, MT system versions, quality checks, and human verification sampling protocol.
- Dialect and code-switching coverage: specify which dialects are present, any exclusions, and how you stratified evaluation; disclose disparities and error patterns.
- Safety across languages: run toxicity/offensiveness or safety checks on multilingual outputs; document measurement tools, thresholds, and limitations.
- Human evaluation: if used, provide sampling, instructions, inter-annotator agreement, language expertise required, and compensation.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments to strengthen the camera-ready
1) Translate-train vs translate-test vs direct-train for cross-lingual dialogue
- Hypothesis: For medium-resource target languages, translate-train (MT source data to target, then train) yields better context coherence than translate-test (MT outputs at inference) and approaches direct-train with target data.
- Design: Same model architecture and hyperparameters across three regimes. Train on English only (translate-test at inference), English→Target (translate-train), and Target-only. Evaluate on the same target-language test set.
- Metrics: BLEU/BERTScore for n-gram/semantic overlap; dialogue-specific next-turn accuracy or retrieval recall if applicable; human judgments of appropriateness and coherence on a 5-point Likert scale with inter-annotator agreement.
- Expected outcome: translate-train reduces degradation relative to translate-test; effect size varies by MT quality and domain.
- Falsifiable: If translate-test equals or outperforms translate-train on target-language coherence, the hypothesis is rejected.

2) Dialectal robustness and fairness across languages
- Hypothesis: Performance disparities across dialects within the same language exceed those across closely related standard varieties, revealing dialect sensitivity.
- Design: Curate or stratify test sets by dialect (e.g., MSA vs regional Arabic, Latin American vs Iberian Spanish; code-switched segments). Control for utterance length/domain. Train once; evaluate separately by dialect.
- Metrics: Same automatic metrics as your main task; report per-dialect scores and disparity metrics (max-min gap, Relative Error Increase). Optional: human error categorization by dialect.
- Expected outcome: Statistically significant performance gaps across dialects suggest the need for dialect-aware training or augmentation.
- Falsifiable: No significant per-dialect differences refutes the hypothesis.

3) Safety and toxicity consistency across languages
- Hypothesis: The model exhibits higher toxicity or stereotype content in lower-resource languages than in high-resource ones for similar prompts.
- Design: Use a multilingual prompt set with safety-sensitive cases; evaluate generations with multilingual toxicity classifiers and a human audit sample. Control temperature and max length; fix seeds.
- Metrics: Toxicity rate, severity bins, false-positive checks via human rating; report per-language rates with confidence intervals.
- Expected outcome: Measurable cross-language differences in safety outcomes; mitigation (e.g., safety fine-tuning) reduces gaps.
- Falsifiable: If per-language toxicity rates are statistically indistinguishable after correction, the hypothesis is rejected.

One–two literature anchors to justify disclosure practices
- Data Statements for NLP (Bender & Friedman, 2018) — provides a structured approach to dataset documentation [8].
- Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al., 2019) — standardized model reporting focusing on intended use, limitations, and ethics [9].
