Here’s a concise, practical submission checklist for “Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?”, with a concrete final timeline, key risks, and missing items to resolve. I also propose falsifiable experiments, grounded where possible in prior work on transfer in histopathology and standardized cross-dataset evaluation.

Core submission checklist
- Scope and claims
  - Clearly state the transfer setting(s): cross-dataset, cross-institution, cross-task, or domain shift type (e.g., stain/protocol). Define “transfer” operationally (train on source, test on target; or fine-tune on small target set).
  - Position against prior work on histopathology transfer learning and standardized evaluation toolkits (e.g., ChampKit) to motivate choice of datasets/splits and metrics [P1][P3].
- Datasets and splits
  - List all datasets with licenses, inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient counts, slide counts, patch sampling scheme, and label provenance.
  - Ensure patient-level, site-level, and slide-level leakage controls; document all split seeds.
  - Specify source→target pairs, sample sizes, and whether target labels are used (zero-shot vs few-shot).
- Models and baselines
  - MIL models/pooling: mean/max pooling, attention-based MIL, and at least one strong recent MIL variant as a sanity check baseline. Describe instance encoder (e.g., ResNet/ViT), bag size, and sampling.
  - Transfer levers: supervised ImageNet pretraining vs self-supervised pretraining (e.g., DINO/MoCo/MAE) [P2]; frozen vs fine-tuned encoders; stain normalization/augmentations; domain generalization baselines.
- Training protocol
  - Hyperparameter search space, scheduler, early stopping criteria, and number of random seeds (≥3 recommended).
  - Compute budget (GPU type, hours), mixed precision, batch size; total runs required.
- Evaluation and statistics
  - Primary metrics: ROC-AUC and/or AP; class prevalence-aware reporting.
  - Secondary: calibration (ECE/Brier), decision thresholds (Youden), confidence intervals (bootstrap stratified by patient).
  - Stability analyses: performance distribution across seeds; delta under target-data size changes.
  - Negative transfer check: quantify source→target drop versus target-only training [P1].
- Robustness/shift analysis
  - Out-of-distribution tests across sites/scanners; stain jitter vs normalization ablation.
  - Failure mode analysis (qualitative WSI regions; error stratified by site/tissue/subtype).
- Ablations
  - Pooling mechanism; pretraining choice; frozen vs fine-tuned; bag size/instance sampling; color normalization; data size scaling (log-scale plots).
- Reproducibility package
  - Code with pinned dependencies; config files for each run; scripts to download/prepare data; exact seeds and splits; deterministic flags where feasible.
  - Model checkpoints; README with 1-command reproduction; compute and carbon reporting.
- Writing and artifacts
  - Figures: pipeline diagram; transfer matrix (source rows × target columns); calibration curves; seed-violin plots.
  - Tables: metric means±CI; ablation summary; compute cost table.
  - Limitations, ethics/data statement, licensing, author contributions, COI.
  - Venue formatting, anonymization (if applicable), supplementary checklist.

Experiments to finalize (falsifiable; report mean±95% CI; n≥3 seeds)
1) Pretraining strategy vs transfer
- Hypothesis: Self-supervised pretraining improves cross-dataset transfer compared to supervised ImageNet pretraining.
- Variables: Pretraining method (Supervised-ImageNet vs SSL method), encoder fixed; same MIL head and training budget.
- Metrics: Target-domain ROC-AUC/AP; calibration (ECE); negative transfer gap relative to target-only training.
- Expected outcome: SSL ≥ supervised for transfer robustness in histopathology, consistent with prior indications that SSL benefits histopathology representations [P2] and that transfer choices matter [P1].
2) Pooling mechanism effect on transfer
- Hypothesis: Attention-based MIL transfers better than mean/max pooling due to instance weighting.
- Variables: Pooling (mean, max, attention); keep encoder/pretraining fixed.
- Metrics: Cross-dataset ROC-AUC/AP; seed stability; calibration.
- Expected outcome: Attention > mean/max on target; if not, report conditions (bag size, label noise) under which simple pooling is competitive.
3) Frozen vs fine-tuned instance encoders
- Hypothesis: Light fine-tuning (e.g., last N layers) on source improves transfer less than or equal to full fine-tuning; in limited-target fine-tuning, frozen+linear may avoid overfitting.
- Variables: Encoder training regime (frozen, partial, full); same data and head.
- Metrics: Source performance; target zero-shot performance; few-shot target fine-tune performance.
- Expected outcome: Full fine-tune best on source; frozen/partial may retain or improve zero-shot transfer when domains diverge, aligning with transfer-learning sensitivity observed in histopathology [P1].
4) Domain shift defenses
- Hypothesis: Stain normalization and aggressive color/texture augmentations reduce transfer drop relative to naive training.
- Variables: No normalization vs Macenko/Reinhard normalization; light vs strong color jitter; optional domain generalization baseline.
- Metrics: Target ROC-AUC/AP; delta in negative transfer; calibration.
- Expected outcome: Normalization/augmentations shrink the source→target gap; report failure cases if not.

Final timeline (4 weeks; adjust to venue deadline)
- Week 1: Lock scope and datasets; finalize splits; implement baselines and logging; run sanity checks (within-dataset). Kick off Experiment 1 (pretraining) small-scale; prepare figures templates. Anchor against prior transfer studies [P1][P3].
- Week 2: Run Experiments 1–3 at scale (≥3 seeds); start Experiment 4; compute CI and calibration; generate initial transfer matrix; draft Methods and Experiments.
- Week 3: Complete robustness, failure analyses, and ablations; finalize tables/figures; write Results, Limitations, and Ethics/Data statements; internal replication on a second machine/seed pack; package code/checkpoints with 1-command scripts.
- Week 4: Polishing and compliance: reproducibility checklist, artifact evaluation dry-run, formatting/anonymization, references. External read-through. Submit.

Key risks and mitigations
- Data leakage (patient/site-level): Impact high. Mitigation: enforce patient/site stratification; audit IDs; include leakage test script in repo.
- Negative transfer or unstable results across seeds: Impact medium. Mitigation: report seed distributions, CIs; include target-only baseline; predefine early stopping on source only; analyze shift drivers [P1].
- Incomplete external validity (too few target domains): Impact medium. Mitigation: include ≥2 target datasets or ≥2 institutions if feasible; leverage standardized evaluation protocols/tools where possible [P3].
- Compute/time overrun: Impact medium. Mitigation: cap search spaces; use fixed seeds; parallelize runs; prioritize Experiments 1–3; maintain a must-have vs nice-to-have list.
- Reproducibility gaps: Impact medium. Mitigation: pin versions; save configs and random states; release checkpoints; provide CPU-only inference path.
- Ethical/legal constraints (data use/licensing): Impact variable. Mitigation: confirm dataset licenses/DUAs; include data statement; avoid sharing restricted data—share scripts.

- Hyperparameter search protocol and bounds; early stopping criteria; number of seeds.
- Calibration/evaluation details (ECE bins, bootstrap plan), and choice of primary vs secondary metrics.
- Compute disclosure (hardware, hours), carbon estimate (optional).
- Model release plan (code, configs, weights), license, and README with one-command reproduction.
- Final figures: pipeline, transfer matrix, calibration curves, seed stability, ablation summary.
- Limitations and ethics/data-use statement.

Notes on evidence
- Prior work indicates that transfer-learning design choices materially affect histopathology performance [P1], and community toolkits exist to standardize transfer evaluations [P3]. Self-supervised pretraining is a reasonable comparator given its effectiveness in histopathology representation learning [P2]. Claims above are framed as hypotheses with falsifiable experiments and should be validated empirically.

If you share your target venue and deadline, I can tailor the checklist to that venue’s artifact/reproducibility requirements and compress the timeline if needed.
