Below is a compact, reviewer-aligned submission checklist for “Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?”, plus a realistic final timeline, key risks, and missing items to address before submission. I’ve assumed a general ML venue (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR); adapt minor venue-specific items as needed.

Submission checklist (what reviewers and ACs expect)

A) Problem framing and claims
- Clear problem statement: Define “transfer” precisely (e.g., source→target performance without target labels, few-shot, or fine-tune). State hypotheses and success criteria.
- Scope: Clarify MIL setting (bag definition, label granularity), domains (e.g., histopathology, audio, remote sensing), and intended generality.

B) Datasets and splits
- Dataset ledger in the paper and repo: name, version/date, URL/DOI, license (SPDX/link), bag construction, instance preprocessing, label provenance, and whether you redistribute anything.
- Train/val/test protocol: No leakage across domains; document dedup and near-duplicate removal across source–target pairs. Describe bag size distributions and how they differ across domains.
- Transfer protocol: State if zero-shot, frozen-feature evaluation, linear probe, or full fine-tune. Hyperparameters chosen only on source (for zero-shot) or with a fixed small target-valid set; no target-test peeking.

C) Methods and baselines
- Baselines: Strong MIL variants (e.g., Attention-MIL, mean/Max pooling, Set-Transformer/Transformer-based MIL) and simple non-MIL baselines (e.g., instance-level majority vote, linear probe on pooled features).
- Ablations: Pooling mechanism, instance encoder (frozen vs fine-tuned), bag size effects, domain-specific vs domain-agnostic normalization.
- Metrics: Primary (e.g., AUROC/AUPRC/accuracy) with 95% CIs; calibration (ECE/Brier); efficiency (params, inference latency per bag, memory).
- Statistics: Paired bootstrap or DeLong test where applicable; report variance across seeds.

D) Ethics/compliance and reproducibility
- Licenses/TOS: Ledger and attributions; confirm redistribution permissions for data and checkpoints. Exclude NC/SA/TOS-restricted sources or align model license.
- Human data: If present, IRB/ethics approval or exemption ID, consent, compensation details; data de-identification and sharing plan.
- Compute disclosure: Hardware counts, device-hours, software versions, kernels/backends, seeds; energy/emissions estimate with assumptions.
- Safety impacts: If domains involve sensitive content, report pre/post-transfer shifts in toxicity/bias (even a brief audit if relevant).
- Artifacts: Code, configs, scripts, seeds, environment files; pretrained weights; data download scripts (not raw mirrors); LICENSE + NOTICE with third-party attributions.
- Checklists: Venue ethics/reproducibility checklist completed; model/data cards linked in appendix or repo.

E) Writing, formatting, and packaging
- Anonymization and template compliance; page limits respected; appendices for extra details.
- Figures/tables: Legible, with captions stating protocol (zero-shot vs fine-tuned), data regimes, and bag statistics.
- Negative results: Explicitly reported; position them as empirical evidence informing transfer boundaries.
- Supplementary: Detailed protocols, hyperparameter tables, failure analyses, per-domain results, and data access notes.
- README: One-command reproduction for 1–2 core experiments; results table expected vs obtained.

Final timeline (8 weeks to submission; compress if needed)

Week 1: Protocol freeze and risk audit
- Lock transfer settings (zero-shot/few-shot/fine-tune), datasets, and baselines.
- Run license/TOS audit; remove/replace restricted sources. Draft dataset ledger.

Week 2: Reproducible pipeline + seed sweep
- Solidify training/eval scripts; pin versions; implement dedup across domains.
- Run 3-seed baselines on source and one target; validate splits and CIs.

Week 3: Core experiments across all domains
- Complete zero-shot and few-shot transfer runs across all source–target pairs.
- Log compute, memory, latency per bag; begin emissions calculation.

Week 4: Ablations and diagnostics
- Pooling, bag-size stress tests, frozen vs fine-tuned encoders.
- Calibration and robustness checks; preliminary failure analysis.

Week 5: Writing pass 1 + artifacts
- Draft main paper (Intro/Related/Method/Exp), appendices, and dataset ledger.
- Prepare code release (private repo), model/data cards, LICENSE/NOTICE.

Week 6: Completeness + ethics/repro
- Add compute/emissions section; finalize checklists (ethics, reproducibility).
- IRB statement (if applicable); safety audit results (if applicable).

Week 7: Polishing and external read
- Tighten figures/tables; ensure results reproducible from scripts.
- External dry-run review; address clarity/positioning/novelty concerns.

Week 8: Final buffer
- Finalize supplementary; verify template/anonymization.
- Tag release commit; archive artifacts (e.g., Zenodo) for stable DOIs.
- Submit 48–72 hours before deadline.

Key risks and mitigations

Methodological/empirical
- Risk: Hyperparameter tuning on target data inflates “transfer.” Mitigation: Tune only on source; if few-shot, strictly document target budget; use held-out target test.
- Risk: Cross-domain leakage (duplicates). Mitigation: Perceptual hashing/embedding similarity dedup across domains before splitting.
- Risk: Weak baselines. Mitigation: Include attention-MIL and transformer-style MIL; add simple non-MIL baselines; report calibration and efficiency.
- Risk: Unclear transfer definition. Mitigation: Pre-register definitions and success criteria; report all regimes (zero-shot, few-shot, full fine-tune) side-by-side.

Compliance/review
- Risk: Licensing/TOS conflicts or missing attributions. Mitigation: Dataset ledger; scripts-only redistribution; align model license.
- Risk: Missing compute/emissions disclosure. Mitigation: Include device-hours, power/PUE assumptions, and formula; release seeds/configs.
- Risk: Paper hygiene (formatting/anonymity/checklists). Mitigation: Internal “desk-reject” pass 1 week before deadline.

Likely missing items to fill now
- Dataset ledger with license IDs, versions, URLs, and attribution statements.
- Explicit transfer protocol (zero-shot/few-shot/fine-tune) and tuning policy.
- Deduplication method and confirmation across domains.
- Confidence intervals and statistical tests; seed counts specified.
- Calibration metrics (ECE/Brier) and reliability diagrams.
- Compute/emissions appendix with formulas and assumptions.
- Reproducibility package: exact configs, seeds, environment, and run scripts.
- Ethics/IRB statement (if human data); safety/bias audit note if applicable.
- Model/data cards; LICENSE and NOTICE with third-party attributions.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments to de-risk reviews

1) Cross-domain zero-shot transfer matrix
- Setup: Train MIL on each source domain; evaluate zero-shot on all targets. Hyperparameters chosen on source only; no target tuning. 3–5 seeds.
- Hypothesis: Attention-based MIL transfers better than mean/Max pooling across ≥50% of source–target pairs.
- Measurements: AUROC/AUPRC with 95% CIs; paired bootstrap or DeLong for differences.
- Falsification: If attention-MIL is not significantly better than simple pooling on most pairs, claim is rejected or must be narrowed.

2) Bag-size distribution sensitivity
- Setup: For a fixed source-trained model, evaluate on target subsets stratified by bag size (e.g., terciles) and on synthetic re-bagging that matches source vs target distributions.
- Hypothesis: Performance drop correlates with bag-size shift; bag-size-aware normalization or attention temperature fixes ≥50% of the gap.
- Measurements: AUROC vs bag size; regression of performance vs bag-size mismatch; ablation with/without normalization.
- Falsification: No significant correlation or mitigation effect implies bag-size shift is not the driver; revise mechanism claims.

3) Frozen vs fine-tuned instance encoders
- Setup: Compare transfer with frozen self-supervised encoder (e.g., DINO/SimCLR) + MIL head vs end-to-end fine-tuning on source only.
- Hypothesis: Frozen encoders yield equal or better zero-shot transfer than end-to-end source fine-tuning in at least two target domains due to reduced overfitting to source.
- Measurements: AUROC/CIs; calibration metrics; parameter/compute costs.
- Falsification: If fine-tuning consistently outperforms frozen across targets, adjust recommendations and analysis.

Optional robustness additions (if time permits)
- Label noise stress test at bag level (e.g., 10–20% flips) and its effect on transfer.
- OOD detection/calibration under domain shift (ECE/Brier; temperature scaling fit on source only).
- Duplicate/near-duplicate removal ablation showing its effect on transfer estimates.

Quick package pre-flight (tick before submitting)

- Code: One-command reproduction; seeds/configs/checkpoints; LICENSE/NOTICE; third-party attributions.
- Data: No redistribution of restricted data; scripts to re-fetch; dedup documented.
- Results: All regimes reported (zero-shot/few-shot/fine-tune) or explicitly scoped; negative results included with analysis.
