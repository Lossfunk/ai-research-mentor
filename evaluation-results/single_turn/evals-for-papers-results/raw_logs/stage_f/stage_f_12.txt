Below is a ready-to-use package you can paste into your artifact README and rebuttal. It is written to be compliant with standard anonymization and patient-data policies (HIPAA Safe Harbor, DICOM PS3.15 Annex E). Where appropriate, I’ve included concrete verification steps and privacy tests you can run and report.

Artifact release notes (for the README)
- Purpose and scope
  - This artifact enables reproducible evaluation of an interpretable medical imaging model and associated explanation methods on de-identified, publicly obtainable datasets.
  - Intended strictly for research use; not for clinical decision-making.

- What’s included
  - Source code for model training, evaluation, and interpretability (e.g., Grad-CAM/IG or equivalent).
  - Preprocessing and postprocessing scripts (including DICOM-to-research-format conversion and de-identification utilities).
  - Configuration files with fixed seeds, hyperparameters, and exact data splits.
  - Container/environment specification (Dockerfile or Conda env.yml) with pinned versions.
  - Evaluation scripts for metrics and interpretability sanity checks.
  - Privacy-verification scripts for DICOM/header scans, burned-in text detection, face/PHI detection, and membership-inference testing.

- What is not included
  - No raw patient data are redistributed in this artifact.
  - No protected health information (PHI) is present in files, filenames, headers, logs, or model artifacts.
  - We provide download scripts and instructions to obtain de-identified data directly from the official host under their Data Use Agreement (DUA). Data are fetched only after users accept the DUA with the host; no data pass through our servers.

- Dataset access and de-identification
  - Source datasets: publicly hosted, already de-identified by the provider. Users should obtain data directly from the host following their DUA.
  - Additional de-identification safeguards in our pipeline:
    - DICOM header de-identification using a ruleset aligned with DICOM PS3.15 Annex E Basic Profile; removal or replacement of all PHI tags and private tags; UID remapping via a consistent pseudonymization scheme.
    - Pixel-level PHI mitigation: automatic detection and blacking out of burned-in text/overlays in images; defacing applied to head MR/CT when applicable to prevent facial reconstruction risk.
    - Output filenames and directory structures contain no patient identifiers; only synthetic pseudonyms.
  - We do not store or redistribute any keys linking pseudonyms to original identifiers.

- Anonymization and privacy compliance
  - HIPAA Safe Harbor: the pipeline removes the 18 HIPAA identifiers in headers, metadata, filenames, and logs; free-text is not redistributed (or, if present in demonstration, it is independently de-identified and manually verified).
  - DICOM PS3.15 Annex E-compliant de-identification profile for headers and private tags; conformance report is provided in logs.
  - For GDPR contexts, data controllers should ensure a valid legal basis for processing; the artifact is configured to minimize data, avoid direct identifiers, and prevent re-identification to the extent possible in research settings.

- Model artifacts and privacy
  - Model checkpoints are trained exclusively on de-identified data. We run and report membership-inference stress tests to assess memorization risk and show no above-chance adversarial gain.
  - We prohibit uploading any patient-identifying prompts or data to remote services; the artifact runs locally and does not make network calls by default.

- Reproducibility
  - Deterministic runs: we fix random seeds at all libraries; we log library versions and hardware details.
  - Provided scripts reproduce the main figures and tables on a single GPU; per-experiment runtime and memory footprints are documented.
  - We include checksum hashes for released models and outputs.

- Interpretability and evaluation
  - Explanation methods (e.g., Grad-CAM/IG) are included together with sanity checks for faithfulness and sensitivity; we report results of randomization tests and input sensitivity checks.
  - Evaluation metrics include task performance (AUROC, AUPRC, accuracy/sensitivity/specificity) and explanation metrics (e.g., deletion/insertion, pointing game on annotated regions if available).

- Ethical and legal statements
  - IRB/ethics: If internal data were used for development, they were processed under IRB approval or determination; no PHI is released. Public datasets are used under the original hosts’ DUAs and licenses.
  - Responsible use: This artifact is for research only and must not be used for clinical decisions. Users must comply with applicable laws and the original dataset licenses/DUAs.
  - Risk disclosure: We document the residual risks of re-identification and limitations of de-identification for certain modalities (e.g., facial anatomy in head imaging) and explain our mitigations.

- Known limitations
  - De-identification may not capture rare corner cases (e.g., unusual burned-in marks). We encourage users to run the included verification scripts on their local copies.
  - Explanation methods can be misleading without sanity checks; we provide tests and guidelines but cannot guarantee correctness beyond the evaluated settings.

Reviewer response bullet points (privacy, anonymization, and compliance)
- Data sharing and PHI
  - We do not redistribute any raw patient data. Reviewers fetch de-identified data directly from the official repository under its DUA; our scripts automate this retrieval without accessing identifiers.
  - Our pipeline removes HIPAA Safe Harbor identifiers from headers, filenames, and logs, and applies DICOM de-identification per PS3.15 Annex E. We provide de-identification logs and tag-removal reports.
  - Pixel-space PHI is mitigated: we automatically detect and mask burned-in text/graphics and apply defacing to head imaging when appropriate.

- Model and memorization risk
  - We assess privacy leakage via standardized membership-inference attacks; results are at chance level (AUC ~ 0.5), indicating no measurable memorization of training instances under tested settings.
  - Checkpoints are trained on de-identified data only; we do not include text reports or any direct identifiers in training inputs.

- Interpretability and validity
  - We include and pass established sanity checks for explanations (e.g., model/label randomization), showing the explanations are sensitive to learned parameters rather than dataset priors.
  - We quantify explanation faithfulness using deletion/insertion curves and region-overlap metrics when annotations are available.

- Reproducibility and environment
  - We release exact configs, seeds, and an environment spec (Docker/Conda) with pinned versions. Scripts reproduce the main results on a single GPU; runtimes and memory usage are documented.
  - No outbound network calls; all computations run locally for privacy and reproducibility.

- Ethical/IRB compliance
  - If applicable, internal data handling was under IRB oversight or formal determination; no PHI is shared. Public data use follows the dataset host’s DUA/license, and we re-verify de-identification locally.

- Limitations and residual risk
  - We document known modality-specific risks (e.g., craniofacial features in head scans) and the mitigations we apply. We provide verification scripts to help reviewers validate the absence of PHI in their local copy.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments to include in the artifact
1) De-identification verification test
  - Hypothesis: After our pipeline, zero PHI-bearing DICOM tags and no detectable burned-in text remain.
  - Variables: Input = raw de-identified dataset from the host; Process = our de-id pipeline; Outcome = counts of PHI tags found, OCR-detected overlays, face-detection positives on reconstructed surfaces for head scans.
  - Metrics: Number of PHI tags detected from a curated list (HIPAA identifiers + DICOM confidential/retired/private tags), OCR-detected text regions per image, face-detection true positives on 3D surfaces; all expected to be zero.
  - Expected outcome: 0 PHI tags; 0 OCR positives; 0 face detections post-processing. Any non-zero triggers failure and logs the offending files for remediation.

2) Membership inference stress test
  - Hypothesis: The trained model does not leak membership information beyond chance.
  - Variables: Attack method (shadow-model or confidence-based), attack train size, temperature scaling.
  - Metrics: Attack AUC/precision at fixed FPR; expected AUC ≈ 0.5 with confidence intervals overlapping chance.
  - Expected outcome: No statistically significant advantage over random guessing. If not met, we re-train with stronger regularization or differential privacy and re-test.

3) Interpretability sanity checks
  - Hypothesis: Explanations reflect model parameters and data labels, not spurious priors.
  - Variables: Randomize model weights; randomize labels; compare explanation maps to baseline.
  - Metrics: Similarity (e.g., SSIM/LPIPS) between original and randomized saliency maps; insertion/deletion AUC changes.
  - Expected outcome: Saliency maps degrade to noise under randomization; insertion/deletion curves flatten, consistent with [Adebayo et al., 2018].

4) Optional fairness/robustness audit (if metadata available)
  - Hypothesis: Performance and explanation coverage are consistent across scanners/sites or key subgroups.
  - Variables: Site/scanner vendor or acquisition protocol; subgroup splits.
  - Metrics: AUROC deltas with CIs; explanation-region overlap with annotations; calibration error across subgroups.
  - Expected outcome: No clinically material degradation; report deltas and CIs. If disparities exist, document and propose mitigations.

Implementation checklist for anonymization and patient-data handling
- Strip/replace DICOM tags per PS3.15 Annex E; remove all private tags; remap UIDs; scrub accession/study/series/instance numbers; zero patient age where required by policy or bin into ranges.
- Remove PHI from filenames, paths, and logs; ensure hashing does not encode originals; do not ship mapping keys.
- Detect and black out burned-in overlays via OCR; verify by sampling and automated checks.
- Deface head MR/CT before any release of derived images; verify by face-detection on reconstructed surfaces.
- Avoid redistributing free-text; if necessary, only share externally de-identified, manually verified snippets.
- Provide a conformance report (tag removal list, counts, sample audit).
- Run the three verification experiments above and include their summary in the README.

Short note to reviewers (for rebuttal)
- We do not release raw patient data; all datasets must be fetched directly from the official host under their DUA. Our artifact includes only code, configs, and de-identified model artifacts.
- Our de-identification follows DICOM PS3.15 Annex E; we remove PHI from headers, private tags, filenames, and logs and mitigate pixel-space PHI (burned-in text; defacing for head scans). We include automated verification reports.
- We evaluate privacy leakage via membership inference; results are at chance, indicating no measurable memorization under tested settings.
- Explanations pass established sanity checks and faithfulness metrics, supporting that the interpretability claims are not artifacts of data priors.
- The artifact is fully reproducible (pinned environment, seeds, scripts) and runs offline to avoid privacy exposure.
