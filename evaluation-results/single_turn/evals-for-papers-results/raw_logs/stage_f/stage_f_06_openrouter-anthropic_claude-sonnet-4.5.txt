I'll create comprehensive double-blind compliance guidance for your human-centered AI evaluation paper. To provide **specific, line-by-line fixes**, please upload your paper PDF.

In the meantime, here's a complete compliance framework:

---

## 🔒 DOUBLE-BLIND COMPLIANCE GUIDE: Human-Centered AI Evaluation

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Human-Centered AI Papers Have Unique Anonymization Risks

Human evaluation studies are **high-risk** for de-anonymization through:
- Participant recruitment details (institution, demographics)
- IRB approval numbers
- User study platforms/interfaces (screenshots with branding)
- Qualitative quotes (identifying language, context)
- Crowdsourcing platform details
- Collaboration acknowledgments in study design

---

## 📋 SECTION 1: CORE ANONYMIZATION CHECKLIST

### A. Author Identification Removal

#### Standard Removals
- [ ] **Author names** removed from title page
- [ ] **Affiliations** removed
- [ ] **Email addresses** removed
- [ ] **Acknowledgments section** deleted (restore after acceptance)
- [ ] **Funding statements** removed
- [ ] **Author contributions** removed (if separate section)
- [ ] **Corresponding author** notation removed

#### LaTeX Template Fixes
```latex
% ❌ WRONG (reveals identity)
\author{Jane Smith\\
  Stanford University\\
  \texttt{jsmith@stanford.edu}}

% ✅ CORRECT (anonymized)
\author{Anonymous Submission}
% OR for some venues:
\author{Anonymous Authors\\
  Paper ID: 1234}

% Remove acknowledgments during review
% \section*{Acknowledgments}
% We thank our collaborators at XYZ Lab...
% [RESTORE AFTER ACCEPTANCE]
```

#### PDF Metadata Scrubbing
- [ ] **Author field** in PDF properties cleared
- [ ] **Creator/Producer** fields checked (may reveal institution)
- [ ] **Keywords** don't include identifying terms

**How to check:**
```bash
# Check PDF metadata
pdfinfo paper.pdf

# Clean metadata (Linux/Mac)
exiftool -all:all= paper.pdf

# Or use LaTeX:
\hypersetup{
  pdfauthor={},
  pdfcreator={},
  pdfproducer={}
}
```

---

### B. Self-Citation Anonymization

#### Rule: You CAN cite your own work, but must anonymize references to it

**Citation Patterns:**

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (reveals identity)
Building on our previous work [Smith et al. 2023], we extend...
In [5], we showed that...
As we demonstrated in Smith et al. [12]...

% ✅ CORRECT (anonymized)
Building on previous work [5], this paper extends...
Prior work [5] showed that...
Smith et al. [5] demonstrated...

% In references:
% ❌ WRONG
\bibitem{smith2023}
Jane Smith, John Doe. 
``Our Previous Paper.''
\emph{ACL 2023}.

% ✅ CORRECT (same citation, neutral language)
\bibitem{smith2023}
Jane Smith, John Doe. 
``Previous Paper Title.''
\emph{ACL 2023}.
```

**Key principle**: Cite your work in third person, don't use possessive language ("our", "we previously")

#### Handling Unpublished/Concurrent Work

```latex
% ❌ WRONG
We build on our concurrent submission to NeurIPS [Anonymous, 2024]

% ✅ CORRECT (if allowed by venue)
We build on concurrent work [6]. 
% In references:
[6] Anonymous. Under review. Details omitted for double-blind review.

% ✅ BETTER (if venue allows)
We build on recent work on [topic]. Full citation omitted for anonymity.
```

**Venue-specific policies:**
- **ACL/EMNLP**: Can cite own work, must anonymize discussion
- **NeurIPS/ICML**: Can cite own work, must not reveal identity
- **CHI/CSCW**: Can cite own work, use neutral language
- **UIST/IUI**: Same as CHI

### C. Human-Centered AI Specific Anonymization 🔴 HIGH RISK

#### 1. IRB Approval Anonymization

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (reveals institution)
This study was approved by the Stanford University IRB 
(Protocol #2024-12345).

% ❌ WRONG (IRB number may be searchable)
IRB approval obtained (Protocol #2024-12345).

% ✅ CORRECT
This study was approved by our institutional review board.

% ✅ ALSO CORRECT (if venue requires proof)
This study was approved by an institutional review board 
(approval letter in supplementary material, with identifying 
information redacted).
```

**For supplementary material:**
- [ ] Redact institution name from IRB letter
- [ ] Redact IRB protocol number (if searchable online)
- [ ] Redact investigator names

Participants included 3 Navajo speakers from our local community.

% ✅ CORRECT (aggregate when possible)
Participants included speakers of underrepresented languages.

% ✅ ALSO CORRECT (if specificity needed)
Participants included speakers of Indigenous North American 
languages (specific languages anonymized for review).
```

#### 3. Study Platform/Interface Anonymization

**Screenshots and figures:**
- [ ] Remove institutional logos from UI
- [ ] Remove university branding (colors, fonts, mascots)
- [ ] Remove URLs that reveal institution (e.g., `stanford.edu/study`)
- [ ] Remove researcher names from interfaces
- [ ] Remove lab names from consent forms
- [ ] Blur background elements in photos (campus buildings, posters)

**Example fixes:**
```latex
% In figure captions:

% ✅ CORRECT
\caption{Screenshot of the study interface (institutional 
branding removed for anonymity).}

% For URLs in study materials:
% ❌ WRONG
Participants accessed the study at https://hci.stanford.edu/study2024

% ✅ CORRECT

P12: "As a student, I found this helpful."
P3: "Our lab tried something similar."

% ✅ ALSO CORRECT (note redaction)
P7: "I use this in my [INSTITUTION] classes all the time."
```

**Handling rare/identifying characteristics:**
```latex
% ❌ WRONG (may identify individual)
P5, a 67-year-old Tibetan-speaking female professor of 
linguistics at our institution, noted...

% ✅ CORRECT (aggregate)
An older participant with expertise in linguistics noted...

% ✅ ALSO CORRECT (if detail needed)
A participant with relevant domain expertise (demographics 
anonymized) noted...
```

#### 5. Crowdsourcing Platform Details

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (may reveal timing/identity)
We recruited 500 workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk in 
March 2024 using our lab's requester account.

% ✅ CORRECT
We recruited 500 crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk.

% ✅ ALSO CORRECT (if timing matters)
We recruited 500 crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk 
over a 2-week period in early 2024.

% For payment details:
% ❌ WRONG
Workers were paid $15/hour, consistent with our university's 
minimum wage policy.

% ✅ CORRECT
Workers were paid $15/hour, consistent with ethical 
crowdsourcing guidelines [cite].
```

#### 6. Collaborator/Stakeholder Anonymization

```latex
% ❌ WRONG
We collaborated with Dr. Jane Smith from the Stanford 
Medical School to design the study.

We worked with our industry partner, Google, to deploy the system.

% ✅ CORRECT
We collaborated with a domain expert from a medical school 
to design the study.

     # Get anonymous link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/XXXX
     ```

2. **Dropbox/Google Drive** (anonymous account)
   - Pros: Simple, reliable
   - Cons: No version control, less professional
   - Setup:
     ```bash
     # Create new anonymous email (e.g., anon.hci.eval@gmail.com)
     # Upload code as ZIP
     # Share with "Anyone with link"
     ```

3. **Zenodo Sandbox** (https://sandbox.zenodo.org/)

\item \textbf{Study materials}: Anonymized versions of study 
protocols, consent forms, and task instructions will be included.
\end{itemize}
```

### B. Data Release Strategies

#### Human Evaluation Data: Privacy Considerations

**What you CAN release:**
- [ ] Aggregated statistics (means, medians, counts)
- [ ] Anonymized ratings/scores (no demographic links)
- [ ] De-identified qualitative codes
- [ ] Synthetic data matching real data distributions
- [ ] Task completion times, error rates (aggregated)

**What you CANNOT release:**
- [ ] ❌ Raw transcripts with identifying information
- [ ] ❌ Video/audio recordings (even with consent)
- [ ] ❌ Demographic data linked to individual responses
- [ ] ❌ Free-text responses that may identify participants
- [ ] ❌ IP addresses, timestamps, or other metadata

**Anonymization strategies:**

1. **K-anonymity**: Ensure each participant is indistinguishable from at least k-1 others
   ```python
   # Example: Generalize ages to ranges
   # Before: [23, 24, 25, 45, 46, 67]
   # After: [20-30, 20-30, 20-30, 40-50, 40-50, 60-70]
   ```

2. **Aggregation**: Report only group-level statistics
   ```latex
   % ❌ WRONG (individual-level)
   P1 rated the system 4/5, P2 rated 5/5, P3 rated 3/5...
   
   % ✅ CORRECT (aggregated)
   Mean rating: 4.2/5 (SD=0.8, N=50)
   ```

3. **Suppression**: Remove rare/identifying attributes
   ```latex
   % ❌ WRONG (may identify individual)
   One participant, a 72-year-old Tibetan-speaking female 
   professor, noted...
   
   % ✅ CORRECT (suppressed)
   An older participant with relevant expertise noted...
   ```

4. **Perturbation**: Add noise to preserve privacy
   ```python
   # Add Laplace noise to counts
   import numpy as np
   true_count = 47
   noisy_count = true_count + np.random.laplace(0, 1)
   # Report: "Approximately 47 participants..."
   ```

#### Data Release Template

```latex
\section{Data Availability Statement}

## 📋 SECTION 5: COMMON ANONYMIZATION MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Revealing Identity Through Timing

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (reveals when study was conducted, may identify)
We conducted our study in March 2024, coinciding with the 
launch of our lab's new AI initiative.

% ✅ CORRECT
We conducted our study over a 4-week period in early 2024.
```

### Mistake 2: Unique Dataset Descriptions

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (unique dataset may be identifiable)
We use a dataset of 10,000 Uyghur-English parallel sentences 
collected from our ongoing translation project.

% ✅ CORRECT
We use a dataset of 10,000 low-resource language parallel 
sentences (language pair anonymized for review).

% ✅ AFTER ACCEPTANCE
We use a dataset of 10,000 Uyghur-English parallel sentences 
from [cite your project].
```

### Mistake 3: Revealing Identity Through Figures

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (figure caption)
\caption{Our lab's user study room at Stanford, showing 
participants interacting with the system.}

% ✅ CORRECT
\caption{User study setup showing participants interacting 
with the system (location anonymized).}
```

### Mistake 4: Acknowledgments in Code Comments

```python
# ❌ WRONG (in code)
# This code was developed by Jane Smith at Stanford HCI Lab
# Thanks to John Doe for help with the interface design
# Funded by NSF Grant #12345

# ✅ CORRECT
# This code implements the evaluation framework described 
# in our paper
# Anonymous submission for [VENUE] 2024
```

### Mistake 5: Revealing Identity Through URLs

```latex
% ❌ WRONG
Participants accessed the study at: 
\url{https://hci.stanford.edu/studies/ai-eval-2024}

% ✅ CORRECT
Participants accessed the study via a web interface 
(URL anonymized for review).

% ✅ ALSO CORRECT (if URL needed)
Participants accessed the study at: 
\url{https://anonymous-study-platform.com/study-XXXX}
```

### Mistake 6: Revealing Identity Through Rare Characteristics

```latex
% ❌ WRONG (combination of characteristics may identify)
We recruited 5 participants who are native Quechua speakers, 
hold PhDs in linguistics, and work at universities in the 
Northeastern United States.

% ✅ CORRECT
We recruited 5 participants with expertise in low-resource 
languages and formal linguistics training.
