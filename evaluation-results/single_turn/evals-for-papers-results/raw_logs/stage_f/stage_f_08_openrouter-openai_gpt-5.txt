Below is a venue-specific submission plan for a robotics safety paper, focusing on supplemental video requirements, artifact checklists, and ethical review steps. I highlight what to prepare for each venue and a six-week countdown plan. Where requirements vary yearly, I point to the current pages to confirm exact limits.

Venue-specific expectations and video requirements

Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS)
- Submission/platform: RSS uses a standard ML-style submission with optional supplementary materials; videos are common but not mandated. Confirm current-year author info and any updated multimedia guidance before upload [1].
- Video format guidance: Provide an H.264 MP4 with captions and a brief title/legend slate; keep a short “results montage” that shows safety-critical interactions with readable overlays (E‑stop, fail-safes). Ensure audio narration does not deanonymize if under double-blind review [1][4].
- Artifacts: Code/sim release encouraged but not required; provide a repo with simulator configuration and evaluation scripts. Include a safety evaluation protocol PDF in the supplement [1].

IROS
- Submission/platform: IEEE IROS allows a supplementary video; camera-ready often requires a presentation or teaser video. Follow the year’s “Instructions on Authors’ Presentation Materials” and video notes for formats, durations, and file naming conventions [2].
- Video format guidance: Expect MP4/H.264, landscape 16:9, captions/subtitles, and size limits; teaser/presentation specs are detailed on the IROS site each year. Validate audio levels, font sizes, and avoid institution branding during review [2].
- Artifacts: Provide code/sim configs and a README that maps experiments to the video segments. If using real robots, include a short safety log excerpt (e.g., E‑stop activations, watchdog triggers) in the supplement [2].

CoRL
- Submission/platform: CoRL uses OpenReview; supplementary includes videos and anonymized artifacts. Code release is strongly encouraged; reviewers often run code [3].
- Video format guidance: MP4 with clear overlays and captions; keep it short (2–5 min) and directly tied to evaluation protocols. Do not include identifying lab spaces or logos during review [3][4].
- Artifacts: An anonymized repo with sim and evaluation scripts; small models/checkpoints; deterministic seeds; minimal datasets or data-download scripts. Include a statement of hardware requirements and sim-to-real gaps [3].

IEEE RA-L (journal) + conference option (e.g., ICRA/IROS)
- Submission/platform: RA-L supports multimedia components. See IEEE RAS video guidelines for encoding, resolution, audio, and captioning standards [4][6].
- Video format guidance: MP4/H.264, AAC audio, recommended resolution (e.g., 1080p), readable text at safe margins, and closed captions. Include a descriptive slate (paper title, figure callouts) and credits post‑acceptance only [4].
- Artifacts: Journal-grade artifact expectations—code, CAD/URDF, simulation assets, and data where permissible. Provide a detailed “Multimedia Materials” README and ensure ethical approval identifiers are present in the final (not blind) version [6].

ACM/IEEE HRI
- Submission/platform: HRI full papers require strong ethics reporting; videos are common to demonstrate interactions. Check HRI full paper guidance for current limits and anonymization expectations [5].
- Video format guidance: MP4 with captions; blur faces and identifying backgrounds; mask voices if needed. Include consent notes in the paper and avoid any participant-identifying content in the video during review [5].
- Artifacts: Consent scripts, task protocols, and coding schemes in anonymized appendices; code/sim optional but encouraged. Provide de-identified transcripts or annotated templates rather than raw human data [5].

Note on ICRA: No sources found for ICRA 2025 video requirements in this search; please verify the year’s Author/Submission instructions on the official IEEE RAS/ICRA site for exact video duration and format. If you need, I can incorporate ICRA specifics once you share the link. Conjecture: ICRA typically allows a supplementary video at submission and often requests a short preview/teaser at camera-ready.

Cross-venue supplemental video checklist (robotics safety)
- Technical
  - MP4 (H.264), 16:9, ≥720p (1080p recommended), legible ≥24 pt overlays, captions/subtitles, normalized audio levels [2][4].
  - Include a 2–5 second title slate (anonymized for blind review), and per-scene labels tied to experiments in the paper [2][4].
- Content
  - Show safety mechanisms: E‑stop location/use, watchdogs, emergency behaviors, geofencing, speed/power limits in effect.
  - Failure modes: at least one controlled failure or near‑miss with narrated mitigation.
  - Evaluation fidelity: clip per benchmark task with the same parameters used in the paper; onscreen seeds/config IDs where possible.
- Compliance/anonymity
  - No lab logos/banners, badges, or identifiable people; blur faces and background signage; strip EXIF metadata.
  - If HRI: explicit participant consent for recording; avoid unique quotes/identities; include a brief on-screen statement “participants consented; de‑identified” only post‑acceptance [5].
- Packaging
  - File <200 MB unless the venue permits larger; include a short caption file (.srt) and a PDF storyboard linking timestamps to figure numbers.
  - Test playback on multiple players and platforms; verify no proprietary codecs.

Artifact checklist (what to include in the supplement/repo)
- Code and configuration
  - Simulation world files, robot models (URDF/SDF), controllers, safety interlocks (software E‑stop), and evaluation scripts.
  - Determinism: seeds, fixed randomization, version pins; Docker/Conda; hardware abstraction notes.
- Hardware documentation
  - Bill of materials, safety-rated components (E‑stop, relays), max force/speed settings, and risk controls; wiring diagrams if relevant.
- Data and logs
  - Evaluation logs (success/fail counts, near-misses, E‑stop events, watchdog triggers), telemetry (pose, torque, currents), and error traces.
  - Datasets (or scripts to obtain) with licenses; do not redistribute restricted data; include a data ledger.
- Metrics and protocols
  - Safety metrics: hazard rate proxies, intervention rate, minimum distance margins, energy/force thresholds; calibration methods.
  - Benchmark definitions, stop conditions, human-in-the-loop procedures, and recovery policies.
- Documentation
  - Reproduction guide: “one-command” run for 1–2 core experiments in sim; expected vs obtained outputs table.
  - Known limitations and unsafe configurations; default configs set to safe mode.
- Anonymization
  - Remove author metadata, institution names, and footage with identifiable people for review packages; provide credited versions post‑acceptance.

Ethical review steps (robotics safety and HRI)
- Pre-study approvals
  - Human participants: secure IRB/ethics approval or exemption; consent scripts include physical risk disclosure and withdrawal rights. For HRI, add de-identification plan and small-cell suppression in reporting [5].
  - Lab/field safety: internal safety review or equivalent (risk assessment per ISO‑style hazard analysis), emergency procedures, and supervisor sign-off. If using public spaces/animals/special populations, obtain additional permits/approvals.
- During study
  - Safety controls: hardware E‑stop verified before each run; max speed/force limits enforced; operator training documented.
  - Incident logging: near-miss/incident form; immediate halt/inspection protocol; participant debrief if applicable.
- Reporting in paper and supplement
  - Ethical statement: approvals (board names/IDs in camera-ready), consent, risk mitigations, data handling, and access controls for any human data.
  - Residual risk discussion: known failure modes, mitigations, and deployment caveats.
  - For privacy: video blurring, audio redaction, storage retention limits, and access governance.
- Post-acceptance
  - Release de-identified data/video; provide credited versions; publish full safety documentation and a responsible use disclaimer.

Six-week timeline to submission
- Week 1: Protocol and compliance freeze
  - Finalize experiments, safety metrics, and datasets; identify target venue(s).
  - Start IRB/ethics and internal safety approvals; draft ethics statement; compile data/license ledger.
- Week 2: Artifact spine + first video cut
  - Build anonymized repo with sim/eval scripts; pin environments.
  - Record initial video clips; ensure anonymity; storyboard mapping clips to paper figures.
- Week 3: Complete core experiments and logs
  - Run full evaluation with 3 seeds; collect safety logs and telemetry.
  - Update video with failure cases and safety demonstrations; add captions.
- Week 4: Writing + artifact hardening
  - Draft paper, ethics section, and supplemental appendices (protocols, BOM, logs).
  - Add Docker/Conda, seeds, expected-vs-obtained table; run a clean-machine test.
- Week 5: External dry-run and polish
  - Colleague reproduces 1–2 experiments; fix nondeterminism; finalize video encoding.
  - Double-blind scrub of paper, video, and repo; check all links in incognito.
- Week 6: Final compliance and submission
  - Validate video against venue specs; verify file sizes, captions, and naming.
  - Complete venue checklists (ethics/reproducibility); archive artifact (anonymous link).
  - Submit ≥48 hours before the deadline; keep a 24–48 hour buffer for hotfixes.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Non-anonymized environments in video (logos, voices) during review—blur/mask and strip metadata [5].
- Missing seeds/env pins—prevent reproducibility failures across platforms (containerize).
- Redistributing restricted datasets—ship scripts and a ledger instead.
- Omitting safety failures—include at least one controlled failure and document mitigations.
