Below is a concise, conference-ready slide outline you can adapt. It emphasizes contributions, limitations, and concrete future work, and includes three falsifiable experiments with metrics.

Slide 1 — Title and Problem Statement
- Title, authors, affiliations
- One-liner: A principled, multi-axis framework for trustworthy LLM evaluation across factuality, robustness, uncertainty calibration, and safety
- Why this matters: Reliability gaps (hallucinations, vulnerability to adversarial prompts, miscalibration, harms) can degrade real-world utility

Slide 2 — Key Contributions
- Unified evaluation protocol spanning four pillars: factuality, robustness (OOD/adversarial), uncertainty calibration, and safety
- Measurement validity built-in: threats-to-validity checklist, inter-annotator agreement, power analysis, and preregistration-ready reporting templates
- Cost- and compute-normalized reporting to enable fair comparisons across model families
- Reproducibility kit: data splits, prompts, seeds, and scripts; model-agnostic design for closed/open models
- Optional: Incorporation of distributional correctness to capture belief over answers, not just pointwise accuracy [P2]

Slide 3 — Evaluation Design Overview
- Task suite: knowledge QA, reasoning, retrieval-grounded QA, instruction following, safety-sensitive tasks
- Protocols: standard prompts + adversarial/jailbreak variants; OOD shifts; perturbation-based robustness tests
- Human+automatic adjudication: claim-level and span-level factuality; toxicity/refusal scoring; triage/abstention evaluation

Slide 4 — Factuality and Hallucination Metrics
- Claim-level verification with evidence linking; localizing unsupported content
- Answer-level correctness with ambiguity handling; multi-reference where applicable
- Distributional correctness to assess whether the model’s belief distribution covers the truth set [P2]

Slide 5 — Robustness
- OOD generalization: time-split, domain-shift, paraphrase/format-shift
- Adversarial prompting: jailbreaks, goal misdirection, instruction conflicts; attack success rate and degradation curves
- Perturbation tests: noise, context shuffling, distractors

Slide 6 — Uncertainty and Calibration
- Eliciting calibrated probabilities or verbalized confidence; abstention/triage
- Metrics: Brier score, NLL, ECE; risk–coverage and selective prediction curves
- Decision-centric evaluation: utility under abstention thresholds

Slide 7 — Safety and Harms
- Taxonomy: toxicity, misinformation, privacy leakage, dangerous instructions
- Red-teaming coverage; refusal quality vs over-refusal trade-offs
- Metrics: ASR (attack success rate), refusal validity, harmlessness/helpfulness balance

Slide 8 — Measurement Validity and Reporting
- Threats to validity: construct/internal/external/conclusion
- Inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Cohen’s κ) and adjudication protocol
- Statistical tests and power; multiple-comparison controls
- Transparent reporting: prompts, seeds, compute/cost, model versions

Slide 9 — Results Snapshot (Tailor to your findings)
- Headline: trade-offs among factuality, robustness, calibration, and safety
- Pareto frontiers: accuracy vs calibration vs safety refusal quality
- Cost-normalized performance comparisons

Slide 10 — Ablations and Analysis
- Prompt format, context length, chain-of-thought/tool-use toggles
- With/without retrieval grounding; evidence strength vs hallucination rate
- Impact of adversarial training or self-critique/debate strategies [P4]

Slide 11 — Limitations
- Benchmark coverage and domain/language bias; limited multimodality
- Annotation noise and adjudication scalability; evaluation cost
- Black-box constraints (rate limits, hidden updates); reproducibility under API drift
- Static tests vs evolving adversaries; possible prompt overfitting

Slide 12 — Future Work
- Multilingual and multimodal extensions; domain-specific safety (e.g., medical/legal)
- Dynamic adversarial evaluation pipelines and continuous benchmarking
- Deeper belief-state evaluation (distributional correctness at scale) [P2]
- Debate- or self-critique-driven evaluation to stress-test hallucinations [P4]
- User-centric reliability metrics tied to decision costs in real workflows

Slide 13 — Three Concrete, Falsifiable Experiments
- E1: Distributional correctness vs pointwise accuracy
  - Hypothesis: Distributional correctness correlates better with human judgments on ambiguous QA than pointwise accuracy [P2].
  - Setup: Curate ambiguous QA set with multiple acceptable answers; elicit model’s probability over candidates.
  - Metrics: Spearman/Pearson correlation with human Likert ratings; calibration (Brier/NLL) over candidate sets.
  - Expected outcome: Higher correlation and better calibration for distributional correctness than pointwise metrics [P2].
- E2: Robustness to adversarial prompts with and without your protocol
  - Hypothesis: Models evaluated under your standardized adversarial protocol show lower attack success rate than under naive red-teaming.
  - Setup: Compare baseline adversarial prompts vs your curated attack set across tasks; measure success and degradation.
  - Metrics: Attack success rate, accuracy drop, refusal quality; statistical significance via McNemar/paired tests.
  - Expected outcome: Your protocol yields more reliable, lower-variance estimates and detects a higher fraction of failures at fixed budget.
- E3: Debate/self-critique reduces hallucination under adversarial distribution
  - Hypothesis: Multi-round debate or self-critique prior to final answer reduces hallucination rate relative to single-shot decoding [P4].
  - Setup: Evaluate on adversarial and OOD splits; compare one-shot vs two-round debate/self-critique.
  - Metrics: Hallucination rate (claim-level), factual F1, cost/latency overhead.
  - Expected outcome: Statistically significant reduction in hallucination rate with modest compute overhead [P4].

Slide 14 — Reproducibility and Artifacts
- Open-sourced prompts, splits, adjudication rubric, and scripts
- Versioned model identifiers; cost reporting; seeds and logs

Slide 15 — Takeaways and Q&A
- Summary: A practical, validity-aware framework that makes trustworthiness measurable and comparable
- Call to action: Integrate distributional correctness, adversarial protocols, and calibration-aware evaluation in future studies [P2], [P4]
