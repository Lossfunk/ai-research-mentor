I don't see any PDF attachments with your paper. To check for ethics and compliance risks, I'll need to review your manuscript.

**Please attach your paper (PDF or LaTeX), and I'll analyze:**

1. **Dataset licenses & citations** - Proper attribution, license compatibility, redistribution rights
2. **Human data handling** - IRB approval, consent, anonymization, demographic reporting
3. **Compute disclosures** - Carbon footprint, energy usage, hardware specifications, cost transparency
4. **Broader impacts** - Dual-use concerns, bias evaluation, failure mode analysis
5. **Reproducibility** - Code availability, hyperparameters, random seeds, model checkpoints
6. **Limitations section** - Required by most venues (ACL, NeurIPS, ICLR)
7. **Author statements** - Conflicts of interest, funding sources, author contributions

## In the Meantime: Common Compliance Risks for LLM Compression Papers

While you prepare your document, here are **frequent violations** I see in this area:

### 🔴 High-Risk Issues (Desk Reject Potential)

| Risk | Common Violation | Fix |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Dataset license violation** | Using C4, The Pile, or RedPajama without checking license restrictions | Verify each dataset component's license; cite original sources; avoid NC (non-commercial) data if submitting to commercial-affiliated venues |
| **Missing human subjects approval** | Evaluating on human-annotated data (e.g., TruthfulQA, BOLD) without IRB or exemption statement | Add IRB exemption statement for publicly available datasets; obtain approval for new annotations |
| **Compute non-disclosure** | Not reporting GPU hours, energy, or CO₂ estimates | Use ML CO₂ Impact calculator; report GPU type, hours, and estimated emissions in appendix |
| **Benchmark contamination** | Training/compressing on models that may have seen test sets | Explicitly state model training cutoff dates; use held-out benchmarks or temporal splits |

### 🟡 Medium-Risk Issues (Reviewer Flags)

| Risk | Common Violation | Fix |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Incomplete baseline citations** | Comparing to "BERT" without specifying checkpoint or citing original paper | Use full model names (e.g., `bert-base-uncased` from Hugging Face) with version hashes |
| **Missing limitations section** | No discussion of failure modes or scope boundaries | Add dedicated "Limitations" section (required by ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS) |
| **Bias evaluation gaps** | Compressing models without testing for amplified stereotypes | Run BOLD, WinoBias, or BBQ benchmarks; report demographic performance gaps |
| **Closed-source baselines** | Comparing to GPT-4 without access details or reproducibility caveats | Disclose API version, date accessed, and non-reproducibility limitations |

### 🟢 Low-Risk Issues (Polish)

| Risk | Common Violation | Fix |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Vague data splits** | "We use standard train/test splits" without specifics | Cite exact split (e.g., "validation set from Gao et al. 2021") |
| **Missing code release timeline** | "Code will be released" without commitment | State "upon acceptance" or provide anonymous GitHub link for review |
| **Hyperparameter under-specification** | Not reporting learning rates, batch sizes, or random seeds | Add full hyperparameter table in appendix; include seeds for <5 runs |

## Venue-Specific Checklists

### NeurIPS 2024/2025
- [ ] Ethics impact statement (mandatory, separate section)
- [ ] Checklist covering: datasets, code, compute, broader impacts, theory/proofs
- [ ] Limitations and societal impact discussion
- [ ] Reproducibility: hyperparameters, seeds, statistical significance tests
- [ ] Funding disclosure

### ACL/EMNLP 2024/2025
- [ ] Mandatory "Limitations" section (unnumbered, before references)
- [ ] Ethics statement if using human data or dual-use potential
- [ ] Responsible NLP checklist (covers A1-A14, B1-B7)
- [ ] Computational budget in appendix
- [ ] License for released artifacts

### ICLR 2025
- [ ] Reproducibility statement (code, data, hyperparameters)
- [ ] Ethics review trigger check (human subjects, dual-use, environmental impact)
- [ ] Broader impact discussion (can be in appendix)
- [ ] Conflict of interest disclosure

## Specific Fixes for LLM Compression Papers

### Dataset License Audit Template

```markdown
## Data Statement (Appendix)

| Dataset | License | Usage | Citation |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| C4 | ODC-BY | Perplexity eval | Raffel et al. 2020 |
| GLUE | CC-BY-SA | Downstream tasks | Wang et al. 2018 |
| LLaMA weights | Custom (research-only) | Base model | Touvron et al. 2023 |

**Compliance notes**: 
- C4 derived from Common Crawl (ODC-BY); no redistribution of raw data
- LLaMA weights used under Meta research license; compressed checkpoints not redistributed
- All human-annotated datasets (SST-2, MNLI) use publicly available versions with original consent
```

### Compute Disclosure Template

```markdown
## Computational Resources (Appendix)

**Compression experiments**: 
- Hardware: 4× NVIDIA A100 (40GB)
- Total GPU hours: ~120 hours
- Estimated CO₂: ~15 kg (using ML CO₂ calculator, US grid average)
- Cloud cost: ~$480 (AWS p4d.24xlarge pricing)

**Baseline reproductions**:
- Used published checkpoints where available
- Re-ran [specific baseline] on same hardware for fair comparison
```

### Human Data Template (if applicable)

```markdown
## Human Subjects Statement

This research uses publicly available datasets with existing human annotations:
- **IRB status**: Exempt (publicly available data, no new collection)
- **Consent**: Original datasets obtained informed consent (see [citations])
- **Anonymization**: All datasets pre-anonymized by original authors
- **Demographic reporting**: We report performance across gender/dialect subgroups using BOLD benchmark
```

## Action Items

**Upload your paper** and I'll provide:
1. ✅ Line-by-line compliance check with page/section references
2. 🔧 Specific text edits for missing statements
3. ⚠️ Risk-ranked issue list (desk-reject → minor polish)
4. 📋 Venue-specific checklist completion status
5. 🔗 Links to license files, IRB templates, and CO₂ calculators

**What format is your paper in?** (PDF, LaTeX source, Overleaf link) I can work with any of these.
