I don’t have your manuscript yet. If you can share the PDF or paste your Ethics/Data/Appendix sections (esp. dataset table, human evaluation details, compute/training setup), I can do a line-by-line risk pass. Meanwhile, here’s a focused audit checklist with concrete fixes and drop‑in text you can add to your paper. It’s aligned to typical NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/ACL requirements.

What to check and how to fix it

A) Dataset licenses and third‑party content
Common risks
- Missing or incorrect licenses for datasets, model checkpoints, or code.
- Mixing incompatible licenses (e.g., CC‑BY‑SA sources with non‑share‑alike artifacts).
- Using data under non‑commercial/“research only” terms while releasing broadly usable weights.
- Terms-of-service violations (scraping, rehosting), missing attribution, or redistribution of restricted artifacts.
- Training on data with personal/sensitive content without documenting safeguards or legal basis.

Fixes
- Add a dataset ledger (appendix table) with: name, version/date, URL/DOI, license identifier (SPDX or canonical link), usage restrictions, whether you redistribute any portion, and required attribution text/links.
- Verify license compatibility. If any source is NC/SA or has TOS limits:
  - Do not redistribute raw data; gate model weights under a matching use license or exclude that subset and retrain/finetune.
  - Provide a “data procurement script” that re-downloads from the original source instead of bundling copies.
- Add mandatory attributions in the paper and repository (NOTICE/CITATION files).
- For web-scraped or aggregator datasets, state robots.txt/TOS compliance and cite the dataset creators’ license; do not claim a license that the dataset does not grant.
- For any potentially personal/sensitive data, either remove/filter it, or document a legal basis, minimization, and de-identification.

Drop-in text for paper
- Data licensing: “All datasets used are listed in Appendix X with license IDs and links. We do not redistribute any third‑party data. Where licenses require attribution, we include the required statements in Appendix X and our repository’s NOTICE file. Sources with non‑commercial or share‑alike terms were excluded from the training set for the released model weights.”
- Redistribution: “Weights are licensed under [license]. They were trained only on datasets whose licenses permit such redistribution. We do not include any datasets or code with non‑commercial or share‑alike restrictions.”
- TOS compliance: “Data collection complied with source Terms of Service and robots.txt directives. We distribute only scripts to reproduce data curation from original sources.”

B) Human data and human evaluation (IRB/ethics)
Common risks
- No IRB/ethics review or waiver when collecting new human data or running annotator studies.
- Missing informed consent, demographics, pay/fairness details, or task instructions.
- Handling potentially sensitive attributes without justification, minimization, or safeguards.
- Releasing raw human data without consent or adequate de-identification.

Fixes
- Obtain IRB/ethics approval or a documented exemption. Include protocol ID, board name, and determination.
- Provide an Annotator/Participant Methods Appendix: recruitment, screening, training/instructions, qualification tests, payment (base + bonuses, effective hourly rate), demographics (optional/aggregate), consent language, opt‑out, and data retention policy.
- Exclude minors or obtain explicit parental consent and additional safeguards.
- De-identify any human data you share; if not shareable, publish aggregate statistics and a data access statement instead.
- Add safety metrics for LLM evaluations (toxicity, bias) and note whether compression changes these.

Drop-in text for paper
- Ethics/IRB: “Our human evaluation protocol was reviewed by [IRB/ethics board], protocol #[ID], and determined [approved/exempt, category X]. Participants provided informed consent and could withdraw at any time.”
- Compensation: “Annotators were compensated at a target rate of ≥$[X]/hr (median realized $[Y]/hr).”
- Data handling: “We collect no directly identifying information; any free‑text was screened for PII and de-identified before analysis. Raw human responses will not be publicly released; we provide aggregate metrics and task templates.”

C) Compute and environmental disclosures
Common risks
- Vague or incomplete hardware/compute reporting; no seeds/configs; carbon/emissions omitted.
- Reproducibility gaps: unspecified software versions, kernels, quantization backends, or KV‑cache settings that materially affect efficiency.

Fixes
- Add a Reproducibility/Compute Appendix with:
  - Hardware: accelerators (model, memory), CPU, interconnect, storage, cluster topology; count of devices; region/data center if reporting emissions.
  - Software: framework + versions, CUDA/cuDNN/compilers, quantization/export toolchains, inference kernels/backends, precision settings, context length, KV‑cache policy.
  - Training/eval: batch sizes, sequence lengths, tokens processed, epochs/steps, gradient accumulation, optimizer, LR schedule, data filtering, checkpoint selection.
  - Compute: total device‑hours, average wall‑power per device or TDP assumption, PUE, estimated energy (kWh) and carbon (kgCO2e). Provide formula and assumptions.
  - Randomness: all seeds and determinism flags; any nondeterministic ops noted.
- Release scripts/configs to reproduce experiments; pin versions and publish commit hashes and checkpoints.

Drop-in text for paper
- Compute: “Training used [N]×[GPU model] for [H] device‑hours. Average device power draw was [W]W (measured/assumed TDP), PUE=[p]. Estimated energy use was [E]=N×H×W/1000×PUE kWh and carbon [C]=E×[grid kgCO2e/kWh] kgCO2e.”
- Reproducibility: “We release code, exact configs, random seeds, and checkpoints at [URL]. Experiments specify kernels/backends (e.g., TensorRT‑LLM vX.Y, bitsandbytes vZ).”

D) LLM‑specific compression risks to acknowledge
- Distributional shift in safety due to quantization/pruning (toxicity, stereotype bias, hallucination rates) and long‑context degradation.
Fixes
- Include before/after safety metrics (e.g., toxicity, bias benchmarks) and long‑context checks; document any regressions and mitigations.
Drop-in text: “We evaluate safety and fairness impacts pre/post‑compression on [metrics/datasets]. We observe [Δ]; mitigations include [calibration/distillation/safety filters].”

E) Paper/repo hygiene reviewers check
- Add a Responsible Research Checklist (or venue‑specific ethics/reproducibility checklist).
- Include model and data cards in the repo; add license files (LICENSE, NOTICE), and third‑party attributions.
- Provide a clear data availability statement and usage restrictions.

Minimal pre‑submission self‑audit (yes/no)
- Do you have a dataset ledger with licenses/URLs/versions and required attributions, and is it in the paper?
- Are any sources NC/SA or TOS‑restricted? If yes, are they excluded or are weights licensed compatibly?
- If you collected human data: IRB/ethics approval or exemption? Consent obtained? Pay documented? PII handled? Data sharing plan clear?
- Compute: exact hardware counts, device‑hours, seeds, versions, and emission estimates included?
- Safety: pre/post‑compression safety metrics reported?
- Repo: code/configs/checkpoints released with licenses and third‑party notices?

If you share the manuscript, I will mark specific sentences that need changes and provide venue‑specific wording (NeurIPS/ICLR/ARR).
