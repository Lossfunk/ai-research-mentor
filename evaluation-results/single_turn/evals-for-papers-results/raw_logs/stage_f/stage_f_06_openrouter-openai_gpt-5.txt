Below is a concise, copy-ready set of double‑blind compliance notes you can adapt for your human‑centered AI evaluation paper, plus an artifact release plan and anonymized appendix outline. I’ve also included a short pitfall checklist. Confirm venue‑specific details against the linked policies before submission.

A) Double‑blind compliance notes (drop‑in language for your paper)
- Anonymity and referencing
  - “This submission follows double‑blind policies. We avoid self‑identifying text and citations; where prior work by the authors is necessary, we cite it in the third person without revealing authorship. We do not link to non‑anonymized repositories or websites in the submission. Any code/data artifacts are provided via anonymized links or as supplementary files appropriate to the venue’s policy.” [NeurIPS CFP; ICML Author Instructions; ICLR Author Guide; ARR Anonymity; CHI Anonymization]
- Human subjects and sensitive materials
  - “To preserve participant privacy during review, we (i) removed direct identifiers, (ii) paraphrased or lightly masked quotes that could enable re‑identification, and (iii) blurred faces/redacted names in any media. We report only aggregate statistics; small‑cell counts are suppressed or pooled. All raw data containing PII are withheld from the submission package but can be accessed post‑acceptance under an approved data‑use agreement.” [CHI Anonymization; ARR Checklist]
- Supplementary and prior dissemination
  - “Supplementary materials are anonymized (no author names, affiliations, or metadata). Preprints or prior talks are not referenced in a way that reveals identity; we avoid linking to non‑anonymous preprints from the submission.” [ICLR/OpenReview; ICML FAQ; ARR Anonymity]

B) Artifact release plan (for the paper and README)
- What we provide at submission (anonymized)
  - Code: Minimal runnable code for core analyses/evaluations with pinned environment (Docker/Conda), seeds, and instructions. Repository hosted on an anonymous platform (e.g., OpenReview attachment, anonymous Git hosting, or OSF/Zenodo anonymous link). Git history squashed; commit metadata scrubbed. No personal or institutional identifiers in files or model cards. [NeurIPS Code Submission Policy; OpenReview guidance]
  - Data: No raw human‑subject data. We include (a) scripts to fetch public datasets where licenses permit and (b) a small, synthetic or de‑identified exemplar to illustrate structure and preprocessing. A Data Access Statement explains how to request the full dataset post‑acceptance under privacy safeguards (e.g., DUA/IRB). [ARR Checklist; CHI Anonymization]
  - Measures/instruments: Task templates, annotation guidelines, interview protocols, and survey instruments in an anonymized appendix; any location‑specific context is generalized to avoid deanonymization.
- What we release post‑acceptance (de‑anonymized)
  - Code and documentation under an appropriate license, with versioned DOI (e.g., Zenodo).
  - Data: Aggregates, de‑identified excerpts approved by IRB, and a formal access process for restricted data (contact point, review steps, and conditions of use).
  - Registered artifact (if venue offers AE): A containerized artifact with step‑by‑step scripts and expected outputs. [Artifact Evaluation calls]

Suggested paper text
- “Artifacts. An anonymized code package reproducing the core analyses is provided in the supplementary materials/anonymous link. It includes environment files, scripts, and seed configurations sufficient to reproduce Tables X–Y. Human‑subject data are not shared during review; we provide synthetic exemplars and all preprocessing code. Upon acceptance, we will release the full artifact (code, documentation, and de‑identified data where permitted) with a permanent DOI and a data‑access process for restricted materials.”

C) Anonymized appendices (structure and content to include)
- Appendix A: Human‑subjects methods (anonymized)
  - Recruitment and inclusion criteria (without site or PI names); consent process; compensation policy (ranges, effective hourly rates); task instructions; risk mitigation steps (e.g., content warnings, opt‑out).
  - IRB/ethics status: “The study received ethics approval/exemption from an institutional review board (details withheld to preserve anonymity). The protocol ID and board name will be provided upon acceptance.” [ARR Checklist; CHI Anonymization]
- Appendix B: Instruments and prompts (anonymized)
  - Full survey/interview guides, annotation rubrics, and evaluation prompts. Remove org‑specific branding and identifiers; paraphrase any real‑world names in example items.
- Appendix C: Data processing and privacy safeguards
  - Pseudonymization, de‑identification pipelines (fields removed/masked), storage and access controls, small‑cell suppression rules, and aggregation thresholds.
- Appendix D: Reproducibility bundle (anonymized)
  - Environment specification (requirements.txt/conda.yaml and Dockerfile), entry‑point commands for 1–2 core results, seed values, and expected outputs. Note any components withheld for privacy and provide stubs/synthetic replacements.
- Appendix E: Limitations and risk statement
  - Known privacy risks (e.g., re‑identification risk in rare subgroups), mitigations adopted, and residual uncertainties.

D) Double‑blind hygiene checklist (pre‑submission)
- PDF and media metadata stripped (author, institution, EXIF on images/video).
- Self‑references written in third person; no “we previously” language that discloses identity.
- No non‑anonymous links (personal sites, lab GitHub, Google Drive with owner info). Test artifact links in a private/incognito session.
- Institution names, grant numbers, IRB IDs omitted from the submission; deferred to camera‑ready.
- Location and dates that would reveal study site generalized (e.g., “a large North American university”).
- Quotes and qualitative excerpts checked for uniquely identifying content; paraphrased or masked as needed.
- All supplementary files and README are anonymized; LICENSE and NOTICE files do not include identifying headers during review.
- For OpenReview venues: author identities are not revealed in discussion; public comments avoid self‑identification. [OpenReview guidance]
- For ARR/ACL: Responsible NLP Research Checklist included; any constraints on data sharing clearly justified without naming the institution. [ARR Checklist]

E) Data access and privacy notes (copy‑ready)
- Data availability (review stage): “Due to human‑subject privacy constraints, raw data are not available during review. We provide (i) de‑identified aggregates and (ii) scripts to reproduce preprocessing and analyses. Synthetic exemplars illustrate dataset structure without exposing PII.”
- Post‑accept access: “Subject to ethics approval and a data‑use agreement, de‑identified data may be granted to qualified researchers. Requests will be evaluated for risk of re‑identification and purpose compatibility; we will provide a formal application process upon acceptance.”

F) Common pitfalls and how we mitigated them
- Linking to non‑anonymous repos: Use anonymous hosting or upload artifacts as supplementary files; avoid account‑identifying metadata. [NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR policies]
- Deanonymization via site‑specific details: Replace institution/clinic/company names with neutral descriptors; postpone precise location to camera‑ready.
- Qualitative data leaks: Remove names/locations; paraphrase rare events; aggregate demographics; suppress cells with n<5 in tables.
- Media leaks: Blur faces and identifying backgrounds; strip audio of names; remove EXIF/location metadata. 
- “Hidden” identifiers: Scrub notebooks, config files, and model cards for author names, file paths, or cloud bucket URIs.

If you share your target venue (e.g., CHI vs. NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/ACL), I can convert the above into a one‑page, venue‑specific preflight checklist with the exact fields (e.g., ARR ethics checklist items, NeurIPS reproducibility checklist, OpenReview artifact link format).
