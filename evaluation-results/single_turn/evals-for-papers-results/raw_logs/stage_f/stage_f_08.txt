Below is a pragmatic, venue-specific submission plan for a robotics safety paper, with what to prepare for supplemental videos, artifact/reproducibility checklists, and ethics/IRB/dual‑use review. Where official venue guidance is available, I link and cite it directly; where venues are silent or vary year‑to‑year, I give conservative, widely accepted defaults and note to verify against the current CFP/instructions.

Quick venue routing
- ICRA/IROS: Best for general robotics safety methods validated in hardware or credible simulation, with video strongly encouraged and standard IEEE formatting. Check each year’s instructions for video/ethics notes. [1][2][4][5][6]
- RSS: Top-tier single-track robotics conference; supplemental material allowed; strong emphasis on clarity and empirical rigor. [7][8]
- CoRL: Robotics + ML; typically requires a reproducibility checklist and encourages artifact sharing; careful about claims and safety/ethics disclosures. [9][10]
- RA‑L (journal, often with ICRA/IROS option): Favors concise results with optional multimedia; follow RAS/IEEE video guidelines and RA‑L final checklist. [11][12][13]
- IJRR (journal): Strong empirical and methodological rigor; SAGE policies on data and materials availability apply. [14]
- Science Robotics (journal): Highest bar for novelty/impact; very strong data/materials/video policies and explicit ethics expectations. [15][16]

Venue-specific plan

ICRA (IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation)
- Supplemental video
  - Prepare per ICRA’s “Contributions: Video Submissions” (format, length, upload mechanics). This page changes annually—use the current year’s video page. [4]
  - Align with IEEE RAS video guidelines for encoding and accessibility (e.g., MP4/H.264, clear narration/captions). [13]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - ICRA itself does not mandate a formal artifact evaluation, but sharing code, data, and experiment configs as supplementary is encouraged; ensure anonymization at submission. Crosslink in the video and paper. (Check the current final submission instructions for any addenda.) [2]
- Ethics
  - Include an ethics/safety statement covering human/animal use, risk mitigations, and dual-use considerations; adhere to institutional approvals (IRB/IACUC) and disclose in the paper. (IEEE doesn’t usually run a separate ethics board for ICRA; responsibility is on authors and TPC when relevant.) Use the final submission instructions to see if a statement is required that year. [2]

IROS (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)
- Supplemental video
  - Follow the IROS CFP and final submission pages for video requirements and deadlines; IROS tends to specify video length/format per year. [5][6]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - Share code/data/supplementary appendices as allowed in final submission; check the year’s final submission page for any reproducibility checklist or artifact pointers. [6]
- Ethics
  - IROS 2025 CFP explicitly calls out video submission and AI ethics; include an ethics statement covering societal impact, safety, and misuse risks; reference any approvals (IRB/IACUC) and consent procedures. [5]

RSS (Robotics: Science and Systems)
- Supplemental video
  - RSS allows supplementary material; include a concise video demonstrating safety-critical behaviors and failure cases. Confirm the current author info page each year for specifics. [7]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - Provide a thorough supplement with environment seeds, logs, and re-run instructions; reviewers will weigh clarity and reproducibility in the review. [7][8]
- Ethics
  - Include an ethics/safety/dual-use statement; reviewers and ACs consider appropriateness and disclosure quality. [8]

CoRL (Conference on Robot Learning)
- Supplemental video
  - CoRL accepts supplementary materials (video, appendices). Use the author instructions/CfP for the current year’s limits. [9][10]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - CoRL typically requires a reproducibility checklist (derived from ML venues) and strongly encourages code/data release. Prepare a clean repo and a filled reproducibility checklist at submission. [9][10]
- Ethics
  - Include an ethics statement if your work involves human/animal subjects, significant safety risk, or sensitive data; follow institutional approvals and be explicit about dual-use considerations. [9][10]

RA‑L (IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters)
- Supplemental video
  - RA‑L permits multimedia supplements; adhere to IEEE RAS video guidelines for encoding and accessibility. [11][12][13]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - Follow RA‑L’s final submission checklist and procedures; include data/code availability statements and links where possible. [11][12]
- Ethics
  - Disclose IRB/IACUC approvals and safety mitigations; ensure the manuscript includes ethical compliance statements, per IEEE/RA‑L policy. [11]

IJRR (The International Journal of Robotics Research)
- Supplemental video
  - IJRR accepts supplementary material; upload videos as per SAGE/IJRR instructions. [14]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - Provide a data/materials availability statement and links to code/data consistent with SAGE policies. [14]
- Ethics
  - Include statements on human/animal ethics approvals, informed consent, safety protocols, and data privacy; IJRR follows SAGE ethics standards. [14]

Science Robotics (AAAS)
- Supplemental video
  - Science Robotics encourages videos as supplementary materials for research articles; follow the specific formatting and submission instructions. [15][16]
- Artifacts/reproducibility
  - Strong data/code/materials availability expectations; prepare a detailed availability statement and provide stable links (e.g., DOI’d repositories). [15][16]
- Ethics
  - Explicit ethics requirements: describe approvals (IRB/IACUC), consent, data privacy, safety protocols, and dual-use. Editors scrutinize these closely. [15][16]

Cross-venue supplemental video checklist (build once and adapt)
- Content: task setup, failure modes, safety-critical edge cases, ablations, real-time overlays of safety metrics (e.g., constraint residuals, safety violation counters). Avoid identifiable faces/logos unless consented; anonymize as needed for double-blind review.
- Technical: MP4 (H.264), clear audio or captions, legible text at 1080p, landscape 16:9, steady camera, stable white balance. Keep duration within the venue’s stated limit and file size under the portal limits; verify in the current year’s instructions. [4][13][5]
- Integrity: show uncut segments for safety-critical events; timestamp overlays; cite firmware/hardware versions. Include a final slide with a link/QR to artifacts (staged for anonymized access pre‑publication).
- Compliance: ensure no music or copyrighted material; include accessibility captions. [13]

Cross-venue artifact and reproducibility package checklist (minimum viable)
- Readme: one-command run to reproduce main plots/tables; list OS, dependencies, and exact commit hash.
- Configs/seeds: all training/eval configs, random seeds, and hyperparameters; document any safety thresholds or controller gains.
- Data: logs for safety events (violations, near misses, interventions), environment assets, and calibration files (or synthetic equivalents if proprietary).
- Hardware: robot model/firmware versions, sensor models, payloads, safety interlocks; power and communication layouts.
- Evaluation: scripts to recompute metrics from raw logs; unit tests for metrics.
- Provenance: training compute (GPU hours, energy if available), simulator versions, domain randomization settings (if used).
- Licenses: code/data licensing, third-party acknowledgments.
- Ethics/safety: IRB/IACUC approval IDs (if applicable), de-identification notes, risk mitigations.
- For CoRL and journals: complete the venue’s reproducibility checklist and include a permanent artifact link (e.g., Zenodo DOI). [9][10][11][14][15]

Ethical review steps (what to do before submission)
- Human subjects: obtain IRB approval (or exemption) for any participant data, bystander capture, or operator study; document informed consent and privacy protections in the paper and supplement. State the approval ID.
- Animal research: obtain IACUC approval and document welfare protocols.
- Safety and risk: perform a formal hazard analysis (e.g., HAZOP/FMEA); document physical interlocks, emergency stops, supervision policies, and safe stop conditions. Include a safety incident log (even if zero incidents) and near-miss reporting procedure in the supplement.
- Dual-use and societal impact: describe foreseeable misuse/harm and mitigations (e.g., restricting high-risk capabilities in artifact release, staged disclosure, or redaction of dangerous details if justified). IROS and Science Robotics explicitly call for ethics/impact attention; align your statement accordingly. [5][15][16]
- Data governance: ensure licenses/consents for any third-party datasets; detail de-identification steps; follow the venue’s data availability policy (journals require explicit statements). [14][15]
- Environmental disclosure (optional but increasingly valued): report compute and energy use where material to the claims.

Lean timeline (relative to submission deadline)
- T−6 weeks: Lock paper scope; begin IRB/IACUC and hazard analysis; outline ethics statement; draft video storyboard.
- T−5 weeks: Freeze experiment protocols; start artifact repo with run scripts; film preliminary clips for critical scenarios.
- T−3 weeks: Complete ablations; record final video; run reproducibility dry-run on a clean machine; prepare data/code availability statements.
- T−1 week: Final ethics/dual-use review; anonymize artifacts; verify portal constraints (video length/size, supplementary limits) per venue pages; fill reproducibility checklist (CoRL; journal submissions). [9][10][11][14][15]

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments to strengthen a robotics safety paper
- Safety-layer ablation: Hypothesis: adding a control-barrier-function (CBF) safety layer reduces safety violations without reducing task success beyond 5%. Protocol: compare Controller vs Controller+CBF across 10 randomized seeds in sim and 5 real trials; Metrics: violation rate, minimum distance to hazards, task success, intervention count; Expected outcome: ≥50% reduction in violations, ≤5% drop in success. Literature anchor: control barrier functions in safety-critical control.
- Constraint‑aware RL vs constrained baseline: Hypothesis: a constrained RL method (e.g., CPO/CBF‑RL) achieves lower cumulative safety cost than an unconstrained RL baseline at matched success rate. Protocol: evaluate on two standard safety tasks (sim) and one real‑robot proxy; Metrics: success, cumulative constraint cost, recovery time after near‑miss, generalization to unseen hazard placements; Expected outcome: significantly lower safety cost (p<0.05) at equal success. Literature anchor: constrained policy optimization and safe RL benchmarks.
- Fault‑injection robustness: Hypothesis: the proposed safety monitor caps hazard exposure under actuator latency and sensor dropout faults. Protocol: inject 100–300 ms actuation delay and 10–20% packet loss in sim HIL; run 30 trials per condition; Metrics: time-in-unsafe-set, number of emergency stops, recovery success; Expected outcome: bounded unsafe time (<1 s per event) and ≥90% recovery.

Key takeaways
- Start early on ethics approvals and hazard analysis—journals and some conferences actively check for this; Science Robotics and IROS call it out explicitly. [5][15][16]
- Build a single, high-quality supplemental video and artifact package, then tailor to each venue’s portal constraints and naming/format rules. Check the current year’s venue pages for any updated size/format specifics. [4][5][6][9][11][14][15]
- For CoRL and journals, expect stricter reproducibility and availability statements; fill the checklist and host a stable artifact with DOIs. [9][10][11][14][15]
