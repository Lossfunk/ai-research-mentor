Here’s a compact, venue-agnostic final submission checklist tailored for a privacy‑preserving NLP paper, with concrete artifact requirements, ethics statement content, and week‑by‑week checkpoints for a 6‑week runway.

Final submission checklist (what has to be in the paper and repo)
- Problem and claims
  - Precisely define “privacy-preserving” (e.g., DP-SGD with (ε, δ); redaction; privacy filters), threat model(s) (membership inference, extraction, PII leakage), and success criteria.
  - Clearly separate utility claims (task metrics) from privacy claims (attack success/exposure).

- Methods reporting
  - Differential Privacy (if used): training regime (DP-SGD vs DP fine‑tune), clipping norm, noise multiplier, sampling rate, batch/microbatching, accountant type (RDP/Moments), and final (ε, δ) per component.
  - Non‑DP defenses (if used): data redaction/PII filtering, post‑hoc output filtering, aggregation, or partitioning; describe failure modes.

- Evaluation protocol
  - Utility: primary metrics with 95% CIs; seeds ≥3; target tasks/datasets, splits, deduplication.
  - Privacy/robustness: attacks and metrics (membership‑inference AUC/AP; canary exposure; PII leakage rate; nearest‑neighbor reidentification), and attack budgets/hyperparameters.

- Ethics, compliance, and risk disclosures (must be explicit in paper)
  - Data rights and licenses: dataset ledger with name, version/date, URL/DOI, license (SPDX/link), redistribution status, attribution text; TOS compliance.
  - Human data: IRB/ethics determination (approved/exempt ID), consent basis, minimization, de‑identification; data sharing plan (aggregates only if needed).
  - Privacy risks: residual leakage scenarios, groups affected, trade‑offs (utility vs ε), and mitigations (default safer configs, redaction).
  - Compute/environment: hardware counts, device‑hours, software versions, seeds; energy/emissions estimate and assumptions.
  - Limitations: what threats are not covered (e.g., data poisoning, prompt‑leak from prompts not in training).

- Artifacts (anonymized at submission; public at camera‑ready)
  - Code: training and evaluation (attacks included), config files, seeds, environment (Docker/conda), logging of ε accounting, and checks to prevent non‑DP paths.
  - Data: no raw mirrors; scripts to acquire/prepare from sources; de‑identification/PII filter code; clear licenses in LICENSE/NOTICE.
  - Models: checkpoints (DP and non‑DP baselines), model card with privacy budget, training data policy, known risks/uses, and allowed usage license.
  - Attack suite: ready‑to‑run scripts for membership inference, canary extraction (with sample canaries), PII leakage scanning, and nearest‑neighbor re‑ID.
  - Reproducibility: one‑command runner for 1–2 core experiments; expected outputs/metrics; CI log or “expected vs obtained” table.

- Paper hygiene
  - Template compliance, anonymization (including artifact links), ethics/reproducibility checklist filled, hyperlinks validated in incognito, all figures legible.
  - Summary “What to reproduce” box: exact command(s) and expected main numbers.

Artifact requirements (what reviewers expect to run)
- Privacy budget accounting
  - Script/API call that prints (ε, δ) with accountant choice; logs include clipping norm, noise multiplier, sampling rate, steps, and δ value.
- Attack implementations and configs
  - Membership inference (black‑box and, if applicable, white‑box); canary insertion and exposure computation; PII leak scanner with patterns/models; nearest‑neighbor search over training embeddings for reidentification.
- Safety/guardrails
  - Redaction/PII filters on training data; output‑time filters (documented and toggleable); evaluation of how filters affect utility.
- Reproducibility and integrity
  - Exact seeds; deterministic flags; version pins; hash of datasets and checkpoints; unit tests for DP path (e.g., gradient clipping/noise presence).
- Documentation
  - Model/data cards, dataset ledger, LICENSE/NOTICE with third‑party attributions, and a Release Policy stating gating (e.g., non‑prod research license if needed).

Ethics statement content (include these elements explicitly)
- Human subjects/IRB: board name and protocol ID; consent; de‑identification; data retention; access controls.
- Legal and licensing: lawful basis (e.g., consent/public interest), license compatibility; no redistribution of restricted data.
- Privacy threat models and scope: which attacks you test (membership, extraction, PII leakage), which you do not (e.g., side‑channel), and why.
- Residual risk and mitigations: expected residual leakage at reported ε; safeguards (filters, usage policy); instructions for safe deployment.
- Societal impact: potential harms from failure modes; equity considerations (e.g., uneven leakage across subgroups if measured).

Six-week timeline with checkpoints and “go/no‑go” gates
- Week 1: Protocol and compliance freeze
  - Finalize threat models, attack suites, target datasets; lock DP accounting method and (ε, δ) targets.
  - Complete dataset/license/TOS ledger; IRB/exemption on file if human data.
  - Gate: no datasets with incompatible licenses; ethics section skeleton drafted.

- Week 2: Artifact spine + baselines
  - Build anonymized repo; implement one‑command runs for (a) non‑DP baseline and (b) DP model at a mid ε.
  - Add ε logging, seeds, env pinning; membership inference baseline (black‑box).
  - Gate: clean run on fresh machine; baseline utility within expected range.

- Week 3: Privacy evals v1 + utility sweep
  - Run ε sweep (e.g., ε ∈ {∞ (non‑DP), 10, 8, 6, 4, 2}); log utility and compute.
  - Implement canary exposure and PII leakage scanner; run on dev subset.
  - Gate: attack scripts produce stable metrics; initial privacy‑utility curve plotted.

- Week 4: Robustness and ablations
  - White‑box MI (if applicable); nearest‑neighbor re‑ID; effect of data redaction and output filters on leakage and utility.
  - Add 3–5 seed repeats; calibration and CIs; finalize compute/emissions.
  - Gate: all attacks converge; figures/tables populated with CIs.

- Week 5: Writing + artifact hardening
  - Complete Methods (DP details), Ethics, and Results; finalize dataset ledger, model/data cards; fill venue checklists.
  - Harden artifact: documentation, unit tests for DP path, expected‑vs‑obtained table; validate anonymization of links.
  - Gate: external dry‑run replication (colleague) matches key numbers.

- Week 6: Final polish and contingency
  - Tighten figures; limitations and residual risks; proofreading; template compliance; link validation.
  - Archive artifact (anonymized) and generate permanent link; prepare post‑accept camera‑ready public release plan.
  - Submit ≥48 hours before deadline; keep 24–48 hours buffer for hotfixes.

Key experiments to substantiate privacy claims (concrete and falsifiable)
- E1: Privacy–utility trade‑off under DP-SGD
  - Setup: Fine‑tune the same model with ε ∈ {∞, 10, 6, 4, 2} (fixed δ, accountant, clipping); 3–5 seeds.
  - Hypothesis: As ε decreases, membership inference AUC approaches chance (≈0.5) while task metric drops monotonically; ε≤4 yields MI AUC ≤0.55 across tasks.
  - Falsification: If MI AUC >0.6 at ε≤4 or utility does not degrade monotonically, revise method or claims.

- E2: Memorization/canary exposure
  - Setup: Insert random unique canaries into training data (rate ≤10−5); measure exposure per Carlini et al. compared to non‑DP baseline.
  - Hypothesis: DP models reduce average canary exposure by ≥X (set X, e.g., 5 points) relative to non‑DP at matched utility.
  - Falsification: Comparable exposure to non‑DP contradicts privacy claims; requires method/parameter changes.

- E3: PII leakage and reidentification
  - Setup: Evaluate output PII leakage rate on a held‑out prompt set and nearest‑neighbor re‑ID of training sentences from embedding space.
  - Hypothesis: With DP + redaction, PII leakage rate is statistically indistinguishable from non‑trained baseline and re‑ID precision@k ≤ threshold T (define T).
  - Falsification: Elevated leakage or re‑ID precision prompts mitigations (stronger filters, higher noise, updated claims).

Risks and last‑mile fixes
- Risk: Incomplete DP reporting (no accountant/δ). Fix: Add ε logs, δ value, and accountant details; include code snippet in appendix.
- Risk: Weak or misconfigured attacks. Fix: Tune attacks (calibration, query budgets); report strongest observed attack.
- Risk: License/IRB gaps. Fix: Remove/replace restricted datasets; add IRB/exemption ID and de‑identification details.
- Risk: Anonymization leaks via repos. Fix: Use anonymous hosting; scrub commit metadata and model cards; validate links in private browsing.
