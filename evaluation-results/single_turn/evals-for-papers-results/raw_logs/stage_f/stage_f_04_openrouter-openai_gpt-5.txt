Great—here’s a concise, venue-by-venue mapping of formatting and artifact expectations (pages, anonymization, code/data), plus how to adapt your current plan for “Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?”. I’ve linked current policies so you can confirm exact page limits/templates and checklists before submission.

Venue-specific expectations (what to satisfy)

NeurIPS (2025)
- Formatting/pages: Use official NeurIPS LaTeX template; main paper page limits and checklist requirements are specified on the CfP and formatting pages (confirm the current limit) [1][2].
- Anonymization: Strict double‑blind; scrub author identities and data sources that could deanonymize [1].
- Ethics/repro: Ethics Guidelines apply; reproducibility checklist typically required; include societal impact/risks if applicable [1][3].
- Code/data: Strongly encouraged and often expected by camera‑ready. Provide an anonymized repository at submission if possible (no personal identifiers; stable link) [1]. 

ICML (2025)
- Formatting/pages: Follow ICML style files; page limits and formatting in the author instructions/example paper (confirm latest) [4][6].
- Anonymization: Double‑blind; no self-identifying links/text [4].
- Ethics/repro: Publication ethics policy applies; reproducibility expectations similar to NeurIPS (configs/seeds, data availability statements) [4][5].
- Code/data: Encouraged at submission; by camera‑ready reviewers expect runnable code/configs for core results [4].

ICLR (2025)
- Formatting/pages: Use ICLR template; page limits in the Author Guide (confirm current); submissions via OpenReview [7].
- Anonymization: Double‑blind on OpenReview; avoid deanonymizing repos or prior preprints in the main text [7].
- Ethics/repro: Reproducibility and limitations are explicitly required sections in recent cycles; code link field in OpenReview [7].
- Code/data: Anonymized code link at submission is strongly encouraged; make public at camera‑ready [7].

ACL Rolling Review (ARR) + ACL main
- Formatting/pages: ARR author guidelines govern formatting; page limits and checklist fields enforced in the submission form [8].
- Anonymization: Double‑blind across cycles [8].
- Ethics/repro: Responsible NLP Research Checklist is mandatory (ethics, data, and artifact fields) [9].
- Code/data: Strong expectation of code and data release or a clear, justified restriction statement; anonymized links at submission [8][9].

COLM (2025)
- Formatting/pages: See Author Guide and template; confirm current limits and structure [10].
- Anonymization: Follow COLM anonymization rules (double‑blind) [10].
- Ethics/repro: Code of Ethics applies; include discussion of risks and limitations [11].
- Code/data: Code/data release encouraged; follow Author Guide for artifact expectations [10][11].

MLSys (2025)
- Formatting/pages: Follow CfP/template; confirm page limits [12].
- Anonymization: Double‑blind review [12].
- Ethics/repro: Strong emphasis on systems reproducibility (hardware, kernels, throughput, cost) [12].
- Code/data/artifacts: Dedicated optional Artifact Evaluation (AE) process; prepare a stable artifact and documentation if you opt in [13].

TMLR (rolling)
- Formatting/pages: Follow TMLR author guide; page structure is journal‑style; confirm any length guidance [14][15].
- Anonymization: Double‑blind during review; use anonymized artifacts [14].
- Ethics/repro: Expect thorough reproducibility (code, configs, datasets or download scripts) and a clear limitations/societal impact statement [14][15].
- Code/data: Strongly encouraged at submission; required for claims that depend on implementation details [14][15].

Plan adaptations for “Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?”

Applies to all venues
- Maintain an anonymized, runnable artifact for core experiments: single-command script, pinned environment, seeds, frozen checkpoints, and data acquisition scripts (no raw mirrors). Include a dataset ledger (name, version, URL/DOI, license, attribution) and an explicit transfer protocol (zero‑shot/few‑shot/full fine‑tune). Add compute/emissions appendix and a limitations/societal impact section.

NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR
- Weeks 1–2: Lock the protocol and baselines; set up anonymized repo (e.g., anonymous GitLab/OSF/Zenodo sandbox DOI) with README to run 1–2 core experiments. Create reproducibility checklist draft aligned with venue fields [1][4][7].
- Weeks 3–5: Complete all transfer matrices and ablations; log seeds/configs; add calibration metrics. Keep figures within template constraints and reserve appendices for detailed per-domain tables [1][2][4][6][7].
- Week 6: Fill ethics/repro checklist; finalize dataset ledger and compute/emissions text. Verify anonymization (no personal metadata in models or repos) [1][3][4][7].
- Week 7–8: Dry‑run replication from a clean machine; fix any nondeterminism; finalize camera‑ready‑ready artifacts (to go public on accept) [1][4][7].

ACL ARR/COLM
- Week 1: Integrate the Responsible NLP Research Checklist items into your outline; add data/annotation ethics fields even if no new human data were collected [8][9][10][11].
- Week 2: Prepare task cards for any NLP‑adjacent datasets; ensure TOS/license compliance statements are explicit. If your MIL work uses language or multimodal data, include a short safety note (harms/bias) [8][9][11].
- Ongoing: Keep monthly ARR cycle in mind—slot your submission to catch the next decision window; ensure anonymized artifact links comply with ARR policy [8][9].
- Pre‑submit: Confirm COLM/ACL final formatting and page limits; include limitations and broader impact paragraphs [8][10][11].

MLSys
- Early: Add systems‑specific reporting to your plan: hardware topology, memory/latency per bag, throughput vs bag size, and CPU/GPU comparisons. Include kernel/backends and quantization specifics if any [12].
- Mid: Prepare an AE‑ready artifact (docker/conda, scripts, small sample inputs) and a 1–2 page Artifact Appendix that describes requirements and expected results. Decide if you’ll opt into AE and reserve one extra week for polishing it [13].

TMLR
- Early: Expect iterative reviews. Your plan should include time to respond to R1 comments (e.g., add one more target domain or replicate an ablation) [14][15].
- Ongoing: Keep the anonymized artifact live from day one; TMLR reviewers often try to run code. Include comprehensive Methods and Reproducibility sections akin to a long‑form appendix [14][15].

Practical deltas to bake into your checklist now
- Insert venue checklists into your draft as subsections: NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR reproducibility items or ARR Responsible NLP questions; answer each explicitly in paper/appendix [1][4][7][9].
- Add anonymized artifact link placeholders in the main text and supplement. Validate links in incognito mode and from a fresh machine (no owner info).
- Keep within page limits by moving transfer matrices, confidence interval tables, and per-domain diagnostics to appendices; keep one compact summary table in the main paper [1][2][4][6][7].
- Ensure license/TOS compliance statements are prominent (end of Experiments or Ethics section) and mirrored in the repo’s LICENSE/NOTICE files [1][8][11][14].

If you tell me your target venue among these, I’ll turn this into a one-page, venue-specific preflight checklist with exact required fields and deadlines.
