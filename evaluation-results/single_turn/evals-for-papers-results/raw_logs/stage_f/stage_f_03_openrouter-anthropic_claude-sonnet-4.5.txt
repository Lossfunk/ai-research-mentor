## ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT (Without Seeing Your Paper)

### 🔴 HIGH-RISK (Potential Desk Reject)

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Medical data without IRB** | High if using Camelyon, TCGA, or hospital data | Obtain IRB exemption letter NOW; if impossible, switch to public non-medical datasets |
| **Missing limitations section** | Medium (required by most venues) | Add 1-paragraph section before conclusion |
| **No statistical significance** | Medium (MIL has high variance) | Report mean ± std over 3+ runs; add t-tests |
| **Undefined "transfer"** | Medium (ambiguous research question) | Clarify: domain shift? task shift? few-shot? zero-shot? |

### 🟡 MEDIUM-RISK (Reviewer Flags)

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Limited domain coverage** | High (hard to test many domains in 6 months) | Acknowledge in limitations; justify domain choices |
| **Missing recent baselines** | Medium (MIL + transfer is active area) | Add comparisons to DSMIL (2021), TransMIL (2021), DTFD-MIL (2022) |
| **Weak theoretical grounding** | Medium (empirical study) | Add analysis: what properties of MIL make transfer hard/easy? |
| **Compute not disclosed** | Low (easy fix) | Add appendix section with GPU hours, CO₂ |

### 🟢 LOW-RISK (Polish)

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Formatting errors** | Low (template-based) | Use Overleaf or latexdiff for version control |
| **Missing code release** | Low (increasingly expected) | Commit to release upon acceptance |
| **Typos** | Low (proofreading) | Use Grammarly or LanguageTool |

## 🔍 MISSING ITEMS (Likely, Based on Title)

Without seeing your paper, here's what MIL transfer papers **commonly omit**:

### Experiments
- [ ] **Negative transfer analysis**: When does transfer hurt vs. help?
- [ ] **Instance-level vs. bag-level transfer**: Which matters more?
- [ ] **Comparison to ImageNet pretraining**: Is MIL-specific pretraining better?
- [ ] **Data efficiency curves**: How much target data is needed?
- [ ] **Cross-architecture transfer**: Does attention-MIL → embedding-MIL work?

### Analysis
- [ ] **Feature visualization**: What do transferred features capture?
- [ ] **Attention map comparison**: Do attention patterns transfer?
- [ ] **Failure modes**: When does transfer completely fail?

### Baselines
- [ ] Train from scratch on target domain
- [ ] ImageNet pretrained encoder + MIL head
- [ ] Domain adaptation methods (DANN, CORAL)
- [ ] Meta-learning approaches (MAML, Prototypical Networks)

### Datasets (if missing)
- [ ] At least 3 source-target pairs from different domains:
  - Medical: Camelyon → TCGA
  - Satellite: Functional Map of World → BigEarthNet
  - Video: ActivityNet → UCF101 (if temporal MIL)
