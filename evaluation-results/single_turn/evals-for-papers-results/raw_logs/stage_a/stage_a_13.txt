Great question. You can contribute meaningfully to AI-for-health without owning a private dataset by focusing on open data, reproducibility, label-efficient methods, and partnerships that don’t require direct data custody.

Practical on-ramps
- Use open public health datasets:
  - Surveys and population health: BRFSS (CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System), NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys), WHO Global Health Observatory (indicators by country). All are free to use after simple registration (DHS) or directly downloadable (BRFSS/NHANES/WHO).
    - BRFSS: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html
    - NHANES: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about/index.html
    - DHS: https://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm
    - WHO GHO: https://www.who.int/data/gho
  - Clinical/ICU and physiologic signals via PhysioNet: MIMIC-IV (ICU EHRs; access requires CITI training and a data use agreement) and eICU-CRD (multi-center ICU; credentialed access), plus many signal datasets on PhysioNet.
    - MIMIC-IV: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/
    - eICU-CRD: https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/2.0/

- Contribute to reproducibility/benchmarking. Rigorous, transparent evaluation and reproducibility are core needs in ML4H; strong papers do careful baselining, calibration, and reporting, not only new models [P1]. You can pick a public dataset and deliver a well-documented, fully reproducible pipeline (data extraction, preprocessing, baselines, confidence intervals, subgroup analysis).
- Collaborate without centralizing data. Federated learning lets you train models across institutions while keeping data local; it’s promising but needs careful documentation and accountability (e.g., FactSheets) [P5]. There is active work on making FL more reproducible and robust under realistic, heterogeneous conditions [P8], and on evaluating predictive reproducibility for medical FL with GNNs [P4].
- Start with synthetic data to prototype. Use Synthea to generate realistic EHR-like data, then apply classical ML or federated learning to develop methods you can later port to real collaborations.
  - Synthea: https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/
- Join active practitioner communities. OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) runs open science projects, tutorials, and codebases that use the OMOP common data model—excellent for methods work and community mentorship.

A simple plan to get started in 4–6 weeks
- Week 1: Pick a public dataset and a focused question. Examples: predict multi-morbidity or undiagnosed diabetes risk from NHANES; model county/state-level outcomes from WHO/BRFSS; ICU mortality or readmission from MIMIC-IV/eICU.
- Week 2: Implement strong baselines and evaluation. Begin with logistic regression, gradient boosting, and a simple neural net. Include calibration (e.g., Platt/temperature scaling), confidence intervals via bootstrapping, and subgroup analysis by age/sex/race to examine fairness. A reproducibility-first orientation aligns with ML4H best practice [P1].
- Week 3: Add one method innovation that lowers data requirements or improves governance. Examples: self-supervised pretraining on tabular/time-series; weak supervision from rules to generate labels; or a federated training simulation across synthetic sites. The governance and accountability framing matters in health; document model cards and data documentation, in the spirit of accountability in FL [P5].
- Week 4–6: Write up a short report, push a clean repo, and share results with a relevant community (OHDSI forum, ML4H/healthcare data science seminars). If you want real-world collaboration, you now have a tangible “methods piece” to propose to local hospitals/health depts with federated/synthetic prototyping to avoid moving data [P5][P8].

Concrete, falsifiable experiments you can run now
1) Self-supervised pretraining for tabular health risk on NHANES
- Hypothesis: Masked-feature or contrastive pretraining on NHANES features improves downstream performance and calibration for predicting multi-morbidity versus training from scratch.
- Variables: Pretraining method (none vs masked autoencoder vs contrastive), labeled data fraction (100%, 50%, 10%), model (MLP vs GBDT as control).
- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC, Brier score, Expected Calibration Error, and subgroup AUROC by age/sex/race.
- Expected outcome: Pretraining improves metrics especially at low label fractions; gains persist after calibration. If not, report negative results and error analysis. This addresses label efficiency and reproducibility needs in ML4H [P1].

2) Federated vs centralized learning with Synthea EHR simulation
- Hypothesis: Federated averaging across 5 synthetic “hospitals” achieves performance within 1–3% AUROC of centralized training while preserving site privacy; heterogeneity (site-specific prevalence) reduces performance unless you use personalization.
- Variables: Data partitioning (IID vs non-IID), algorithm (FedAvg vs centralized vs FedProx), personalization layer (none vs last-layer finetune).
- Metrics: AUROC, macro-F1, site-wise performance variance, communication rounds, and a simple accountability report (hyperparameters, data schema, FL governance metadata) [P5][P8].
- Expected outcome: Federated is close to centralized in IID; personalization helps under non-IID. You’ll produce a reproducible FL benchmark with documentation aligned with accountability recommendations [P5] and reproducibility concerns in realistic FL [P8].

3) Cross-dataset generalization: MIMIC-IV to eICU ICU mortality
- Hypothesis: Models trained on MIMIC-IV degrade when evaluated on eICU due to covariate shift; explicit calibration and domain adaptation reduce the gap.
- Variables: Training data (MIMIC-IV), test data (held-out eICU), methods (logistic regression/GBDT/baseline NN), with vs without calibration or shallow domain adaptation.
- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC, calibration (Brier, ECE), performance drop (ΔAUROC), and subgroup fairness across hospitals.
- Expected outcome: Noticeable generalization gap; calibration improves clinical utility even if discrimination degrades. This addresses reproducibility and generalizability priorities in ML4H [P1] and examines predictive reproducibility across institutions, which is a known challenge and active topic in federated/medical contexts [P4].

4) Accountability in federated learning: FactSheet-style reporting
- Hypothesis: Providing a standardized FactSheet (dataset schemas, site heterogeneity, privacy budget if any, hyperparameters, failure modes) improves external reproducibility and reviewer assessment.
- Variables: Presence vs absence of a FactSheet, independent team’s ability to replicate top-line metrics, and time-to-replicate.
- Metrics: Replication success (yes/no), time cost, absolute metric difference.
- Expected outcome: FactSheet condition improves replication outcomes and reduces time-to-replicate, aligning with calls for accountability in FL [P5] and reproducibility in ML4H [P1].

Tips for finding mentorship and collaborators without data custody
- Join OHDSI working groups or ML4H/health data science reading groups and ask to contribute method pipelines on public or synthetic data.
- Offer to “methods-ize” a partner’s problem: you provide code, documentation, and FL/synthetic prototypes; they keep data in-house. Emphasize governance and accountability in your proposal [P5][P8].
- Target reproducibility papers and workshops; these often welcome solid baselines and careful evaluations [P1].

If you tell me which population or condition most interests you (e.g., chronic disease risk, maternal/child health, ICU outcomes), I can suggest a dataset, a concrete question, and starter code structure.
