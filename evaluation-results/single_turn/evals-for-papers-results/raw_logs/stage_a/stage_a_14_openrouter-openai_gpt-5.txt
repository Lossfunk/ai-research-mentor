Below is a compact, safe, and code-first path you can follow in 6–8 weeks, 2–4 hours/week. It prioritizes authoritative sources (textbooks, official docs, peer‑reviewed or well‑established papers) and reproducible practice so you avoid hype and misinformation.

Principles that keep you safe from misinformation
- Prefer primary, stable sources: textbooks, official docs, and peer‑reviewed or widely adopted benchmarks. Avoid relying on social media summaries without checking the original.
- Run code on tiny subsets before believing claims. If you can’t reproduce at least a small effect with pinned versions and fixed seeds, treat the claim as uncertain.
- Look for: strong baselines, ablations, error analysis, uncertainty (mean ± std over seeds). Red flags: cherry-picked examples, no baselines, moving targets (changing data or metrics midstream).

A minimal learning path (with concrete outputs)
Phase 1 (weeks 1–2): Core foundations, one working baseline
- Read/Do:
  - PyTorch Tutorials: Tensors, Autograd, Training a Classifier.
  - Dive into Deep Learning (D2L): linear models and MLPs on a small dataset (one chapter end‑to‑end).
- Output: one notebook that trains a small classifier (e.g., MNIST/AG News) with fixed seeds and a README describing the task, metric, data source/license, and hardware.

Phase 2 (weeks 3–4): Transformers/LLMs at a shallow depth
- Read/Do:
  - The Illustrated Transformer (for intuition) and run a Hugging Face inference or fine‑tuning tutorial on a tiny text task (≤2k examples).
- Output: a simple text classification or prompt-based evaluation script with one baseline and one controlled change (e.g., decoding temperature).

Phase 3 (weeks 5–6): Responsible evaluation and documentation
- Read/Do:
  - Model Cards (what to document: intended use, limitations, metrics).
  - CheckList for behavioral testing (design 3–5 test cases for your model).
- Output: a short Model Card for your project + a few behavioral tests (e.g., robustness to negations or spelling errors).

Phase 4 (weeks 7–8): Reproducibility and paper reading
- Read/Do:
  - How to read a paper (three‑pass method).
  - “Ten simple rules” for reading scientific papers (note‑taking and critical checks).
- Output: a one‑page note that summarizes one paper’s claim, method, evidence, and 2 weaknesses, plus a tiny replication (even if only the evaluation step).

Three concrete, falsifiable mini‑experiments (each fits a late night)
1) Temperature scaling for calibration (small classifier)
- Hypothesis: Post‑hoc temperature scaling improves Expected Calibration Error (ECE, 15 bins) by at least 20% relative on your test set without changing accuracy by more than 0.5 percentage points.
- Setup: Train a small classifier (e.g., MNIST/AG News). Fit temperature on validation logits; evaluate on test. Run 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Accuracy and ECE mean ± std; paired test across seeds. Reject if ECE drop <20% or accuracy change >0.5 pp.

2) Decoding affects toxicity (LLM, 200 prompts)
- Hypothesis: Lower temperature (0.2 vs 0.8) at fixed top‑p reduces mean toxicity scores by ≥10% on RealToxicityPrompts, with ≤5% change in continuation length at fixed max tokens.
- Setup: Sample 200 prompts, generate continuations under both settings; score with a standard toxicity classifier. 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Mean toxicity and continuation length; paired test. Reject if toxicity drop <10% or if length changes >5%.

3) Behavior tests catch failure modes (text classifier)
- Hypothesis: Your text classifier’s accuracy drops by ≥10 percentage points on CheckList-style perturbations (random character swaps and negation insertion) compared to clean test sentences.
- Setup: Create 100 clean sentences and perturbed counterparts. Evaluate both. 5 seeds for model training.
- Metrics: Accuracy gap (mean ± std); paired test across sentence pairs. Reject if gap <10 pp (then you’ve got a robust model—rare for a first baseline).

A low-overhead weekly cadence
- One small artifact per week: a notebook that re‑runs end‑to‑end on a subset + a 10‑sentence README (task, data/license, metric, seeds, hardware, one limitation).
- Track everything: save a JSON of config (model, data slice, seed, versions) and a CSV of results. This makes it easy to share and get feedback.
- Ask targeted questions in reputable communities (Hugging Face forums, fast.ai): link your repo, state the exact issue, show configs and a minimal failing example.

Tooling that keeps you efficient
- Environment: conda or venv; pin versions (requirements.txt). Use a single seed list (e.g., [0,1,2,3,4]).
- Data hygiene: only open datasets with clear licenses. Prefer ones with dataset cards (e.g., Hugging Face Datasets).
- Evaluation: report mean ± std over seeds; keep subset runs ≤30–60 minutes so you can iterate the same night.

If you share your preferred subarea (LLMs, vision, healthcare) and weekly time budget, I can tailor this into a 4–8 week checklist with exact chapters, tutorials, and runnable notebooks.
