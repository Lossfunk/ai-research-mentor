You can build “mentorship by structure” plus community feedback. Start with a tiny, evaluatable question you can finish in 1–2 weeks, document it well, and share it in open communities to get guidance.

Where to find guided entry points
- Structured, free curricula with active forums:
  - fast.ai “Practical Deep Learning for Coders” (project-first; excellent forum).
  - Dive into Deep Learning (D2L) book + code (hands-on).
  - PyTorch Tutorials; CS231n notes for fundamentals.
- Communities that give feedback:
  - Hugging Face Forums and open-source repos (good for issues, tiny PRs, and eval scripts).
  - ML Collective (reading groups, sprints, mentorship-style feedback).
  - fast.ai forums; EleutherAI Discord (open research discussions).
  - Kaggle (competitions and discussion for baseline-building).
- Lightweight mentorship substitutes:
  - Join a reading group; post short “research notes” for critique.
  - Contribute small PRs: fixes to README/eval scripts, adding a tiny experiment; maintainers often respond with guidance.
  - Apply to seasonal programs (e.g., Google Summer of Code) for structured mentorship; in the meantime, replicate past projects from those orgs.

A 30-day, low-risk plan (2–4 short sessions/week)
- Week 1: Pick one dataset and one metric. Reproduce a tiny baseline on a 100–200 item subset or a 30–60 minute training run. Write a 10-sentence README (task, data license/source, metric, hardware, seeds).
- Week 2: Change exactly one lever (prompt wording, decoding, or a data-cleaning step). Run 3–5 seeds. Log configs and results in a CSV.
- Week 3: Add one ablation or robustness check (category-wise results or alternate metric). Draft a 1–2 page note (hypothesis, setup, results mean ± std, significance, limits).
- Week 4: Share your repo/notebook and note in 1–2 communities above. Ask 1–2 concrete questions (e.g., “Is my evaluation fair? What ablation would you add?”). Iterate once based on feedback.

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments (beginner-friendly, free-tier viable)
1) Truthfulness via guardrail prompting (LLM; 100-item subset)
- Hypothesis: A concise system prompt (“answer carefully; avoid myths; cite facts if unsure”) increases TruthfulQA multiple-choice accuracy by ≥5 percentage points vs a neutral prompt under identical decoding.
- Setup: Sample 100 TruthfulQA MC items, stratified by category; same model and decoding; vary only system prompt. 5 seeds.
- Metric and decision: MC accuracy mean ± std; paired t-test across questions (p < 0.05). Reject if <5 pp or not significant.
- Anchor: TruthfulQA targets common falsehoods; prompting is a standard intervention [TruthfulQA, 2022].

2) Decoding to reduce toxic degeneration (200 prompts)
- Hypothesis: Lower temperature (0.2 vs 0.8) at fixed top‑p reduces mean toxicity score by ≥10% on RealToxicityPrompts with ≤5% change in continuation length (control for max tokens).
- Setup: 200 random prompts; generate with both temps; score with a standard toxicity classifier. 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Mean toxicity and continuation length; paired test. Reject if toxicity drop <10% or length changes >5%.
- Anchor: RealToxicityPrompts measures toxic degeneration under innocuous prompts [Gehman et al., 2020].

3) Data cleaning improves a small classifier (AG News or Emotion)
- Hypothesis: Deduplication plus removal of top‑k likely label errors improves test accuracy by ≥1.0 percentage point over a baseline DistilBERT fine‑tune at fixed compute.
- Setup: Baseline DistilBERT; cleaning = exact/near-duplicate removal and confidence/disagreement-based label-error pruning; retrain. 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Test accuracy and calibration (ECE, 15 bins) mean ± std; paired test across seeds. Reject if thresholds not met.
- Rationale: Label errors are common and affect results; small, principled cleaning often helps [Northcutt et al., 2021].

How to get feedback without a mentor
- Publish minimal, reproducible artifacts: one notebook + README with intended use, limitations, metrics, seeds, and hardware. Model Cards/Datasheets checklists help you cover what reviewers look for.
- Ask concrete questions when you share: “Is this comparison fair?” “What ablation would increase confidence?” “Which failure cases should I report?”
- Build social proof with micro-contributions (docs fixes, small evals) before requesting deeper mentorship.

Responsible practice from day one
- Use openly licensed datasets; document licenses and known risks.
- Include content warnings for toxicity/harms; minimize exposure to harmful outputs by automating scoring.
- Report uncertainty (mean ± std, seeds) and limits; avoid overclaiming. Model Cards/Datasheets are good templates.

If you tell me your preferred area (LLMs vs small text vs vision) and your compute (Colab/Kaggle vs local), I’ll give you a ready-to-run notebook and a one-page experiment plan.
