You can keep up by combining a structured reading workflow, translation support, and targeted community participation. Aim for small, consistent habits that turn papers into actionable notes and tiny replications.

A simple weekly workflow (2–3 papers, 1–2 hours total)
- Three-pass reading: 1) skim title/abstract/figures/conclusion to decide relevance; 2) read methods/experiments more carefully with your questions in mind; 3) deep read only if you plan to reuse the method. This helps you allocate effort efficiently [1].
- “Ten simple rules” mindset: set a specific question before reading, take notes in your own words, and be critical about methods/claims; keep a reading log you can share or revisit [2].

Language-friendly tactics
- Translate strategically: paste the abstract and conclusion into a translator (DeepL/Google) first; if useful, translate the main method section. Keep key terms in English in parentheses to learn vocabulary over time.
- Build a personal glossary: a small CSV of terms (English, your language, 1-sentence definition, example). Add 5–10 terms per week; review quickly before reading.
- Use talk recordings: watch conference tutorials/keynotes on YouTube with slowed playback and auto-captions/translated subtitles; then read the paper’s figures to connect ideas.
- Prefer artifacts with code and plots: Papers With Code entries, repos with READMEs, and Colab badges make papers easier to understand without perfect English.
- Summarize in your language first: write 5–7 bullet “claim-method-evidence-caveats” notes; then translate to English if you’ll share. You’ll comprehend more and write clearer English.

Participate in communities without fluent English
- Ask specific, minimal questions with context: one paragraph including link, the exact section/line you’re stuck on, and what you tried. You’ll get better replies on Hugging Face Forums, fast.ai forums, ML Collective, or Kaggle discussion.
- Start with micro-contributions: fix typos in READMEs, add missing evaluation commands, or reproduce a small table. Maintainers value precise, small PRs more than long prose.
- Join or start a reading group with a one-page template (motivation, 3 key figures, 2 weaknesses, 1 open question). Rotating roles reduce language pressure and build confidence.

Three concrete, falsifiable mini-experiments to build skill
- Translation aids comprehension
  - Hypothesis: Reading abstracts+conclusions with machine translation before the full paper improves your quiz score by ≥20% vs reading only in English.
  - Setup: Pick two recent papers on the same topic. For one, translate abstract+conclusion first; for the other, don’t. Write 10 comprehension questions (definitions, method steps, result direction). Measure scores and time.
  - Decision: If improvement <20%, adjust workflow (e.g., translate method section or add glossary step) and retest next week.

- Three-pass reading saves time without hurting recall
  - Hypothesis: Three-pass reading reduces time spent per paper by ≥30% while keeping recall within 10% of your baseline detailed read [1][2].
  - Setup: Week 1 baseline: do one detailed read, log minutes and a 10-question recall quiz. Week 2: do three-pass on a comparable paper, same quiz format. Compare time and scores.

- Reproduce one figure/table within tolerance
  - Hypothesis: You can reproduce a paper’s primary metric within 5–10% (relative) using its code or a public baseline in ≤2 hours.
  - Setup: Choose a paper with a public repo or a Papers With Code baseline. Run their eval on a small subset; log version/seed/config. Compare your number to the reported one. If off by >10%, write a short forum post with your setup and ask for help.

Make it stick with lightweight tools
- Reading log: a single spreadsheet (paper, link, 3-sentence summary, 2 strengths, 1 concern, next action).
- Note template: one page with “What problem? What assumption? What’s new? How measured? Caveats?”
- Vocabulary: a small flashcard deck (Anki/Cloze) for recurring terms (e.g., calibration, ablation, generalization gap).
- Time-box: 25-minute sessions (Pomodoro); stop when the timer ends and capture one open question.

Where to look each week
- Curated digests: Papers With Code trending, conference highlights (NeurIPS/ICLR tutorial pages), and lab blogs.
- Repos with Colab badges and data loaders; prioritize these when choosing what to read/replicate.
- Forums: Hugging Face and fast.ai for applied Q&A; ML Collective for research-y reading groups.

If you share your preferred subarea (LLMs, vision, healthcare, etc.), I can propose a 4-week reading list with code-first artifacts and talks, plus a glossary starter pack.
