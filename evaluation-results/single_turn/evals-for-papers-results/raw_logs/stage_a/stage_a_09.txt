Short answer: Pick the path where you can build a fast, low-cost experiment loop with clear success metrics in 1–2 weeks. In practice, many beginners find AI ethics (LLM safety/fairness evaluation) faster to iterate because it uses public datasets, APIs, and standard metrics; robotics safety is excellent if you enjoy control/RL and can work in simulators like Safety-Gymnasium with well-defined constraint metrics. [G10][G13]

How to decide quickly
- Minimum viable research loop: Can you run a baseline, get a metric, and iterate within 48 hours? If yes, that area is beginner-friendly for you. [G10][G12]
- Tractability: Prefer questions with public datasets/simulators, standard baselines, and objective metrics (e.g., FPR/FNR, cost violations). [G1][G17]
- Replication-first: Start by reproducing one small result; if replication is painful, consider the other track. [G10][G17]

What “beginner-friendly” looks like in each track
- AI ethics (LLM safety/fairness)
  - Data: Dozens of open evaluation sets for safety, bias, and misuse; see the recent review of LLM safety datasets to pick focused benchmarks (e.g., harm, jailbreaks, toxicity) [P3]. Risks taxonomy papers help you scope measurable harms (bias, misuse, discrimination). [P9][P10]
  - Loop speed: Fast if you use hosted LLMs or small open models and existing evaluation scripts. [P3]
  - Metrics/baselines: Accuracy/precision/recall by subgroup, toxicity scores, harmlessness/ASR on red-teaming sets; baseline = base vs safety-tuned model. [P3]
- Robotics safety
  - Simulators/benchmarks: Safety-Gymnasium offers constraint-based tasks and standard safe-RL baselines (e.g., PPO-Lagrangian, CPO); iteration is feasible on a laptop or modest GPU. [P5]
  - Semantic safety for robot perception/action can be tested with the ASIMOV benchmark to evaluate unsafe action propensity in generated plans. [P6]
  - Metrics/baselines: Episodic return, cost/constraint violation rate, task success rate; baselines from safe-RL libraries. [P5]

A 48-hour “taste test” plan
- Day 1: AI ethics track
  - Choose a concrete safety/bias dataset from the LLM safety datasets review [P3]. Run a baseline model and compute subgroup metrics (e.g., FNR/FPR, toxicity). [P3]
- Day 2: Robotics safety track
  - Install Safety-Gymnasium and run a single constraint task with a built-in safe-RL baseline. Log return and cost violations; perturb environment slightly to see robustness. [P5]
Whichever day yields clearer metrics and ideas for a next experiment is a good starter focus. [G12][G13]

Three to five concrete, falsifiable experiments you can run
- AI ethics
  1) Safety–fairness trade-off in LLMs
     - Hypothesis: A safety-tuned model reduces harmful outputs overall but increases false positives for dialectal or minority-language prompts compared to its base model. [P3][P10]
     - Variables: Model type (base vs RLHF/safety-tuned), prompt dialect; Control: same prompts randomized in order.
     - Metrics: Harmfulness score and refusal rate by subgroup; Δ false-positive rate. Expected: Safety-tuned model shows higher refusal in some subgroups; if not, hypothesis falsified. [P3][P10]
  2) Risk taxonomy coverage test for an LLM safety eval
     - Hypothesis: A commonly used safety evaluation set under-covers at least one risk class in the LM risk taxonomy (e.g., deceptive instructions, targeted harassment). [P9]
     - Method: Map dataset items to taxonomy categories; compute coverage proportions; inter-rater agreement for mapping (Cohen’s kappa ≥0.6). Falsified if coverage is broad and balanced. [P9]
  3) Prompted guardrails vs policy-tuned guardrails
     - Hypothesis: Prompt-only guardrails reduce harmful outputs less than policy-tuned models on long-horizon or indirect-harm scenarios. [P4]
     - Variables: Prompt-only vs tuned models; scenario horizon length; Metrics: harmfulness rate on long-horizon simulation tasks. Falsified if prompt-only performs on par with tuned models. [P4]
- Robotics safety
  4) Reward shaping vs constrained optimization in safe RL
     - Hypothesis: Constrained RL (e.g., PPO-Lagrangian) achieves lower constraint-violation rates than reward-shaping PPO at comparable return on Safety-Gymnasium tasks. [P5]
     - Variables: Algorithm type; domain shift via sensor noise; Metrics: mean episodic return, average cost per episode, cost under noise. Falsified if reward shaping matches or beats constrained RL on both return and cost. [P5]
  5) Semantic safety gating for visuomotor policies
     - Hypothesis: Adding a lightweight “safety gate” classifier reduces unsafe action selections on ASIMOV scenarios by ≥30% with ≤5% drop in task success. [P6]
     - Variables: With/without gate; threshold; Metrics: unsafe action rate, success rate. Falsified if success drops >5% or unsafe rate does not improve materially. [P6]

Beginner-friendly starter packs
- If you pick AI ethics:
  - Start with: “A Systematic Review of Open Datasets for Evaluating and Improving LLM Safety” to choose one safety/bias dataset and its evaluation scripts. [P3]
  - Baselines: Compare a base open LLM to a safety-tuned variant; report subgroup metrics and run ablations on prompt styles. [P3]
- If you pick robotics safety:
  - Start with: Safety-Gymnasium’s built-in tasks and algorithms; reproduce a basic constrained RL result, then test robustness to domain shift. [P5]
  - For perception/action safety: Try the ASIMOV benchmark to probe unsafe action likelihood before any hardware work. [P6]

Choosing criteria (make the call this week)
- Pick the area where you can execute one replication and one ablation in two weeks with your current compute and skills. [G10][G17]
- Favor problems with clear metrics and public baselines so you can get fast feedback and avoid “seductive but low-impact” directions. [G1][G2]
- Personal fit matters—your sustained interest is a real productivity multiplier. [G11][G13]
