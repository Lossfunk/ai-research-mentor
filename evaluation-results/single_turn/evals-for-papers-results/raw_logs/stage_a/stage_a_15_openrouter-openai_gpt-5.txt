You can join remotely by combining open research communities, micro‑contributions, and short, falsifiable projects you can share for feedback. Aim to produce one small, reproducible artifact per week and post it where mentors hang out.

Where to plug in today (remote, active)
- ML Collective: open collab community with Slack, reading groups, and paper sprints; beginner‑friendly and research‑oriented [1].
- EleutherAI: active Discord with working groups; their Summer of Open AI Research (SOAR) is a remote mentorship-style program you can watch for or emulate with self‑guided projects [2][3].
- Google Summer of Code: remote, mentored open‑source contributions; browse current organizations and note application windows (organizations vary by year) [5].
- Also good entry points: Hugging Face forums (applied research Q&A), fast.ai forums (supportive for first contributions), Kaggle (reproducible baselines and discussion). Start with micro‑PRs (docs, eval scripts) or small replications.

A practical 8‑week remote plan
- Weeks 1–2: Pick one public repo with a clear eval script (e.g., a small text/image classifier). Reproduce the baseline on a tiny subset in ≤60 minutes. Publish a minimal README (task, data source/license, metric, seeds, hardware). Introduce yourself in one community with a link and 1–2 specific questions.
- Weeks 3–4: Change one lever (prompt/decoding, seed, data cleaning) and add one robustness check. Post a 1–2 page note (hypothesis, setup, results mean ± std, limits) and ask for one concrete suggestion.
- Weeks 5–6: Join a reading group (or start a small one). Present a 5‑minute “what I replicated + one failure case” lightning talk.
- Weeks 7–8: Apply to a program (e.g., GSoC) or take a labeled “good first issue” in your chosen repo. Schedule a weekly cowork session with peers from ML Collective or EleutherAI to keep momentum [1][2].

How to request mentorship effectively (async)
- Share a minimal, reproducible artifact (notebook + README).
- Ask one precise question: “Is my comparison fair?” “Which ablation would most increase confidence?” Include configs, seeds, and logs.
- Offer value first: fix a small bug, improve docs, or add a tiny evaluation—maintainers respond faster when you’ve shipped something concrete.

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments (remote‑friendly)
1) Seed sensitivity matters
- Hypothesis: Test accuracy of a small classifier (e.g., DistilBERT on AG News or ResNet‑18 on CIFAR‑10) varies by ≤2 percentage points across 5 random seeds at fixed config.
- Setup: Train the same model/config 5 times with seeds S = {0..4}. Pin versions and hardware. Keep training time ≤60 minutes total.
- Metrics: Mean ± std accuracy; max–min gap. Reject if gap >2 pp. If rejected, report the variability—this itself is a valuable reproducibility note.

2) Temperature scaling improves calibration without hurting accuracy
- Hypothesis: Post‑hoc temperature scaling reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE, 15 bins) by ≥20% relative with accuracy change ≤0.5 pp.
- Setup: Train a small classifier; fit temperature on validation logits; evaluate on test; 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Accuracy and ECE mean ± std; paired test across seeds. Reject if ECE drop <20% or accuracy shift >0.5 pp.

3) Decoding can reduce toxicity in LLM outputs
- Hypothesis: Lower temperature (0.2 vs 0.8) at fixed top‑p reduces mean toxicity by ≥10% on RealToxicityPrompts, with ≤5% change in continuation length at fixed max tokens.
- Setup: Sample 200 prompts; generate continuations under both settings with the same model; score with a standard toxicity classifier; 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Mean toxicity and continuation length; paired test. Reject if toxicity drop <10% or length changes >5%.

Tips to make remote collaboration work
- Keep runs short and seeds fixed so others can reproduce quickly.
- Use issue templates and PR checklists; summarize your changes in 5–10 bullet points with links to logs/results.
- Time‑box: 2–4 hours/week is enough if you ship one small artifact weekly.
- Be transparent about limits and risks in a short Model Card‑style README (intended use, metrics, limitations). This builds trust and invites mentorship.

Literature anchors (read once, reuse often)
- Mitchell et al., 2019. Model Cards for Model Reporting — a concise template for responsible documentation you can apply to every small project: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993
- Keshav. How to Read a Paper (three‑pass method) — helps you quickly judge what to replicate next: https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/confcour/CMSC838K/how-to-read-a-paper.pdf

If you share your subarea (LLMs, vision, healthcare) and weekly time, I can propose 2–3 specific repos with good first issues and a 4‑week micro‑roadmap.
