I appreciate your interest in AI safety, but I need to be direct: **2 hours per week is likely insufficient to make meaningful research contributions** to AI safety, especially if you're new to the field. Research—particularly in a technical, fast-moving area—typically requires sustained focus, deep engagement with literature, and iterative experimentation.

That said, there are **realistic ways to contribute** given your time constraints. Let me outline what's feasible and what's not.

## What's Realistic with 2 Hours/Week

### 1. **Build Knowledge & Stay Informed** (Months 1-6)

**Goal**: Develop literacy in AI safety concepts

- **Read foundational materials** (15-30 min/week):
  - [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/) curriculum (structured, self-paced)
  - Key posts from [Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)
  - Surveys like "[Unsolved Problems in ML Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13916)" (Hendrycks et al., 2021)

- **Follow key researchers** (15 min/week):
  - Subscribe to newsletters: [Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/), [Alignment Newsletter](https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/)
  - Follow on Twitter/X: Paul Christiano, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Rohin Shah, Victoria Krakovna

- **Listen to podcasts** (during commute/exercise):
  - [The 80,000 Hours Podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/) (AI safety episodes)
  - [AXRP (AI X-risk Research Podcast)](https://axrp.net/)

**Outcome**: In 6 months, you'll understand the landscape and key debates

### 2. **Micro-Contributions** (After building basics)

These don't require deep research but add value:

**A. Distillation & Communication**
- Write clear explanations of technical AI safety papers for broader audiences
- Create visualizations or summaries of key concepts
- Contribute to [AI Safety Support](https://www.aisafetysupport.org/) or similar community resources

**B. Red-Teaming & Testing**
- Participate in public red-teaming efforts (e.g., [Anthropic's red-teaming](https://www.anthropic.com/index/red-teaming-language-models))
- Test AI systems for failure modes and document findings
- Contribute to adversarial testing datasets

**C. Community Support**
- Help moderate forums or organize local reading groups
- Mentor newcomers (once you have 6-12 months of learning)
- Curate resources or maintain bibliographies

**D. Micro-Tasks for Existing Projects**
- Some research groups post small, well-defined tasks (data labeling, code review, literature searches)
- Check [AI Safety Support's job board](https://www.aisafetysupport.org/lots-of-links) for volunteer opportunities

### 3. **Targeted Skill-Building** (If aiming for future contributions)

If your goal is to eventually contribute more substantially:

**Option A: Slow, steady learning**
- Dedicate 2 hours/week to a structured course (AGI Safety Fundamentals, ML basics)
- In 1-2 years, you'll have enough background to engage more deeply
- Then consider increasing time commitment or transitioning careers

**Option B: Strategic upskilling**
- If you have relevant expertise (ML, philosophy, policy, security), focus on applying it to safety
- Example: If you're a software engineer, contribute to open-source AI safety tools
- Example: If you're in policy, engage with AI governance work

## What's NOT Realistic with 2 Hours/Week

**You likely cannot**:
- Publish original research papers in technical AI safety
- Develop novel alignment techniques or theoretical frameworks
- Run meaningful experiments (requires compute, iteration, debugging time)
- Keep up with the rapidly evolving literature while also doing original work
- Compete with full-time researchers for attention/impact

**Why**: Research requires:
- Deep, uninterrupted focus (hard to achieve in 2-hour chunks)
- Iteration cycles (experiments, feedback, revision)
- Staying current with fast-moving literature (itself a multi-hour/week commitment)
- Building relationships and collaborations

## Honest Assessment: Impact vs. Time

Here's a rough calibration:

| Time/Week | Realistic Contribution |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 2 hours | Stay informed, micro-contributions, slow skill-building |
| 5-10 hours | Meaningful volunteer work, assist existing projects, write distillations |
| 20+ hours | Independent research, paper authorship, novel contributions |
| 40+ hours | Competitive research output (full-time) |

## Alternative High-Impact Options

If your goal is **maximum impact on AI safety** with limited time:

### 1. **Donate to AI Safety Organizations**
If you have a well-paying job, **earning to give** may be higher impact than 2 hours/week of research:
- [Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI)](https://intelligence.org/)
- [Alignment Research Center (ARC)](https://alignment.org/)
- [Center for AI Safety (CAIS)](https://www.safe.ai/)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) (if they accept donations)

### 2. **Career Transition (Long-term)**
Use 2 hours/week to **plan a transition** into AI safety work:
- Build skills systematically
- Network with researchers
- Apply for roles in 1-2 years when ready

### 3. **Advocacy & Governance**
Non-technical contributions that may fit 2 hours/week:
- Engage with AI policy (contact representatives, comment on regulations)
- Support organizations like [Center for AI Policy](https://www.aipolicy.us/)
- Raise awareness in your professional network

## Concrete Next Steps (This Month)

**Week 1-2**:
- Enroll in [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/) (free, self-paced)
- Read "[Concrete Problems in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)" (Amodei et al., 2016)

**Week 3-4**:
- Join [AI Safety Support](https://www.aisafetysupport.org/) community
- Explore their volunteer opportunities board
- Identify one micro-contribution you can make (e.g., summarize a paper, help with a small task)

**Month 2**:
- Assess: Do you want to increase time commitment, or find alternative impact pathways?
- If staying at 2 hours/week, focus on knowledge-building and micro-contributions
- If aiming for research, develop a 1-2 year plan to transition

## Key Takeaway

**Be realistic about impact, but don't be discouraged.** With 2 hours/week:
- You can become **informed and engaged** in AI safety
- You can make **small, valuable contributions** (distillation, testing, community support)
- You **cannot** do competitive research (yet)

If AI safety is truly important to you, consider:
1. **Short-term**: Maximize learning and micro-contributions
2. **Long-term**: Plan to increase time commitment or find high-leverage alternatives (donations, career transition, advocacy)

The field needs diverse contributions—not everyone has to be a full-time researcher. But it's important to match your expectations to your available time.
