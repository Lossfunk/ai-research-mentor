This is a fantastic area to work in, and I want to start with good news: **lack of datasets is NOT a barrier to contributing to AI-for-health research.** In fact, some of the most impactful work in this space doesn't require novel datasets at all. Let me show you multiple pathways.

## Understanding the Landscape

### Why Public Health AI is Different

**Public health vs. clinical medicine:**
- **Public health**: Population-level, prevention, policy, equity, social determinants
- **Clinical medicine**: Individual diagnosis, treatment, patient care

**This distinction matters because:**
- Public health often uses aggregated, de-identified data (more accessible)
- Many important questions don't require individual patient records
- Policy and equity questions can use public datasets
- Implementation and deployment research is critically needed

**You can contribute meaningfully without access to hospital data.**

## Pathway 2: Work on Implementation and Deployment Research

### The "Last Mile" Problem

**Critical gap in AI-for-health:**
- Many models are developed
- Few are actually deployed and used
- Even fewer are evaluated in real-world settings

**This is where you can contribute without new datasets:**

**Research questions that need answers:**

1. **Implementation science**:
   - How do we deploy AI tools in resource-limited settings?
   - What are barriers to adoption by public health practitioners?
   - How do we design for real-world constraints?

2. **Human-AI interaction**:
   - How should public health workers interact with AI tools?
   - What interfaces work best for different users?
   - How do we build trust and appropriate reliance?

3. **Equity and fairness**:
   - Do existing models work equally well for all populations?
   - How do we audit models for disparate impact?
   - How do we design equitable AI systems?

4. **Evaluation and validation**:
   - How do we evaluate AI tools in public health contexts?
   - What metrics matter beyond accuracy?
   - How do we measure real-world impact?

**Example projects (no new data needed):**

**Project 1: Audit existing models for equity**

## Pathway 4: Collaborate to Access Data

### Finding Data Through Partnerships

**You don't need to own data—you need access:**

**Collaboration strategies:**

**1. Partner with public health departments:**

**Why they might work with you:**
- They have data but lack AI expertise
- They need help analyzing data
- They want to answer specific questions
- They value academic partnerships

**How to approach:**
- Identify specific problem they face
- Offer your AI skills
- Propose mutually beneficial project
- Be flexible and responsive to their needs

**Example email:**
```

- **Data needed**: Any public health dataset
- **Impact**: Increased adoption and appropriate use

**Example project:**
- Develop interpretable models for disease prediction
- Compare to black-box models
- Evaluate with public health practitioners
- Create guidelines for interpretable public health AI

**5. Small data and few-shot learning:**
- **Problem**: Many public health contexts have limited data

- **Impact**: AI for resource-limited settings

**Example project:**
- Develop few-shot learning methods for disease detection
- Test on small subsets of public data
- Compare to traditional methods
- Evaluate in simulated low-resource settings

**6. Multi-modal and multi-source integration:**
- **Problem**: Public health data comes from many sources
- **Research**: Integrate diverse data types
- **Data needed**: Multiple public datasets (health, environmental, social)
- **Impact**: More comprehensive understanding

**Example project:**
- Integrate health data (NHANES) with environmental data (EPA) and social data (Census)
- Develop methods for multi-source learning
- Analyze social determinants of health
- Identify intervention targets

## Pathway 6: Policy and Evaluation Research
