Great fit: your physics training in modeling, math, and experiment design transfers directly to AI. Here’s a concise, evidence‑based starting plan, plus three falsifiable experiments to build research muscle.

Mindset and workflow
- Start with small, crisp hypotheses and iterate fast. Avoid vague “improve SOTA” goals; instead design experiments that answer one question at a time [G2].  
- Bake in reproducibility early: fixed seeds, config files, baselines, ablations, and multiple runs with confidence intervals [G1][G18].  
- Cultivate research taste by deliberately practicing framing, reading exemplars, and reflecting on what makes an idea promising to you [G12][G13].

Core skills (4–8 weeks, in parallel with projects)
- Math: refresh linear algebra (SVD, eigendecomposition), probability (Bayes rule, concentration, log-likelihood), and optimization (gradient descent, convexity, L2/L1) with a focus on how they appear in loss functions and regularization [G1].  
- Python + tooling: NumPy, PyTorch, plotting, experiment tracking (e.g., a simple CSV/JSON log plus seed control) [G1].  
- ML fundamentals: bias–variance, cross‑validation, calibration, and when to use regularization/augmentation [G1].  
- Deep learning basics: CNNs for images and Transformers for sequences. As an anchoring example, ResNet is a widely used CNN family for vision and a good baseline to reproduce before trying novel ideas [P4].

A practical learning loop
1) Reproduce a simple baseline on a canonical dataset (MNIST, CIFAR‑10, IMDb).  
2) Add one change that tests a hypothesis (optimizer, augmentation, capacity).  
3) Report with plots, confidence intervals, and ablations. Keep code tidy and seeds fixed [G2][G18].

Suggested sequence (first 6–10 weeks)
- Weeks 1–2: Implement linear/logistic regression and a 2‑layer MLP from scratch; write backprop by hand for a toy problem [G2].  
- Weeks 3–4: Train a small CNN on MNIST then CIFAR‑10; compare SGD vs Adam and LR schedules [G1].  
- Weeks 5–6: Train a small Transformer or fine‑tune a compact pretrained model for sentiment classification; evaluate with proper splits and calibration checks [G18].  
- Weeks 7–10: Choose a narrowly scoped project (one dataset, one baseline, one main change). Target a clear question and 2–3 ablations [G2][G12].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments you can run now
1) Does Adam reach a target test accuracy faster than SGD on MNIST for small CNNs at equal compute?
- Hypothesis: Adam converges to a given accuracy (e.g., 98%) in fewer steps than SGD at the same batch size.  
- Variables: optimizer ∈ {SGD(momentum=0.9), Adam}, learning rate schedule (cosine vs step), batch size fixed.  
- Metrics: time‑to‑target‑accuracy, final test accuracy after fixed budget, stability across 5 seeds.  
- Expected outcome: Faster time‑to‑target for Adam; similar final accuracy if both are tuned. Conclude with CIs and loss/accuracy curves [G1][G18].

2) On CIFAR‑10, does simple augmentation outperform increasing model depth at fixed compute?
- Hypothesis: Baseline ResNet‑18 with standard augmentations (random crop/flip) achieves higher test accuracy than a deeper model (e.g., +1 residual stage) without augmentation when total training time is fixed.  
- Variables: augmentation on/off; depth; compute budget (epochs × images/sec) fixed.  
- Metrics: test accuracy, calibration (ECE), train/test loss gap, runtime.  
- Expected outcome: Augmentation provides better robustness/generalization per unit compute than extra depth. Validate across 3–5 seeds and report CIs [G2][G18][P4].

3) Transfer learning vs. training from scratch on a small text classification task
- Hypothesis: Fine‑tuning a small pretrained Transformer reaches a given F1 with fewer labeled examples than training a comparable model from scratch.  
- Variables: training regime ∈ {pretrained‑init, random‑init}; sample size ∈ {500, 1k, 5k}.  
- Metrics: F1/AUROC on held‑out set, data efficiency (examples to reach target F1), variance across seeds.  
- Expected outcome: Pretrained models are more sample‑efficient; quantify the crossover point in examples needed [G1][G18].

How to evaluate and report like a researcher
- Always include: dataset details, splits, preprocessing; exact hyperparameters; compute budget; number of seeds; CIs; and ablations (remove your “one change” to show the delta) [G1][G18].  
- Frame your contribution as a question answered by evidence (plots/tables), not as claims without controls [G2][G10].  
- Reflect on why your result matters and what breaks it—this builds research taste and follow‑up ideas [G12][G13].

Bridging your physics background
- Lean into strengths: modeling, differential equations, inverse problems, and simulation. Vision baselines (e.g., ResNet) are well‑trodden and excellent for learning experimental rigor before jumping into scientific ML domains such as simulation surrogates or control [P4].  
- Use the same empirical discipline you used in the lab: careful measurement, uncertainty, and ablation logic [G1][G18].

Immediate next steps (1–2 weeks)
- Set up a clean repo template with config files, seed control, logging, and plotting [G18].  
- Reproduce MNIST and CIFAR‑10 baselines; run Experiment 1.  
- Write a 1‑page lab note per experiment: hypothesis, setup, results, interpretation, next experiment [G2].

If you share your target subfield (vision, NLP, RL, scientific ML), I can propose a 6‑week project plan and paper reproduction targets tailored to it.
