Absolutely. Here’s a staged, evidence-based learning path that prioritizes canonical materials, reproducible practice, and clear evaluation so you can avoid hype and misinformation.

Phase 1 — Core foundations (math + ML)
- Goals: Probability, linear algebra, optimization basics; classical ML models and evaluation.
- Primary texts:
  - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop, 2006). Rigorous probability-first ML; Chapter 1–3, 4–5, 7–9 cover most foundations. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf
  - Probabilistic ML (Murphy). Start with the classic ML: a Probabilistic Perspective for principled models and inference. https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html and https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/
- Study hygiene:
  - Read papers efficiently (3-pass method) to avoid chasing hype: Keshav, “How to Read a Paper.” http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf
  - Watch for systems pitfalls: Sculley et al., “Hidden Technical Debt in ML Systems.” https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf

- Primary text:
  - Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville). Chapters on optimization, regularization, convnets, sequence modeling. https://www.deeplearningbook.org/

  - OECD AI Principles (trustworthy AI, accountability). https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles
  - EU AI Act (overview of risk tiers and obligations). https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2024-0138_EN.pdf

Habits to stay current without hype
- Prioritize: peer-reviewed venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL) and official arXiv versions of widely cited work.
- Use evaluation-first views: HELM dashboards and leaderboard papers to contextualize claims. https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/
- Track code and replications: Papers with Code (or its GitHub mirror). https://github.com/paperswithcode
- Follow sober lab blogs: BAIR blog (method-focused). https://bair.berkeley.edu/
- Read slowly and reproduce small-scale results before adopting big claims. Prefer papers with released code and clear eval protocols.

A crisp 12–16 week plan (5–8 hrs/week)
- Weeks 1–4: Bishop (Ch. 1–3, 4–5), Murphy selected chapters. Implement linear/logistic regression, regularization, cross-validation; write a 1-page model card per model.
- Weeks 5–8: Goodfellow DL (optimization, regularization, convnets). Reproduce MNIST/CIFAR-10 baselines; follow NeurIPS checklist for runs.
- Weeks 9–12: Transformers and LLMs: read Vaswani→BERT→GPT-3→Chinchilla; implement a tiny Transformer on character-level data; try LoRA on a small task; evaluate with held-out sets.
- Weeks 13–16: RAG and instruction tuning basics; run HELM-style metrics on your models; create datasheets for any dataset you assemble; write a short “risk and misuse” section using NIST AI RMF.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments you can run safely
1) Tiny Transformer scaling and context length
- Hypothesis: Per-token perplexity improves sublinearly with model depth and benefits from increased context length up to a task-dependent limit.
- Setup: Train 3–4 decoder-only Transformers (e.g., 0.5M, 2M, 8M, 30M params) on WikiText-2 or TinyStories; vary context length {128, 512, 1024}.
- Metrics: Validation perplexity vs. parameters and context; training FLOPs; wall-clock; calibration error.
- Expected outcome: Diminishing returns with scale; longer contexts help until overfitting/optimization issues appear, consistent with scaling insights (Hoffmann et al., 2022). https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556
- Reproducibility: Fixed seeds, identical tokenizers, publish config and code; NeurIPS checklist. https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf

2) LoRA vs full fine-tuning for task adaptation
- Hypothesis: LoRA achieves ≥95% of full fine-tune accuracy on a small supervised task with a fraction of trainable parameters and memory.
- Setup: Start from an open 1–3B parameter model; fine-tune on SST-2 or another small classification dataset using (a) full FT and (b) LoRA (vary rank r∈{4,8,16}).
- Metrics: Accuracy/F1 on held-out test, trainable parameter count, peak GPU memory, time-to-target.
- Expected outcome: LoRA closely matches full FT with orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable params (Hu et al., 2021). https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685
- Documentation: Release a model card with training data, hyperparameters, and limitations. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993

3) Does RAG reduce hallucination on factual QA?
- Hypothesis: RAG reduces factual error rate vs. a base LLM on open-domain QA, especially on questions outside pretraining distribution.
- Setup: Build a small retrieval index (e.g., English Wikipedia subset or your domain corpus). Evaluate base LLM vs LLM+RAG on a curated question set; include a TruthfulQA subset for stress testing.
- Metrics: Exact match/F1; human judge factuality; citation coverage; error taxonomy. Report per-category results and inter-annotator agreement.
- Expected outcome: RAG improves factuality on knowledge-intensive queries (Lewis et al., 2020) and may reduce falsehoods on some TruthfulQA categories. https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401; https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958
- Governance: Add a short NIST AI RMF “Map/Measure” note on residual risks and misuse. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/nist.ai.100-1.pdf

A short misinformation-avoidance checklist
- Prefer primary sources: official arXiv or publisher pages; skim related work and limitations.
- Demand evaluation details: datasets, contamination controls, metrics, ablations, and error bars (HELM/MMLU/GLUE/SuperGLUE norms).
- Require reproducibility: code, seeds, hardware, and a clear experimental section (use the NeurIPS checklist).
- Document responsibly: Model Cards; Datasheets for Datasets; Data Statements for NLP to surface biases and constraints.

If you share your background (math/programming, time/week), I can tailor this into a week-by-week schedule with specific chapters, labs, and checkpoints.
