Great space to enter. Here’s a feasible, low-friction path to start ML-for-climate in 6–8 weeks, plus three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments you can run on a laptop or a single GPU.

Note: I couldn’t access an internal mentorship-guidelines tool, so I relied on public sources and benchmarks below.

A simple starting map (pick one)
- Climate projections/emulation: Learn mappings from forcings to climate responses using curated benchmarks like ClimateBench [2][3].
- Environmental monitoring/forecasting: Predict air quality with OpenAQ and meteorology from ERA5 [4][5].
- Cryosphere trends: Forecast sea-ice extent using NSIDC’s long-term records [6].
- Longer-term climate model outputs: Explore CMIP6 projections (or downscaled CMIP6) once you’re comfortable with data formats [7].

A practical 6–8 week plan
1) Choose one small, public dataset with a clear task
- ClimateBench (emulation of temperature/precipitation from forcing inputs) has ready-to-use data and metrics [2][3].
- OpenAQ PM2.5 for a single city (e.g., Delhi, London) for next-day forecasts; combine with ERA5 weather covariates via latitude/longitude and time [4][5].
- NSIDC Sea Ice Index for monthly Arctic extent forecasting [6].

2) Set up the minimal stack
- Python + PyTorch or scikit-learn; for climate data, add xarray/netCDF4 for gridded data (ERA5, ClimateBench) [2][4].
- Access data in the cloud when possible (Pangeo ML data listing and tutorials help) [8].

3) Reproduce a tiny baseline
- ClimateBench: fit a linear regression or small MLP to predict surface temperature anomaly; match ClimateBench metrics (MAE/RMSE, spatial/temporal splits) [2][3].
- OpenAQ: build a naive “persistence” baseline (tomorrow equals today), then ARIMA or linear regression [5].
- Sea ice: seasonal naive baseline (predict same month’s historical mean), then a small LSTM or linear model [6].

4) Turn the baseline into research with one-variable-at-a-time hypotheses
- Change one ingredient (feature set, architecture, loss, regularization), keep everything else fixed, evaluate on a held-out split with multiple seeds.

5) Evaluate and report cleanly
- Use simple, relevant metrics (MAE/RMSE for regression; MAPE; skill over baseline). Document data source, split, seeds, hardware, and compute budget.

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments
1) Climate emulation with ClimateBench
- Hypothesis: Adding aerosol and land-use forcing inputs (beyond greenhouse gases only) reduces MAE for decadal-mean surface air temperature anomaly by at least 5% on the ClimateBench validation split.
- Data: ClimateBench v1.0 inputs/targets and official splits [2][3].
- Setup: Compare two models (linear regression or 2-layer MLP): (a) GHG-only inputs vs (b) GHG + aerosol + land-use. Train with identical optimizer, epochs, and seeds (e.g., 5 seeds).
- Metrics: MAE and RMSE reported as mean ± std across seeds; paired t-test (p < 0.05). If the mean reduction < 5% or not significant, reject.

2) City-level next-day PM2.5 forecasting
- Hypothesis: A multivariate model using ERA5 meteorological covariates (2-m temperature, 10-m wind, boundary layer height) with OpenAQ history achieves ≥10% lower MAE than a persistence baseline for next-day PM2.5 in one city (2019–2023).
- Data: OpenAQ PM2.5 for one city [5]; collocate daily ERA5 variables by station coordinates/time [4].
- Setup: Train/validation/test split by time (e.g., 2019–2021 train, 2022 val, 2023 test). Models: (a) persistence baseline, (b) linear regression or gradient boosting with lagged PM2.5 + ERA5 features. 5 seeds via bootstrap resamples.
- Metric: Test MAE; report relative improvement versus persistence. If improvement < 10% or inconsistent across resamples, reject.

3) One-month-ahead Arctic sea-ice extent forecast
- Hypothesis: A simple seasonal-naive+trend linear model reduces 1-month-ahead RMSE by ≥15% compared to pure seasonal-naive on NSIDC Sea Ice Index (Arctic, 1980–2015 train, 2016–2023 test).
- Data: NSIDC Sea Ice Index monthly extent time series [6].
- Setup: Baselines: (a) seasonal naive (predict the same calendar month’s historical mean), (b) linear model with month-of-year dummies + linear time trend. Optionally add ENSO index later.
- Metric: Test RMSE and skill vs seasonal naive. If reduction < 15%, reject.

Lightweight alternatives you can try later
- Downscaling: Use ERA5 coarse-resolution fields to predict finer fields with a super-resolution CNN; evaluate RMSE/CRPS and compare to bicubic interpolation [4].
- Land monitoring with satellite imagery: Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine for land cover change detection; start with a classical NDVI-threshold baseline before deep models [9].

Two literature anchors to orient yourself
- Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning (overview of where ML is useful across mitigation, adaptation, and science) [1].
- ClimateBench v1.0: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Climate Projections (defines a reproducible benchmark for climate emulation) [2].

If you tell me your compute (laptop vs single GPU) and which of the three tracks (emulation, air quality, or sea ice) you want, I can give exact hyperparameters, data-loading snippets, and a 4-week micro-syllabus.
