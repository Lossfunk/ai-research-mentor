Great goal. With only free resources, you can still do meaningful, responsible AI research by (a) picking tiny, well-scoped questions, (b) adhering to documentation/ethics norms, and (c) sharing fully reproducible artifacts.

Responsible foundations (do these from day one)
- Read dataset/model cards before using anything; note licenses, potential harms, and intended use. Follow Model Cards and Datasheets checklists when you document your own work (even small projects) [Mitchell et al., 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287596), [Gebru et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010).
- Respect terms of service and copyright. Don’t scrape sites that forbid it; use openly licensed datasets.
- Avoid sensitive data (PII, medical, or explicit content). If you evaluate toxicity/truthfulness, minimize exposure (don’t read raw outputs if not needed; score with automated tools), and include content warnings.
- Keep compute modest (Colab/Kaggle is enough). Small baselines and careful evaluation beat big models when you’re learning.
- Make everything reproducible: fix seeds, log configs, put code and a short README in a public repo/notebook.

A free, high‑quality learning path (2–4 weeks, 2–4 hours/week)
- Hands-on course: fast.ai “Practical Deep Learning for Coders” (free, project-first) [1]. Pair this with PyTorch tutorials and the free book “Dive into Deep Learning” for reference.
- Tools: Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks (free GPUs), Hugging Face Datasets/Transformers for quick experiments.
- Workflow habit: every session ends with a saved notebook, pinned package versions, and a 5–10 sentence log of what you tried and learned.

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments (free-tier friendly)
1) Truthfulness via prompting (LLM, 100-item subset)
- Hypothesis: A short “be careful; avoid myths; cite facts if unsure” system prompt raises multiple-choice TruthfulQA accuracy by ≥5 percentage points vs a neutral prompt, with identical decoding.
- Setup: Use the TruthfulQA MC subset (sample 100 items). Same model, temperature, and top‑p; vary only the system prompt. Run 5 seeds (sampling seeds).
- Metric: MC accuracy (mean ± std); paired t-test across questions (p < 0.05). Reject if <5 pp or not significant.
- Anchor: TruthfulQA measures whether models reproduce common falsehoods; prompting is a standard, low-code intervention [TruthfulQA, 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.229/).

2) Data cleaning improves a small text classifier (AG News or Emotion)
- Hypothesis: Deduplication + removal of top‑k likely label errors improves test accuracy by ≥1.0 percentage point over a baseline DistilBERT fine‑tune at fixed compute.
- Setup: Baseline: fine‑tune DistilBERT. Cleaning: exact/near-duplicate removal; identify likely label errors via cross-validated confidence (e.g., cleanlab or simple disagreement heuristics); drop top‑k; retrain. 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Accuracy and calibration (ECE, 15 bins), mean ± std; paired test across seeds. Reject if accuracy gain <1.0 pp or ECE worsens materially.
- Anchor: Label errors are common; small, principled cleaning can materially change results [Northcutt et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02104).

3) Simple augmentations for robustness on CIFAR‑10
- Hypothesis: RandAugment improves CIFAR‑10‑C mean accuracy by ≥3.0 pp over flip+crop at similar clean accuracy (within ±0.5 pp).
- Setup: Train ResNet‑18 baseline with flip+crop vs RandAugment, matched epochs/compute. 5 seeds. Evaluate clean CIFAR‑10 and CIFAR‑10‑C (mean over severities).
- Metrics: Test accuracy mean ± std; significance via paired test across corruptions. Reject if thresholds not met.
- Anchors: CIFAR‑10‑C for corruption robustness; simple augmentations like RandAugment often help [Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261), [Cubuk et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13719).

A simple weekly cadence (keeps you responsible and productive)
- Week 1: Pick one experiment. Reproduce a tiny baseline (50–200 items or a few epochs). Write down dataset license, splits, metrics, seeds, and hardware in your README.
- Week 2: Run your intervention and 1 ablation (e.g., different prompt wording or augmentation strength). Use 3–5 seeds.
- Week 3: Analyze results, do one robustness check (category-wise results, or alternate metric), and write a short 1–2 page report.
- Week 4: Share your notebook/repo and a one-paragraph summary (what changed, by how much, with what cost and caveats). Invite feedback.

Where to learn and build for free
- Course: fast.ai “Practical Deep Learning for Coders” is free and project-driven [1]. Pair with PyTorch tutorials and D2L for reference.
- Compute: Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks (free GPUs).
- Datasets/Models: Hugging Face Datasets/Transformers; many tasks run on CPU or small free GPUs.

If you tell me whether you prefer text or vision, and whether you have Colab/Kaggle access, I can give you a ready-to-run notebook template for one of the experiments above.
