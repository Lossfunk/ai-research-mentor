Based on the literature on PeerRead and aspect score prediction, I can help you frame modest gains constructively. This is actually a common challenge in peer review prediction tasks due to inherent noise and subjectivity.

## Framing Modest Gains: Strategic Approaches

### 1. **Contextualize Performance Against Baselines**

**Frame it as:**
"While our models achieve modest improvements over baselines (X% → Y%), this gain is meaningful given the inherent subjectivity of peer review. Prior work has shown that inter-reviewer agreement on aspect scores is often moderate (Cohen's κ = 0.2-0.4 for some aspects), suggesting a performance ceiling for automated prediction."

**Supporting evidence to add:**
- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (IAA) on your dataset's aspect scores
- Show that your model's error is comparable to or lower than human disagreement
- Position the gap between your performance and IAA as the "irreducible error" due to legitimate differences in expert opinion

### 2. **Reframe the Task Value**

**Instead of:** "Predicting exact aspect scores"  
**Emphasize:** 
- **Ranking quality**: "Our model achieves Spearman ρ = X for ranking papers by aspect scores, which is sufficient for triage or identifying papers needing additional review"
- **Coarse-grained prediction**: "For binary classification (above/below median), we achieve F1 = X, enabling practical applications like flagging weak submissions"
- **Relative improvement**: "Our approach reduces MAE by X% compared to baselines, translating to Y fewer misclassified papers per 100 submissions"

### 3. **Highlight Specific Successes**

**Disaggregate results:**
- "While overall performance is modest, our model excels at predicting [specific aspect, e.g., 'clarity' or 'soundness'] (R² = X), suggesting that some aspects are more amenable to automated assessment"
- "Performance is strong for extreme cases (top/bottom quartile), where automated screening would be most valuable"
- "Our model shows consistent performance across venues, demonstrating generalizability despite modest absolute gains"

### 4. **Acknowledge Fundamental Challenges**

**Be transparent:**

### On the Difficulty of Aspect Score Prediction

Our models achieve modest gains (MAE reduction of X%), which we attribute to 
three fundamental challenges:

1. **Subjectivity**: Aspect scores reflect individual reviewer preferences and 
   expertise. Inter-reviewer agreement on our dataset is κ = X, indicating 
   substantial legitimate disagreement.

2. **Limited signal**: Aspect scores depend on nuanced judgments (e.g., novelty 
   requires deep domain knowledge) that may not be fully captured by text features 
   alone. External signals (citation networks, author reputation) may be necessary.

3. **Label noise**: Reviewer scores are known to be influenced by non-content 
   factors (reviewer workload, reading order, mood), introducing noise that 
   attenuates model performance.

Despite these challenges, our models provide value for [specific use case], 
and our analysis reveals insights about which aspects are most predictable 
from manuscript text.

## Comprehensive Contingency Plan for Future Work

### **Tier 1: Incremental Improvements (High Feasibility)**

#### A. **Multi-task and Transfer Learning**
- **Rationale**: Aspect scores are correlated; joint prediction may improve performance
- **Experiment**: Train multi-task models that predict all aspects simultaneously with shared representations
- **Expected gain**: 5-15% improvement based on [Multi-task Peer-Review Score Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2020.sdp-1.14.pdf)
- **Fallback**: Even if gains are modest, analyze learned correlations between aspects

#### B. **Incorporate Structured Features**
- **Rationale**: Text alone may be insufficient; structural signals matter
- **Features to add**:
  - Citation graph features (PageRank, citation count)
  - Author features (h-index, prior acceptance rate)
  - Manuscript structure (section lengths, figure/table counts, equation density)
  - Readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid, sentence complexity)
- **Expected gain**: 10-20% improvement
- **Fallback**: Feature ablation reveals which signals are most predictive

#### C. **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**
- **Rationale**: Generic language models may miss domain-specific quality signals
- **Experiment**: Fine-tune SciBERT, SPECTER, or domain-specific BERT on your task
- **Expected gain**: 5-10% over generic BERT
- **Fallback**: Compare learned representations to identify domain-specific patterns

#### D. **Ensemble Methods**
- **Rationale**: Different models may capture complementary signals
- **Experiment**: Ensemble text-based, graph-based, and metadata-based models
- **Expected gain**: 5-10% over best single model
- **Fallback**: Analyze when different models disagree to understand prediction uncertainty

### **Tier 2: Reframing the Problem (Medium Feasibility)**

#### E. **Ordinal Regression Instead of Point Prediction**
- **Rationale**: Predicting score ranges may be more reliable than exact scores
- **Experiment**: Use ordinal regression to predict score bins (low/medium/high)
- **Expected gain**: Higher accuracy for coarse-grained predictions
- **Fallback**: Provides actionable insights even if fine-grained prediction fails

#### F. **Confidence-Aware Prediction**
- **Rationale**: Some papers are easier to score than others
- **Experiment**: Train models to predict both scores and confidence intervals
- **Evaluation**: Measure calibration (are 90% confidence intervals correct 90% of the time?)
- **Value**: Enables selective prediction—only provide scores when confident
- **Fallback**: Uncertainty analysis reveals which papers are hardest to assess

#### G. **Aspect-Specific Models**
- **Rationale**: Different aspects may require different features and architectures
- **Experiment**: Train specialized models for each aspect (e.g., citation-based for novelty, readability-based for clarity)
- **Expected gain**: 10-20% for specific aspects
- **Fallback**: Reveals which aspects are fundamentally more/less predictable

### **Tier 3: Alternative Evaluation Paradigms (High Impact)**

#### H. **Human-AI Collaboration**
- **Reframe**: Don't replace reviewers; augment them
- **Experiment**: 
  - Show reviewers model predictions and measure if it improves consistency
  - Use model to flag potential issues for human verification
  - Measure time savings when reviewers use model assistance
- **Evaluation**: User study with actual reviewers
- **Value**: Demonstrates practical utility even with modest prediction accuracy

#### I. **Comparative Judgment Instead of Absolute Scoring**
- **Rationale**: Humans are better at relative comparisons than absolute ratings
- **Experiment**: Train models to predict pairwise comparisons (is paper A better than B on aspect X?)
- **Expected gain**: Pairwise accuracy often 10-15% higher than absolute prediction
- **Fallback**: Enables ranking applications even if scoring fails

#### J. **Explainable Predictions**
- **Reframe**: Focus on interpretability over accuracy
- **Experiment**: 
  - Extract rationales (which sentences support each aspect score?)
  - Generate natural language explanations for predictions
  - Identify specific weaknesses rather than overall scores
- **Evaluation**: Human evaluation of explanation quality
- **Value**: Provides actionable feedback to authors even if scores are imprecise

### **Tier 4: Data and Label Improvements (Long-term)**

#### K. **Active Learning for Better Labels**
- **Rationale**: Current labels may be noisy; get better ground truth
- **Experiment**: 
  - Use model uncertainty to select papers for re-annotation
  - Collect multiple reviews per paper to estimate true scores
  - Train on consensus scores rather than individual reviewer scores
- **Expected gain**: 15-25% with cleaner labels
- **Timeline**: Requires data collection effort

#### L. **Longitudinal Validation**
- **Rationale**: Aspect scores may not reflect long-term impact
- **Experiment**: Predict future citation count, replication success, or community adoption
- **Evaluation**: Correlate aspect scores with long-term outcomes
- **Value**: Validates (or challenges) the relevance of aspect scores themselves

#### M. **Cross-Venue Transfer Learning**
- **Rationale**: More training data from diverse venues may improve generalization
- **Experiment**: 
  - Pool data from multiple venues in PeerRead
  - Use domain adaptation techniques for venue-specific fine-tuning
  - Test zero-shot transfer to new venues
- **Expected gain**: 10-20% with more diverse training data
- **Fallback**: Reveals venue-specific vs. universal quality signals

### Limitations and Future Directions

**Modest Performance Gains.** Our aspect score prediction models achieve 
[X metric] = [Y value], representing a [Z%] improvement over baselines. 
While modest, this gain is meaningful given the inherent subjectivity of 
peer review. Analysis of inter-reviewer agreement (κ = [value]) suggests 
that a substantial portion of score variance reflects legitimate differences 
in expert opinion rather than predictable patterns.

**Performance Ceiling Analysis.** To contextualize our results, we measured 
the agreement between pairs of reviewers on the same papers. Our model's 
predictions agree with individual reviewers at a rate comparable to inter-
reviewer agreement, suggesting we are approaching the ceiling imposed by 
label noise and subjectivity.

**Aspect-Specific Insights.** Performance varies substantially across aspects: 
[best aspect] achieves [metric] = [value], while [worst aspect] achieves 
[metric] = [value]. This suggests that aspects grounded in objective textual 
features (e.g., clarity, organization) are more amenable to automated 
assessment than those requiring deep domain expertise (e.g., novelty, 
significance).

**Practical Utility.** Despite modest absolute performance, our models 
demonstrate value for [specific use case, e.g., "identifying papers in the 
bottom quartile for additional review" or "providing preliminary feedback 
to authors before submission"]. For binary classification (above/below 
median), we achieve [metric] = [value], which is sufficient for triage 
applications.

**Future Work.** We identify several promising directions:

1. **Multi-task learning**: Jointly predicting correlated aspects may improve 
   performance through shared representations [cite relevant work].

2. **Hybrid models**: Incorporating citation networks, author metadata, and 
   structural features beyond text may capture signals missed by text-only 
   models.

3. **Human-AI collaboration**: Rather than fully automated scoring, our models 
   could augment human reviewers by flagging potential issues or providing 
   preliminary assessments, reducing reviewer workload while maintaining 
   quality.

4. **Alternative tasks**: Pairwise comparison (ranking) or confidence-aware 
   prediction may be more reliable than absolute score prediction.

5. **Label refinement**: Collecting multiple reviews per paper and training 
   on consensus scores may reduce label noise and improve model performance.

We view our work as an important step toward understanding which aspects of 
peer review are amenable to automation, even if full automation remains 
challenging.
