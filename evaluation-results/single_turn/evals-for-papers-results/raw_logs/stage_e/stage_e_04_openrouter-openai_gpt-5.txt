Below is a reviewer-oriented checklist of targeted ablations and error analyses for the PeerRead acceptance classification task, with emphasis on hand-engineered features. I also include concrete, falsifiable experiments and a couple of literature anchors.

Targeted ablations reviewers will expect
- Feature-family leave-one-group-out ablations
  - Length/verbosity proxies: document length, sentence count, reference count, figure/table counts.
  - Structure/format: presence/length of sections (abstract, intro, related work, acknowledgments), heading entropy, equation/URL counts.
  - Lexical/statistical: n-gram, readability, perplexity, entity counts.
  - Metadata-esque cues: year/venue tokens in text, arXiv comments, DOI/“Accepted at …” strings.
  - Report ΔAUC/ΔF1 and bootstrapped CIs for each group; quantify the marginal utility of hand-engineered features beyond text-only baselines [1].  
- Anti-leakage ablations
  - Strip or mask: acknowledgments, camera-ready boilerplate (“We thank…,” grant numbers), venue names, arXiv IDs/comments, and explicit acceptance statements.
  - Compare earliest-available submission-like versions (OpenReview originals or arXiv v1) vs. camera-ready; require stability of results across versions [1].  
- Section-restricted inputs
  - Train/evaluate with: abstract-only; abstract+intro; intro-only; methods-only; title+abstract. This isolates where signal resides and guards against parser-driven artifacts [1].
- Mask citation patterns
  - Replace in-text citations and reference lists with placeholders to remove “citation-density” and venue-name leakage; assess the drop in performance (if any).  
- Text-only vs. features-only vs. combined
  - Train: (a) text-only model, (b) hand-engineered features only, (c) concatenated. Quantify the incremental contribution of features and test whether gains persist OOD [1][4].
- Controlled comparisons on confounders
  - Length/topic matching: evaluate on matched pairs of papers (within venue-year, similar length/topic) to test whether gains persist when common confounds are controlled.
- Cross-venue/year robustness
  - Train on ACL-YY, test on ACL-YY+1 and ICLR-YY (and vice versa) to check whether hand-engineered feature gains are brittle to drift [1].
- Parser/format sensitivity
  - Re-run on a “clean parsing” slice (high token recovery; consistent section detection) and on normalized text (e.g., strip LaTeX artifacts), to ensure results are not parser-specific.

Error analyses to preempt critiques
- Attribution and spurious-cue audit
  - For feature models: SHAP permutation or leave-one-feature-out importance to identify whether length or section presence dominates.
  - For text models: token-level saliency; check for reliance on venue names, “Camera-ready,” or acknowledgments.
- Stratified error breakdowns
  - Error rates by venue, year, length quartile, topic cluster, parser-quality bin; highlight where hand-engineered features help/hurt most.
- Version-difference audit
  - On papers with multiple versions, compare predictions and features between earliest and final versions to quantify leakage risk.
- Hard-case typology
  - Manually inspect 50–100 false positives/negatives; categorize failure modes (e.g., short but strong papers; long but meandering; topic drift; parsing failures) and map them to feature groups.
- Calibration and threshold analysis
  - Reliability curves and expected calibration error by model type (text vs. features vs. combined) to assess decision usefulness (not only ranking).

Concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Leave-one-group-out feature ablation with CIs
- Setup: Define 4–6 feature families (length, structure, lexical/readability, citations, metadata cues). Train a strong text baseline and a combined model on ACL- and ICLR-style splits.
- Metric: AUC on a gold, paper-level held-out set with 1,000+ examples. 1,000× bootstrap for 95% CIs.
- Criterion: If removing “length/verbosity” features erases ≥50% of the combined model’s gain over text-only and CI excludes 0, conclude confounding; otherwise, claim stable incremental value.

2) Anti-leakage masking and version control
- Setup: Create three inputs per paper: camera-ready, camera-ready with masked cues (acknowledgments, venue/DOI/arXiv fields, explicit acceptance strings), and earliest submission-like version (OpenReview original or arXiv v1).
- Metric: ΔAUC between camera-ready vs. masked and between camera-ready vs. earliest version.
- Criterion: If either masking or reverting to earliest version reduces AUC by >0.01 (95% CI excludes 0), label prior gains as partially driven by leakage and report masked/earliest results as primary [1].

3) Section-specific signal localization
- Setup: Train text-only and features+text models on abstract-only, abstract+intro, intro-only subsets; control for total token budget.
- Metric: AUC and retained-performance ratio (subset/full).
- Criterion: If retained performance on abstract+intro ≥0.9 of full-text while features contribute ≤0.01 AUC on that subset, prioritize section-focused modeling over more features.

4) Masked citations and venue tokens
- Setup: Replace all citation markers and reference section with placeholders; strip venue names and arXiv IDs/comments.
- Metric: AUC change and feature importance shift.
- Criterion: If ΔAUC >0.01 or top features shift from content to structure, document the leakage risk and keep citation/venue masking in all main experiments.

5) Cross-venue/year OOD retention
- Setup: Train on ACL-YY, test on ICLR-YY and ACL-YY+1, and vice versa; compare text-only vs. features-only vs. combined.
- Metric: OOD retention = AUC_OOD / AUC_ID.
- Criterion: Require retention ≥0.85 for any claimed feature benefit; if combined < text-only retention, conclude features hurt generalization and down-weight or drop them.

6) Length/topic matched-pairs test
- Setup: Within each venue-year, form pairs matched on length (±5%), topic cluster (e.g., SBERT topic embedding NN), and parser quality; predict which is accepted.
- Metric: Pairwise accuracy and sign test across pairs.
- Criterion: If pairwise accuracy ≤55% or CI overlaps 50%, treat previous gains as largely confounded by easy correlates; otherwise, claim residual signal beyond confounders.

Reporting tips reviewers expect
- Always report paper-level (not review-level) metrics with cluster-robust SEs where multiple reviews exist.
- Pre-register ablation groups and non-inferiority margins; avoid post-hoc regrouping.
- Release feature definitions, masking regexes, and version hashes to ensure reproducibility.
