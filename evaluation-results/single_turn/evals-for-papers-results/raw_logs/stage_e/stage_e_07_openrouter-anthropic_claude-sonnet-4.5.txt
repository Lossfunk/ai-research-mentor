## Rebuttal Response (Concise Version)

```markdown
**Response to Reviewer X: Missing LLM Comparisons**

We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We acknowledge that our 
work does not include comparisons to large language models (LLMs), which 
represent the current state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. We address this 
gap as follows:

**1. Temporal Context**
Our work was conducted in [2017-2018], when the PeerRead dataset was released, 
predating the LLM era (GPT-3: 2020, ChatGPT: 2022). Our baselines reflect 
the state-of-the-art at the time: BERT-base (2018), SciBERT (2019), and 
traditional feature-based models.

**2. Immediate Contribution**
Despite lacking LLM comparisons, our work provides value:
- **Feature analysis**: Identifies which hand-engineered features matter 
  (transferable insights regardless of model architecture)
- **Aspect-level analysis**: Shows which aspects are predictable from text 
  (relevant for any model)
- **Dataset analysis**: Characterizes label quality and venue differences 
  (foundational for future work)
- **Methodology**: Establishes evaluation protocols applicable to LLMs

**3. Preliminary LLM Evaluation (New)**
To address this gap, we have conducted preliminary experiments with GPT-3.5 
and GPT-4 [if feasible] / propose the following evaluation plan [if not]:

[See detailed experiments below]

**4. Commitment to Future Work**
We commit to:
- Comprehensive LLM evaluation within 3 months (technical report)
- Public release of prompts, predictions, and analysis
- Updated leaderboard on project website

We believe our current contribution remains valuable as a foundation, and we 
welcome the opportunity to extend it with LLM comparisons.

### X.X Missing Comparisons to Large Language Models

**Limitation.** Our work does not include comparisons to large language 
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, or Llama-2. This represents 
a significant gap given LLMs' strong performance on many NLP tasks.

**Temporal Context.** Our work was conducted in 2017-2018, when the PeerRead 
dataset was released. At that time, the state-of-the-art for text 
classification included:
- Feature-based models (SVM, logistic regression with hand-engineered features)
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Early neural models (LSTMs, CNNs)
- BERT-base (released October 2018)

The LLM era began with GPT-3 (2020) and accelerated with ChatGPT (2022), 
InstructGPT (2022), and GPT-4 (2023). Our baselines reflect the state-of-
the-art at the time of dataset release.

**Why This Still Matters.** Despite lacking LLM comparisons, our work provides 
foundational insights:

1. **Feature importance analysis**: Our identification of predictive features 
   (clarity metrics, structural features, etc.) provides interpretable insights 
   that complement black-box LLM predictions.

2. **Aspect-level difficulty**: Our finding that clarity is more predictable 
   than novelty applies regardless of model architecture and guides LLM 
   evaluation.

3. **Dataset characterization**: Our analysis of label noise, venue differences, 
   and temporal drift is essential for interpreting any model's performance, 
   including LLMs.

4. **Evaluation methodology**: Our protocols for cross-venue transfer, temporal 
   validation, and error analysis apply equally to LLMs.

**Preliminary LLM Evaluation.** To partially address this gap, we have 
conducted preliminary experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 [if feasible]. 
Results are summarized in Table X and discussed below.

[See Experiment 1 below]

**Future Work.** We are conducting comprehensive LLM evaluation and commit 
to releasing results within 3 months as a technical report. Our evaluation 
plan is detailed in Section X.X.

## Preliminary LLM Experiments (If You Can Run Them)

### **Experiment 1: Zero-Shot LLM Evaluation (ESSENTIAL)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Test GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on PeerRead acceptance prediction

prompt_template = """
You are an expert peer reviewer. Based on the following paper abstract and 
introduction, predict whether this paper would be ACCEPTED or REJECTED at 
a top-tier machine learning conference.

Title: {title}

Abstract: {abstract}

Introduction: {introduction}

Prediction (ACCEPTED or REJECTED):
"""

# Run on test set
for paper in test_set:
    prompt = prompt_template.format(
        title=paper.title,
        abstract=paper.abstract,
        introduction=paper.introduction
    )
    prediction = query_llm(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
    # Also try gpt-4, claude-2, llama-2-70b
```

**Present as:**

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 | Accuracy | Cost per 1K papers | Inference Time |
|-------|-----------|--------|----|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Traditional Models** |
| Logistic Reg + Features | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $0 | <1 min |
| BERT-base | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $0 | 5 min |
| SciBERT | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $0 | 5 min |
| **LLMs (Zero-Shot)** |
| GPT-3.5-turbo | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $2-5 | 30 min |
| GPT-4 | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $30-50 | 60 min |
| Claude-2 | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $10-20 | 45 min |
| Llama-2-70B | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | $0 (self-hosted) | 120 min |

**Interpretation scenarios:**

**Scenario A: LLMs substantially outperform (ΔF1 > 0.10)**
```markdown
**LLM Performance.** Zero-shot GPT-4 achieves F1 = X.XX, substantially 
outperforming our best model (F1 = Y.YY, ΔF1 = Z.ZZ). This demonstrates 
that LLMs' broad pretraining and reasoning capabilities provide significant 
advantages for peer review prediction.

However, LLMs come with trade-offs:
- **Cost**: GPT-4 costs ~$40 per 1,000 papers vs. $0 for our models
- **Latency**: GPT-4 requires ~60 minutes vs. <5 minutes for BERT
- **Interpretability**: LLM predictions are opaque vs. our feature-based 
  analysis
- **Reproducibility**: API models may change over time vs. fixed model weights

**Complementary Value.** Our feature analysis reveals *why* papers are 
accepted (clarity, soundness, etc.), while LLMs provide *what* predictions. 
Both perspectives are valuable: LLMs for accuracy, our models for 
interpretability.
```

**Scenario B: LLMs moderately outperform (ΔF1 = 0.03-0.10)**
```markdown
**LLM Performance.** Zero-shot GPT-4 achieves F1 = X.XX, moderately 
outperforming our best model (F1 = Y.YY, ΔF1 = Z.ZZ). This improvement is 
statistically significant (p < 0.05, McNemar's test) but comes at substantial 
cost (~$40 per 1,000 papers vs. $0).

**Cost-Benefit Analysis.** For applications requiring maximum accuracy 
(e.g., high-stakes decisions), GPT-4's improvement may justify the cost. 
For large-scale screening or research applications, our models provide 
competitive performance at zero marginal cost.

**Hybrid Approach.** A two-stage system (our model for initial screening, 
GPT-4 for borderline cases) could achieve 95% of GPT-4's performance at 
20% of the cost.
```

**Scenario C: LLMs comparable or worse (ΔF1 < 0.03)**
```markdown
**LLM Performance.** Surprisingly, zero-shot GPT-4 achieves F1 = X.XX, 
comparable to our best model (F1 = Y.YY, ΔF1 = Z.ZZ, not statistically 
significant). This suggests that peer review prediction requires domain-
specific training rather than general reasoning capabilities.

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Domain specificity**: Peer review requires understanding of ML/AI 
   research norms not well-represented in LLM pretraining
2. **Subtle signals**: Acceptance depends on nuanced quality signals that 
   LLMs struggle to detect from text alone
3. **Prompt engineering**: Our zero-shot prompts may be suboptimal; few-shot 
   or chain-of-thought prompting may improve performance

**Implication.** Domain-specific models (like ours) remain competitive with 
general-purpose LLMs for specialized tasks like peer review prediction.
```

### **Experiment 2: Few-Shot LLM Evaluation (RECOMMENDED)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Provide examples in the prompt

few_shot_prompt = """
You are an expert peer reviewer. Here are examples of papers and their outcomes:

Example 1 (ACCEPTED):
Title: {accepted_title_1}
Abstract: {accepted_abstract_1}
Outcome: ACCEPTED
Reasoning: Novel approach, strong empirical results, clear presentation

Example 2 (REJECTED):
Title: {rejected_title_1}
Abstract: {rejected_abstract_1}
Outcome: REJECTED
Reasoning: Incremental contribution, weak baselines, unclear methodology

Example 3 (ACCEPTED):
[...]

Now predict for this paper:
Title: {test_title}
Abstract: {test_abstract}

Prediction (ACCEPTED or REJECTED) and reasoning:
"""

# Test with different numbers of examples
for n_examples in [0, 1, 3, 5, 10]:
    performance[n_examples] = evaluate_few_shot(n_examples)
```

**Present as:**

| Model | 0-shot | 1-shot | 3-shot | 5-shot | 10-shot | Improvement |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| GPT-3.5-turbo | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | +Y.YY |
| GPT-4 | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | +Y.YY |
| Claude-2 | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | +Y.YY |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Few-Shot Learning.** Providing 5 examples improves GPT-4 performance from 
F1 = X.XX (zero-shot) to F1 = Y.YY (5-shot), a gain of Z.ZZ. This suggests 
that LLMs benefit from task-specific examples, similar to traditional 
supervised learning.

**Diminishing Returns.** Performance plateaus beyond 5 examples, suggesting 
that additional examples provide minimal benefit. This is consistent with 
LLM in-context learning literature.

**Comparison to Fine-Tuning.** Our fine-tuned BERT model (F1 = W.WW) still 
outperforms 5-shot GPT-4 (F1 = Y.YY), suggesting that full fine-tuning on 
1,000+ examples provides advantages over few-shot prompting.
```

---

### **Experiment 3: Aspect Score Prediction with LLMs (COMPREHENSIVE)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Test LLMs on aspect score prediction (not just binary classification)

aspect_prompt = """
You are an expert peer reviewer. Rate the following paper on these aspects 
(scale 1-5):

1. Clarity: Is the paper well-written and easy to understand?
2. Soundness: Are the methods and experiments technically sound?
3. Novelty: Does the paper present novel ideas or approaches?
4. Significance: Is the contribution important to the field?
5. Reproducibility: Can the results be reproduced from the description?

Title: {title}
Abstract: {abstract}
Introduction: {introduction}

Provide scores (1-5) for each aspect:
"""

# Compare to your aspect score models
for aspect in ['clarity', 'soundness', 'novelty', 'significance']:
    llm_performance[aspect] = evaluate_llm_aspect(aspect)
    baseline_performance[aspect] = your_model_performance[aspect]
```

**Present as:**

| Aspect | Your Model (MAE) | GPT-4 (MAE) | ΔMAE | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------|-------------|------|----------------|
| Clarity | 0.XX | 0.YY | -Z.ZZ | **LLM better** |
| Soundness | 0.XX | 0.YY | -Z.ZZ | **LLM better** |
| Novelty | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | **Your model better** |
| Significance | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | **Your model better** |
| Reproducibility | 0.XX | 0.YY | -Z.ZZ | **LLM better** |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Aspect-Level Performance.** LLMs excel at predicting objective aspects 
(clarity, soundness, reproducibility) but struggle with subjective aspects 
(novelty, significance). This aligns with our finding that objective aspects 
are more predictable from text.

**Complementary Strengths.** LLMs' language understanding helps with clarity 
assessment, while our domain-specific features (citation patterns, topic 
modeling) help with novelty assessment. A hybrid approach could leverage 
both strengths.
```

---

### **Experiment 4: Error Analysis Comparison (INSIGHTFUL)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Compare which papers each model gets wrong

your_model_errors = get_errors(your_model, test_set)
llm_errors = get_errors(gpt4, test_set)

# Categorize errors
overlap_errors = your_model_errors & llm_errors  # Both wrong
your_only_errors = your_model_errors - llm_errors  # You wrong, LLM right
llm_only_errors = llm_errors - your_model_errors  # LLM wrong, you right
```

**Present as:**

| Error Category | Count | % of Test Set | Example Characteristics |
|----------------|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| Both models correct | X | Y% | Clear accepts/rejects |
| Both models wrong | X | Y% | Borderline cases, controversial |
| Your model wrong, LLM right | X | Y% | Complex reasoning, nuanced language |
| LLM wrong, your model right | X | Y% | Domain-specific patterns, citation analysis |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Complementary Errors.** Our model and GPT-4 make different errors on X% 
of test cases, suggesting complementary strengths. Papers where LLMs excel 
tend to require complex reasoning and language understanding, while papers 
where our model excels require domain-specific knowledge and citation analysis.

**Ensemble Potential.** An ensemble combining our model and GPT-4 achieves 
F1 = Z.ZZ, outperforming either model alone (your model: W.WW, GPT-4: V.VV). 
This demonstrates that traditional and LLM approaches provide complementary 
signals.
```

## Alternative: If You Cannot Run LLM Experiments

```markdown
### X.X Missing LLM Comparisons: Limitations and Future Work

**Acknowledged Gap.** Our work does not include comparisons to large language 
models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, or Llama-2. This represents a significant 
limitation given LLMs' strong performance on many NLP tasks.

**Why This Gap Exists.**
1. **Temporal**: Our work was conducted in 2017-2018, predating the LLM era
2. **Resource constraints**: LLM evaluation requires substantial API costs 
   (~$500-1,000) beyond our current budget
3. **Methodological focus**: Our work emphasizes interpretable feature 
   analysis rather than maximum predictive performance

**Why Our Work Still Contributes.**
Despite lacking LLM comparisons, our work provides foundational value:

1. **Feature insights**: We identify which features predict acceptance 
   (clarity, soundness, etc.), providing interpretable insights that 
   complement black-box LLM predictions

2. **Evaluation methodology**: Our protocols for cross-venue transfer, 
   temporal validation, and error analysis apply equally to LLMs and 
   establish baselines for future work

3. **Dataset analysis**: Our characterization of label noise, venue 
   differences, and reviewer variability is essential for interpreting 
   any model's performance

4. **Reproducibility**: Our models are fully reproducible with fixed weights, 
   unlike API-based LLMs that may change over time

**Principled Future Work Plan.**
We propose comprehensive LLM evaluation following the plan in Section X.X:
- **Phase 1** (3 months): Baseline evaluation of GPT-4, Claude-2, Llama-2
- **Phase 2** (3 months): Advanced techniques (fine-tuning, RAG, ensembles)
- **Phase 3** (3 months): Analysis and public release

We commit to releasing all results as a technical report and public dataset, 
regardless of whether LLMs outperform our models.

**Call for Collaboration.**
We invite researchers with LLM access to collaborate on this evaluation. We 
will provide:
- Standardized evaluation protocol
- Train/test splits
- Baseline results for comparison
- Support for result interpretation

Contact: [email] or visit [project website]

**Interim Value.**
While we work toward comprehensive LLM evaluation, our current contribution 
provides:
- Interpretable baselines for the community
- Methodology applicable to any model architecture
- Insights about task difficulty and data quality
- Foundation for future LLM research on peer review
```

## Minimal Viable Response (If Severely Time-Constrained)

```markdown
**Response to Reviewer X: Missing LLM Comparisons**

We acknowledge that our work lacks LLM comparisons. Our work was conducted 
in 2017-2018, predating GPT-3 (2020) and GPT-4 (2023). Our baselines (BERT, 
SciBERT) reflect the state-of-the-art at the time.

Despite this limitation, our work contributes:
1. Feature analysis identifying what predicts acceptance (interpretable)
2. Evaluation methodology applicable to any model, including LLMs
3. Dataset characterization essential for interpreting model performance

We commit to comprehensive LLM evaluation within 3 months:
- Test GPT-4, Claude-2, Llama-2 (zero-shot and few-shot)
- Compare to our models on all metrics
- Release results as technical report with code and prompts
- Update project website with public leaderboard

We have added Section X.X discussing this limitation and future work plan.
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Acknowledge explicitly**: Don't ignore or minimize the missing LLM comparison

2. **Provide temporal context**: Explain that your work predates the LLM era

3. **Emphasize complementary value**: Feature analysis and interpretability matter even if LLMs achieve higher accuracy

4. **Commit to concrete plan**: Specific timeline, models, metrics, and deliverables

5. **Be transparent**: Promise to release results regardless of outcome

6. **Run preliminary experiments if possible**: Even zero-shot GPT-3.5 results show good faith

7. **Frame as opportunity**: LLM evaluation is valuable future work, not just a limitation

The goal is to show that you understand the importance of LLM comparisons, have a principled plan to address the gap, and that your current work still provides value as a foundation.
