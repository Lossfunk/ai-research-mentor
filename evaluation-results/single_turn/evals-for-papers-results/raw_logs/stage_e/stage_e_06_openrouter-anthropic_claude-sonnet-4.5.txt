## Comprehensive Response Framework for Underpowered Labeling Concerns

Here's a structured approach to address concerns about insufficient labeling for newer venues and their impact on generalizability.

---

## Understanding the "Underpowered" Problem

### **The Core Issue:**

PeerRead likely has:
- **NIPS**: Large sample (e.g., 1,000+ papers across multiple years)
- **ICLR**: Smaller sample (e.g., 200-500 papers from 2017 only)
- **arXiv**: Large but noisy labels

This creates several problems:

1. **Statistical power**: Insufficient data to detect true effects
2. **Class imbalance**: May not represent full acceptance rate distribution
3. **Temporal coverage**: Single year doesn't capture venue evolution
4. **Variance estimation**: Confidence intervals are wide
5. **Overfitting risk**: Models may memorize rather than generalize

## Response Template for Discussion Section

### **Opening: Acknowledge the Limitation Explicitly**

```markdown
### X.X Limitations of Venue Coverage

**Unbalanced Venue Representation.** Our dataset contains substantially more 
data from NIPS (N = X papers across Y years) than from ICLR (N = Z papers 
from 2017 only). This imbalance affects our findings in several ways:

1. **Statistical power**: ICLR results have wider confidence intervals (±A.A 
   F1) compared to NIPS (±B.B F1), reducing our ability to detect true effects.

2. **Temporal stability**: Single-year ICLR data cannot capture year-to-year 
   variation in review standards, acceptance rates, or research trends.

3. **Generalizability**: Models trained primarily on NIPS may reflect NIPS-
   specific patterns rather than universal quality signals.

4. **Overfitting risk**: Limited ICLR data increases the risk of overfitting 
   to idiosyncratic features of the 2017 submission pool.

We address these concerns through [specific analyses below] and propose 
concrete follow-up experiments to validate our findings.
```

## Quantifying the Impact

### **Analysis 1: Power Analysis and Sample Size Requirements**

**What to do:**
```python
# Calculate statistical power for current sample sizes
from statsmodels.stats.power import tt_ind_solve_power

# For each venue
venues = {'NIPS': 1000, 'ICLR': 300}  # example sizes

for venue, n in venues.items():
    # Calculate detectable effect size
    effect_size = tt_ind_solve_power(
        n1=n/2,  # accepted papers
        n2=n/2,  # rejected papers
        alpha=0.05,
        power=0.80
    )
    
    # Calculate confidence interval width
    ci_width = 1.96 * sqrt(variance / n)
```

**Present as table:**

| Venue | N Papers | N Accepted | N Rejected | Detectable Effect (Cohen's d) | F1 CI Width | Statistical Power |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| NIPS | 1,200 | 300 | 900 | 0.18 | ±0.03 | **Adequate** (80%) |
| ICLR | 300 | 90 | 210 | 0.36 | ±0.06 | **Underpowered** (45%) |
| arXiv | 5,000 | 0 | 5,000 | 0.08 | ±0.01 | Adequate (but noisy labels) |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Power Analysis.** With N = 300 ICLR papers, we can only detect effect 
sizes of Cohen's d ≥ 0.36 with 80% power, compared to d ≥ 0.18 for NIPS. 
This means subtle but real differences in ICLR may go undetected.

Our F1 confidence intervals for ICLR (±0.06) are 2× wider than for NIPS 
(±0.03), indicating greater uncertainty in ICLR results. Readers should 
interpret ICLR-specific findings with appropriate caution.

**Sample Size Requirements.** To achieve comparable statistical power to 
NIPS, we would need:
- **ICLR**: ~800 papers (current: 300) for 80% power
- **New venues**: ≥500 papers minimum for reliable conclusions
```

---

### **Analysis 2: Learning Curve Analysis**

**What to do:**
```python
# Subsample NIPS data to match ICLR size
# Show how performance degrades with less data

sample_sizes = [50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1200]
results = {}

for size in sample_sizes:
    # Subsample NIPS to this size
    for trial in range(10):  # Multiple trials for stability
        subsample = random_sample(nips_data, size)
        model = train(subsample)
        results[size].append(evaluate(model, nips_test))
```

**Visualization:** Learning curve showing F1 vs. training set size

**Present as:**

| Training Size | NIPS F1 (mean ± std) | ICLR F1 (mean ± std) | Performance Gap |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 50 | 0.XX ± 0.YY | 0.XX ± 0.YY | -Z.ZZ |
| 100 | 0.XX ± 0.YY | 0.XX ± 0.YY | -Z.ZZ |
| 200 | 0.XX ± 0.YY | 0.XX ± 0.YY | -Z.ZZ |
| 300 | 0.XX ± 0.YY | **0.XX ± 0.YY** | -Z.ZZ |
| 500 | 0.XX ± 0.YY | N/A | N/A |
| 800 | 0.XX ± 0.YY | N/A | N/A |
| 1200 | **0.XX ± 0.YY** | N/A | N/A |

**Critical insights:**
```markdown
**Learning Curve Analysis.** When we subsample NIPS to match ICLR's size 
(N = 300), NIPS performance drops from F1 = X.XX to F1 = Y.YY, a gap of 
Z.ZZ. This suggests that ICLR's lower performance (F1 = W.WW) may be partly 
due to insufficient training data rather than fundamental differences in 
predictability.

The learning curve shows diminishing returns beyond ~800 papers, suggesting 
this is a reasonable target for future data collection.

**Variance Analysis.** At N = 300, performance variance is ±0.06 (10 trials), 
compared to ±0.02 at N = 1200. This 3× increase in variance explains the 
wider confidence intervals for ICLR results.
```

---

### **Analysis 3: Temporal Stability Assessment**

**What to do:**
```python
# For NIPS (multi-year data), test year-to-year stability
# This shows what we're missing for ICLR

years = [2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017]
results = {}

for test_year in years:
    train_years = [y for y in years if y != test_year]
    model = train(nips_data[train_years])
    results[test_year] = evaluate(model, nips_data[test_year])
```

**Present as:**

| Test Year | F1 | ΔF1 from Mean | Acceptance Rate | Avg Paper Length | Topic Shift |
|-----------|----|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 2013 | 0.XX | +Y.YY | 24% | 8.2 pages | Baseline |
| 2014 | 0.XX | +Y.YY | 23% | 8.4 pages | Low |
| 2015 | 0.XX | +Y.YY | 22% | 8.6 pages | Medium |
| 2016 | 0.XX | +Y.YY | 21% | 8.8 pages | Medium |
| 2017 | 0.XX | +Y.YY | 20% | 9.1 pages | High |
| **Std Dev** | **±Z.ZZ** | - | - | - | - |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Temporal Variance in NIPS.** Year-to-year performance varies by ±Z.ZZ F1 
points, indicating that single-year samples (like our ICLR data) may not be 
representative of the venue's typical patterns.

The 2017 NIPS data shows the largest deviation (ΔF1 = -W.WW), coinciding 
with a shift toward deep learning topics. This suggests that our 2017 ICLR 
data may similarly reflect year-specific trends rather than stable venue 
characteristics.

**Implication for ICLR.** Without multi-year ICLR data, we cannot determine 
whether our ICLR findings reflect:
- Stable ICLR review patterns (generalizable)
- 2017-specific trends (not generalizable)
- Idiosyncrasies of the 2017 submission pool (noise)

This uncertainty limits our ability to make strong claims about ICLR-specific 
patterns.
```

---

### **Analysis 4: Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**

**What to do:**
```python
# Calculate robust confidence intervals via bootstrapping

def bootstrap_ci(data, model_fn, n_iterations=1000):
    results = []
    for i in range(n_iterations):
        sample = resample(data, replace=True)
        model = model_fn(sample)
        results.append(evaluate(model, test_data))
    
    return percentile(results, [2.5, 97.5])

# For each venue
nips_ci = bootstrap_ci(nips_data, train_model)
iclr_ci = bootstrap_ci(iclr_data, train_model)
```

**Present as:**

| Venue | Point Estimate | 95% CI | CI Width | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| NIPS | F1 = 0.XX | [0.YY, 0.ZZ] | 0.AA | **Narrow** (high confidence) |
| ICLR | F1 = 0.XX | [0.YY, 0.ZZ] | 0.BB | **Wide** (low confidence) |

**Visualization:** Forest plot showing point estimates with error bars

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Confidence Interval Analysis.** ICLR's 95% CI is 2.5× wider than NIPS's 
(0.BB vs. 0.AA), reflecting greater uncertainty due to smaller sample size. 

Critically, the ICLR confidence interval overlaps substantially with NIPS 
[0.YY, 0.ZZ] vs. [0.WW, 0.VV], suggesting we cannot confidently conclude 
that ICLR is more/less predictable than NIPS.

**Statistical Significance.** Differences between NIPS and ICLR are not 
statistically significant (p = 0.XX, permutation test), likely due to 
insufficient ICLR sample size rather than true equivalence.
```

---

### **Analysis 5: Stratified Sampling Adequacy**

**What to do:**
```python
# Check if ICLR sample represents key strata adequately

strata = ['topic', 'acceptance_decision', 'paper_length', 'author_count']

for stratum in strata:
    # Count samples per category
    counts = iclr_data.groupby(stratum).size()
    
    # Flag underpowered strata (n < 30)
    underpowered = counts[counts < 30]
```

**Present as:**

| Stratum | Category | NIPS N | ICLR N | Adequate? | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Topic** | Deep Learning | 450 | 120 | ✓ Yes | Can analyze |
| | Reinforcement Learning | 180 | 35 | ⚠ Marginal | Limited power |
| | Theory | 120 | 15 | ✗ No | Cannot analyze |
| | Applications | 200 | 45 | ⚠ Marginal | Limited power |
| **Decision** | Clear Accept | 150 | 25 | ✗ No | Cannot analyze |
| | Borderline Accept | 150 | 65 | ⚠ Marginal | Limited power |
| | Borderline Reject | 600 | 150 | ✓ Yes | Can analyze |
| | Clear Reject | 300 | 60 | ⚠ Marginal | Limited power |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Stratification Analysis.** ICLR has adequate sample sizes (n ≥ 50) for 
only 2 of 8 key strata, compared to 8 of 8 for NIPS. This limits our ability 
to:
- Analyze topic-specific patterns in ICLR
- Study borderline vs. clear decisions separately
- Detect interaction effects

**Most Critical Gap.** ICLR has only 15 theory papers, preventing meaningful 
analysis of this important subfield. Claims about "ICLR patterns" may 
actually reflect "ICLR deep learning patterns."
```

## Concrete Follow-Up Experiments (Reassurance for Reviewers)

### **Experiment 1: Expanded ICLR Data Collection (MOST REASSURING)**

**Proposal:**
```markdown
### Follow-Up Experiment 1: Multi-Year ICLR Validation

**Objective:** Collect ICLR data from 2018-2024 to achieve comparable 
statistical power to NIPS.

**Data Collection Plan:**
- Target: 800 ICLR papers (400 accepted, 400 rejected)
- Years: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024
- Source: OpenReview (publicly available reviews and decisions)
- Timeline: 2-3 months for collection and annotation

**Validation Strategy:**
1. **Temporal stability**: Test if 2017 findings replicate in 2018-2024
2. **Learning curve validation**: Confirm that performance improves with 
   more data as predicted
3. **Confidence interval reduction**: Achieve CI width ≤ 0.03 (matching NIPS)
4. **Stratified analysis**: Enable topic-specific and decision-specific 
   analyses

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **If 2017 findings replicate**: Validates current conclusions, increases 
  confidence
- **If 2017 findings don't replicate**: Identifies year-specific artifacts, 
  refines conclusions
- **Either way**: Provides more robust foundation for future work

**Commitment:** We commit to releasing this expanded dataset and updated 
results within 6 months of publication.
```

**Why this reassures reviewers:**
- Shows you understand the limitation
- Provides concrete, achievable plan
- Demonstrates commitment to validation
- Uses publicly available data (feasible)

---

### **Experiment 2: Cross-Validation with Held-Out Years (IMMEDIATE)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Use NIPS multi-year data to simulate ICLR's single-year limitation

# Scenario 1: Train on single year, test on others
for year in [2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017]:
    model = train(nips_data[year])
    for test_year in [2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017]:
        if test_year != year:
            performance[year][test_year] = evaluate(model, nips_data[test_year])

# Scenario 2: Train on all years except one, test on held-out
for held_out_year in [2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017]:
    train_years = [y for y in years if y != held_out_year]
    model = train(nips_data[train_years])
    performance[held_out_year] = evaluate(model, nips_data[held_out_year])
```

**Present as:**

**Scenario 1: Single-Year Training (simulates ICLR limitation)**

| Train Year | Test on 2013 | Test on 2014 | Test on 2015 | Test on 2016 | Test on 2017 | Avg Transfer |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 2013 | 0.XX | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.ZZ |
| 2014 | 0.YY | 0.XX | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.ZZ |
| 2015 | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.XX | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.ZZ |
| 2016 | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.XX | 0.YY | 0.ZZ |
| 2017 | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.YY | 0.XX | 0.ZZ |

**Scenario 2: Leave-One-Year-Out (best practice)**

| Held-Out Year | F1 (multi-year train) | F1 (single-year train) | Improvement |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 2013 | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ |
| 2014 | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ |
| 2015 | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ |
| 2016 | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ |
| 2017 | 0.XX | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Single-Year Limitation Impact.** When we train on a single NIPS year and 
test on other years (simulating ICLR's limitation), performance drops by 
X.XX F1 on average compared to multi-year training. This suggests our ICLR 
results may underestimate true performance by ~X%.

**Year-Specific Variance.** Single-year models show high variance (σ = Y.YY) 
in cross-year transfer, with 2017 showing the largest deviation. This 
confirms that single-year samples (like ICLR 2017) are unreliable indicators 
of venue-level patterns.

**Implication:** Our ICLR findings should be interpreted as "2017 ICLR 
patterns" rather than "ICLR patterns generally." Multi-year validation is 
essential for robust conclusions.
```

**Why this reassures reviewers:**
- Uses existing data (no new collection needed)
- Quantifies the impact of single-year limitation
- Shows you understand the problem
- Provides bounds on uncertainty

---

### **Experiment 3: Synthetic Data Augmentation (CREATIVE)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Use data augmentation to simulate larger ICLR sample

augmentation_methods = [
    'paraphrase_abstract',  # Use back-translation or paraphrasing
    'synonym_replacement',  # Replace words with synonyms
    'sentence_reordering',  # Shuffle sentence order
    'mixup',  # Interpolate between examples
    'bootstrap_sampling'  # Resample with replacement
]

for method in augmentation_methods:
    augmented_data = augment(iclr_data, method, target_size=800)
    model = train(augmented_data)
    performance[method] = evaluate(model, iclr_test)
```

**Present as:**

| Augmentation Method | Augmented Size | F1 | ΔF1 from Original | Overfitting Risk |
|---------------------|----------------|----|--------------------|------------------|
| Original (no augmentation) | 300 | 0.XX | - | Baseline |
| Bootstrap sampling | 800 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Low |
| Synonym replacement | 800 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Low |
| Paraphrase (back-translation) | 800 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Medium |
| Sentence reordering | 800 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Medium |
| Mixup | 800 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | High |

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Data Augmentation Analysis.** Augmenting ICLR data to 800 samples improves 
F1 by X.XX on average, approaching the performance of models trained on 
larger NIPS samples. This suggests that insufficient data (not fundamental 
unpredictability) explains ICLR's lower performance.

**Validation:** We validate augmented models on held-out real ICLR data to 
ensure augmentation doesn't introduce artifacts. Bootstrap sampling shows 
the most reliable gains with lowest overfitting risk.

**Caveat:** Augmentation cannot replace real data collection but provides 
preliminary evidence that larger ICLR samples would improve performance.
```

**Why this reassures reviewers:**
- Shows proactive problem-solving
- Provides preliminary evidence for data size hypothesis
- Demonstrates technical sophistication
- Acknowledges limitations of synthetic data

---

### **Experiment 4: Transfer Learning from NIPS to ICLR (PRACTICAL)**

**What to do:**
```python
# Test if pre-training on NIPS helps with limited ICLR data

# Baseline: Train only on ICLR
model_iclr_only = train(iclr_data)
f1_iclr_only = evaluate(model_iclr_only, iclr_test)

# Transfer: Pre-train on NIPS, fine-tune on ICLR
model_transfer = pretrain(nips_data)
model_transfer = finetune(model_transfer, iclr_data)
f1_transfer = evaluate(model_transfer, iclr_test)

# Vary ICLR fine-tuning size
for iclr_size in [50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300]:
    model = pretrain(nips_data)
    model = finetune(model, iclr_data[:iclr_size])
    performance[iclr_size] = evaluate(model, iclr_test)
```

**Present as:**

| Training Strategy | ICLR Training Size | F1 | ΔF1 from ICLR-only | Interpretation |
|-------------------|-------------------|----|--------------------|----------------|
| ICLR only | 300 | 0.XX | - | Baseline (underpowered) |
| NIPS → ICLR transfer | 300 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | **Transfer helps** |
| NIPS → ICLR transfer | 200 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Matches baseline with less data |
| NIPS → ICLR transfer | 100 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Still competitive |
| NIPS → ICLR transfer | 50 | 0.YY | +Z.ZZ | Degrades but usable |

**Visualization:** Learning curve comparing ICLR-only vs. transfer learning

**Interpretation:**
```markdown
**Transfer Learning Mitigates Data Scarcity.** Pre-training on NIPS and 
fine-tuning on ICLR improves F1 by X.XX over ICLR-only training. Remarkably, 
transfer learning with only 200 ICLR papers matches the performance of 
ICLR-only training with 300 papers.

This demonstrates that:
1. NIPS and ICLR share sufficient commonalities for transfer
2. Limited ICLR data can be partially compensated by leveraging NIPS
3. Our current ICLR results likely underestimate achievable performance

**Practical Implication:** For new venues with limited data, transfer 
learning from well-represented venues (like NIPS) is a viable strategy.
```

**Why this reassures reviewers:**
- Provides immediate improvement without new data
- Demonstrates cross-venue knowledge transfer
- Shows you're using best practices (transfer learning)
- Offers practical solution for future venues

---

### **Experiment 5: External Validation on ACL or Other Venues (GOLD STANDARD)**

**Proposal:**
```markdown
### Follow-Up Experiment 5: External Validation

**Objective:** Test generalizability on completely independent venue (ACL, 
CVPR, or ICML) to validate that findings aren't NIPS/ICLR-specific.

**Data Collection:**
- **Option 1 (ACL)**: Use ACL Anthology + OpenReview for recent years
- **Option 2 (ICML)**: Similar to NIPS, provides strong comparison
- **Option 3 (CVPR)**: Tests transfer to vision domain
- Target: 500+ papers with reviews and decisions

**Validation Questions:**
1. Do NIPS-trained models transfer to external venue?
2. Do aspect-level patterns (clarity transfers, novelty doesn't) replicate?
3. Do feature importance rankings remain consistent?
4. Does transfer learning improve performance?

**Timeline:** 3-6 months for data collection and analysis

**Commitment:** We will release results as a follow-up technical report or 
workshop paper, regardless of outcome.
```

**Why this reassures reviewers:**
- Shows commitment to rigorous validation
- Tests generalizability beyond ML/AI
- Demonstrates scientific integrity (commit to releasing negative results)
- Provides path to broader impact

## Recommended Discussion Section Structure

```markdown
### X.X Limitations: Underpowered Venue Coverage

**Unbalanced Dataset.** Our dataset contains substantially more NIPS data 
(N = 1,200 papers, 2013-2017) than ICLR data (N = 300 papers, 2017 only). 
This imbalance creates several limitations:

#### Statistical Power
Power analysis (Table X) shows that ICLR has only 45% power to detect 
moderate effects (Cohen's d = 0.36), compared to 80% for NIPS. This means 
subtle but real patterns in ICLR may go undetected, and null findings should 
be interpreted as "insufficient evidence" rather than "no effect."

Our ICLR confidence intervals are 2.5× wider than NIPS (±0.06 vs. ±0.03), 
reflecting greater uncertainty. Differences between NIPS and ICLR are not 
statistically significant (p = 0.XX), likely due to insufficient power rather 
than true equivalence.

#### Temporal Stability
Single-year ICLR data cannot capture year-to-year variation. Analysis of 
NIPS across years (Table Y) shows performance variance of ±Z.ZZ F1, suggesting 
that 2017 ICLR may not represent typical ICLR patterns.

Leave-one-year-out validation (Section X.X) shows that single-year training 
reduces performance by X.XX F1 compared to multi-year training, suggesting 
our ICLR results may underestimate true performance.

#### Stratification Adequacy
ICLR has adequate sample sizes (n ≥ 50) for only 2 of 8 key strata (Table Z), 
preventing topic-specific and decision-specific analyses. Claims about "ICLR 
patterns" may actually reflect "ICLR deep learning patterns" due to limited 
topic diversity.

#### Impact on Conclusions
These limitations affect our conclusions as follows:

**Strong claims (well-supported):**
- NIPS-specific findings (adequate power)
- Cross-venue patterns that replicate in both NIPS and ICLR
- Qualitative insights about feature importance

**Weak claims (underpowered):**
- ICLR-specific findings (insufficient power)
- Quantitative comparisons between NIPS and ICLR
- Topic-specific patterns in ICLR

**Revised claims:** We have revised our manuscript to distinguish between 
well-powered (NIPS) and underpowered (ICLR) findings, using language like 
"preliminary evidence" and "suggestive but not conclusive" for ICLR-specific 
claims.

### X.X Validation Strategy and Follow-Up Work

To address these limitations, we propose and partially implement the following 
validation strategy:

#### Immediate Validation (Included in This Paper)
1. **Learning curve analysis** (Section X.X): Quantifies impact of limited 
   data
2. **Bootstrap confidence intervals** (Section X.X): Provides robust 
   uncertainty estimates
3. **Transfer learning** (Section X.X): Mitigates data scarcity
4. **Leave-one-year-out validation** (Section X.X): Simulates single-year 
   limitation

#### Committed Follow-Up (Within 6 Months)
1. **Expanded ICLR data collection**: Target 800 papers from 2018-2024 via 
   OpenReview
2. **Multi-year validation**: Test if 2017 findings replicate
3. **Updated results release**: Public dataset and revised conclusions

#### Proposed Future Work (12-18 Months)
1. **External validation**: Test on ACL, ICML, or CVPR (500+ papers)
2. **Cross-domain transfer**: Quantify generalizability limits
3. **Longitudinal study**: Track venue evolution over time

We commit to releasing all follow-up results publicly, regardless of whether 
they support or contradict our current findings. This commitment to 
transparency ensures that our work contributes to cumulative scientific 
knowledge even if initial conclusions require revision.

## Rebuttal-Specific Response

```markdown
**Response to Reviewer X: Underpowered ICLR Sample**

We thank the reviewer for this important observation. We agree that our ICLR 
sample (N = 300, single year) is underpowered compared to NIPS (N = 1,200, 
five years). We have addressed this in three ways:

**1. Quantified the Impact (New Analysis)**
We conducted power analysis showing that ICLR has only 45% power to detect 
moderate effects, compared to 80% for NIPS. We also performed learning curve 
analysis demonstrating that single-year training reduces performance by X.XX 
F1 compared to multi-year training. These analyses are now included in 
Section X.X.

**2. Revised Claims (Throughout Paper)**
We have revised our claims to distinguish between well-powered (NIPS) and 
underpowered (ICLR) findings:
- Abstract: Changed "our models predict aspect scores" → "our models predict 
  aspect scores for NIPS; preliminary evidence suggests similar patterns for 
  ICLR"
- Results: Added confidence intervals and power calculations for all ICLR 
  findings
- Discussion: Added Section X.X explicitly discussing this limitation

**3. Proposed Validation (New Section X.X)**
We propose concrete follow-up experiments:
- **Immediate**: Transfer learning from NIPS to ICLR (improves F1 by X.XX, 
  now included)
- **6 months**: Expanded ICLR data collection (target: 800 papers, 2018-2024)
- **12 months**: External validation on ACL/ICML (500+ papers)

We commit to releasing all follow-up results publicly.

**Why This Paper Still Makes a Contribution:**
Despite ICLR's limited sample, our work provides:
1. Robust findings for NIPS (well-powered)
2. Methodology applicable to other venues
3. Preliminary evidence for ICLR (with appropriate caveats)
4. Clear roadmap for validation

We believe transparency about limitations, combined with concrete validation 
plans, is more valuable than overstating underpowered findings.

**Changes Made:**
- Added Section X.X: "Limitations: Underpowered Venue Coverage"
- Added Table X: Power analysis by venue
- Added Figure X: Learning curves showing data size impact

## Key Messaging Points

### **What to Emphasize:**

1. **Transparency**: "We explicitly acknowledge that ICLR is underpowered and quantify the impact"

2. **Quantification**: "Power analysis shows ICLR has only 45% power; confidence intervals are 2.5× wider"

3. **Mitigation**: "Transfer learning and bootstrap methods partially address data scarcity"

4. **Concrete plans**: "We commit to collecting 800 ICLR papers within 6 months"

5. **Revised claims**: "We've revised all ICLR-specific claims to reflect uncertainty"

6. **Remaining value**: "NIPS findings are robust; methodology transfers to other venues"

### **What to Avoid:**

1. **Dismissing the concern**: Don't say "300 papers is enough"

2. **Vague promises**: Don't just say "we'll collect more data later"

3. **Overstating ICLR findings**: Don't make strong claims based on underpowered data

4. **Ignoring the problem**: Don't hide the limitation in a footnote

- Add caveats and confidence intervals throughout

**Day 7:**
- Write "Validation Strategy" section
- Commit to follow-up experiments
- Proofread and finalize

### **For Rebuttal (1-2 days available):**

**Priority 1 (Must do):**
- Run power analysis (1 hour)
- Calculate bootstrap CI (1 hour)
- Draft rebuttal response acknowledging limitation
- Revise abstract/intro to add caveats

**Priority 2 (If time permits):**
- Run learning curve analysis (2-3 hours)
- Run transfer learning experiment (4-6 hours)
- Add brief discussion of limitation

### **Post-Publication Follow-Up:**

**Month 1-2:**
- Collect ICLR 2018-2024 data from OpenReview
- Clean and annotate data
- Replicate experiments

**Month 3-4:**
- Analyze results
- Compare to 2017 findings
- Write technical report

**Month 5-6:**
- Release expanded dataset
- Submit workshop paper or arXiv preprint
- Update project website

## Key Takeaways

1. **Acknowledge explicitly**: Don't hide the underpowered limitation—quantify it with power analysis

2. **Provide immediate evidence**: Use existing NIPS data to simulate and quantify the impact

3. **Offer concrete solutions**: Transfer learning provides immediate improvement; data collection provides long-term validation

4. **Revise claims appropriately**: Distinguish between robust (NIPS) and preliminary (ICLR) findings

5. **Commit to follow-up**: Specific timeline and deliverables show seriousness

6. **Maintain value proposition**: Even with limitations, the work contributes methodology and robust NIPS findings

7. **Be transparent**: Commit to releasing follow-up results regardless of outcome

The goal is to turn a weakness into a strength by demonstrating scientific rigor, self-awareness, and commitment to validation.
