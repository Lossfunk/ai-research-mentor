Replicating PeerRead on newer conference cycles faces two intertwined limitations: data drift and evolving reviewer guidelines. First, the underlying distribution of submissions has shifted—topics (e.g., emergence of new subfields), writing conventions, page limits, and artifact-availability norms differ by year and venue—so models or heuristics calibrated on earlier cycles may face both covariate shift (paper content and structure) and label shift (score and decision distributions), undermining comparability across time. Second, review forms and policies have changed: rating scales and rubrics are periodically revised; structured fields (e.g., reproducibility checklists, ethics/broader-impact statements) appear or disappear; the role and format of author responses, public comments, and meta-reviews vary; and decision taxonomies (e.g., “borderline,” multi-stage decisions, track-specific thresholds) are redefined. These changes can reweight what reviewers emphasize (originality vs. reproducibility, societal impact, code/data release), alter calibration of scores, and introduce systematic differences in review length and structure, which in turn break feature extractors tuned to legacy templates and complicate label alignment. In addition, platform heterogeneity (OpenReview vs. other systems), differing degrees of public availability, and shifting acceptance rates introduce selection bias; multiple revisions and versioned reviews can create duplicate or longitudinal entries that are difficult to harmonize; and policy changes in anonymity and ethics screening may censor or reshape text. Collectively, these factors limit out-of-the-box transfer, threaten the validity of year-over-year comparisons, and mean that conclusions drawn from a “replicated” PeerRead on recent cycles should be interpreted as conditional on contemporaneous guidelines and distributions rather than as directly commensurate with earlier releases.
