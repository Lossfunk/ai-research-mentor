**Response to Reviewer X: Spurious Lexical Cues**

We thank the reviewer for this critical concern. We agree that models may 
exploit spurious correlations (e.g., specific author names, trendy keywords, 
venue-specific jargon) rather than genuine quality signals. To address this, 
we have conducted four new diagnostic analyses:

**1. Adversarial Lexical Perturbations** (New Analysis): We systematically 
replaced high-frequency accepted-paper keywords (e.g., "deep learning", 
"neural") with synonyms or generic terms. Model performance degrades only 
minimally (ΔF1 = -0.02), suggesting predictions rely on semantic content 
rather than keyword matching. In contrast, perturbing structural features 
(e.g., removing equations) causes substantial degradation (ΔF1 = -0.08), 
indicating reliance on meaningful signals.

**2. Cross-Venue Vocabulary Analysis** (New Analysis): We identified venue-
specific vocabulary (words appearing >2× more frequently in one venue) and 
trained models with these terms masked. Performance remains stable (F1 = 
0.XX vs. 0.YY baseline), demonstrating that models generalize beyond venue-
specific jargon.

**3. Temporal Vocabulary Shift** (New Analysis): We tested models on papers 
using vocabulary from different time periods. Despite 35% vocabulary turnover 
between 2013 and 2017 (reflecting shifts from "deep belief networks" to 
"transformers"), model performance degrades only 5%, indicating robustness 
to lexical drift.

**4. Feature Attribution Analysis** (New Analysis): SHAP analysis reveals 
that top predictive features include readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid), 
structural features (equation density, reference count), and semantic 
coherence—not specific keywords. The most predictive unigrams are generic 
quality indicators ("however", "therefore", "significant") rather than 
topic-specific terms.

These analyses provide strong evidence that our models learn review-worthy 
content patterns rather than spurious lexical shortcuts. Full details are 
in revised Section X.X.

### X.X Addressing Spurious Correlation Concerns

**The Concern.** A critical question for any text classification model is 
whether it learns meaningful patterns or exploits spurious correlations. For 
peer review prediction, potential spurious cues include:

- **Trendy keywords**: Papers mentioning "deep learning" or "transformers" 
  may be accepted due to topic popularity rather than quality
- **Author-identifying information**: Prestigious institutions or well-known 
  authors may leak into text
- **Venue-specific jargon**: Each venue has preferred terminology that may 
  not reflect quality
- **Temporal artifacts**: Acceptance criteria may change over time, creating 
  year-specific patterns
- **Length bias**: Longer papers may be accepted simply because they're more 
  thorough, not better

We address this concern through five complementary diagnostic analyses.

### Diagnostic 1: Adversarial Lexical Perturbations

**Method.** We systematically perturb papers to remove potential spurious 
cues while preserving semantic content:

1. **Keyword replacement**: Replace high-frequency accepted-paper keywords 
   with synonyms or generic terms
2. **Jargon neutralization**: Replace venue-specific terms with generic 
   equivalents
3. **Author de-identification**: Remove acknowledgments, self-citations, 
   institutional affiliations
4. **Temporal normalization**: Replace year-specific terms with timeless 
   equivalents

If models rely on spurious cues, performance should degrade substantially. 
If models learn semantic content, performance should remain stable.

**Results.** [Table X]

| Perturbation Type | Example | F1 (Original) | F1 (Perturbed) | ΔF1 | Interpretation |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|----------------|-----|----------------|
| None (baseline) | - | 0.XX | - | - | - |
| Keyword replacement | "deep learning" → "machine learning" | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.02 | **Robust** |
| Jargon neutralization | "convolutional" → "hierarchical" | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.01 | **Robust** |
| Author de-identification | Remove acknowledgments | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.03 | **Robust** |
| Temporal normalization | "LSTM" → "recurrent model" | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.02 | **Robust** |
| **Meaningful perturbations** (control) |
| Remove equations | Delete all equations | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.08 | **Sensitive** |
| Reduce references | Remove 50% of citations | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.06 | **Sensitive** |
| Simplify language | Reduce to 8th-grade reading level | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.05 | **Sensitive** |

**Interpretation.** Lexical perturbations (keyword replacement, jargon 
neutralization) cause minimal performance degradation (ΔF1 < 0.03), while 
meaningful content perturbations (removing equations, reducing references) 
cause substantial degradation (ΔF1 > 0.05). This demonstrates that models 
rely on semantic content and structural features rather than specific keywords.

**Statistical significance.** Differences between lexical and meaningful 
perturbations are statistically significant (p < 0.001, paired t-test across 
100 test papers).

### Diagnostic 2: Vocabulary-Masked Models

**Method.** We identify potentially spurious vocabulary and train models 
with these terms masked:

1. **Venue-specific terms**: Words appearing >2× more frequently in one venue
2. **Temporal terms**: Words with >50% frequency change between early/late years
3. **Trendy keywords**: Top 100 most frequent content words in accepted papers
4. **Author-identifying terms**: Institution names, author names, grant numbers

We train models with these vocabularies masked (replaced with [MASK] token) 
and compare to baseline.

**Results.** [Table Y]

| Masked Vocabulary | # Terms Masked | F1 (Baseline) | F1 (Masked) | ΔF1 | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| None | 0 | 0.XX | - | - | - |
| Venue-specific | 347 | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.02 | **Minimal impact** |
| Temporal terms | 189 | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.03 | **Minimal impact** |
| Trendy keywords | 100 | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.01 | **Minimal impact** |
| Author-identifying | 523 | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.02 | **Minimal impact** |
| **All spurious combined** | 1,159 | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.04 | **Still robust** |
| **All content words** (control) | 10,000 | 0.XX | 0.YY | -0.35 | **Severe impact** |

**Interpretation.** Masking potentially spurious vocabulary (1,159 terms) 
reduces performance by only ΔF1 = 0.04, while masking all content words 
reduces performance by ΔF1 = 0.35. This 9× difference demonstrates that 
models rely primarily on semantic content rather than specific spurious terms.

**Qualitative analysis.** Manual inspection of venue-specific terms reveals 
they are often legitimate technical terms (e.g., "convolutional" for NIPS, 
"attention" for ICLR) rather than spurious jargon, explaining why masking 
has minimal impact.

### Diagnostic 3: Cross-Temporal Vocabulary Robustness

**Method.** We test whether models trained on one time period's vocabulary 
generalize to papers using different vocabulary:

1. **Identify vocabulary shift**: Compare 2013-2014 vs. 2016-2017 vocabulary
2. **Quantify turnover**: Measure % of vocabulary that changes
3. **Test transfer**: Train on early years, test on late years with vocabulary 
   mapping

**Results.** [Table Z]

| Metric | 2013-2014 | 2016-2017 | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Unique terms | 8,347 | 9,123 | +9% |
| Overlap | - | - | 65% |
| New terms (2016-2017 only) | - | 3,193 | 35% |
| Deprecated terms (2013-2014 only) | - | 2,417 | 29% |

**Top emerging terms (2016-2017):**
- "attention mechanism" (0 → 147 occurrences)
- "residual connection" (0 → 89 occurrences)
- "batch normalization" (3 → 134 occurrences)
- "adversarial training" (1 → 98 occurrences)

**Top deprecated terms (2013-2014):**
- "deep belief network" (87 → 2 occurrences)
- "restricted Boltzmann" (56 → 1 occurrence)
- "sparse coding" (43 → 8 occurrences)

**Transfer performance:**

| Training Period | Test Period | F1 | ΔF1 from In-Period |
|-----------------|-------------|----|--------------------|
| 2013-2014 | 2013-2014 | 0.XX | - |
| 2013-2014 | 2016-2017 | 0.YY | -0.05 |
| 2016-2017 | 2016-2017 | 0.XX | - |
| 2016-2017 | 2013-2014 | 0.YY | -0.04 |

**Interpretation.** Despite 35% vocabulary turnover, cross-temporal transfer 
degrades performance by only ΔF1 = 0.05. If models relied on specific keywords 
(e.g., "deep belief network" for acceptance), performance would degrade 
substantially when these terms disappear. The minimal degradation demonstrates 
robustness to lexical drift.

### Diagnostic 4: Feature Attribution Analysis

**Method.** We use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify which 
features drive predictions and categorize them as:
- **Spurious**: Specific keywords, author names, venue jargon
- **Meaningful**: Readability, structure, semantic coherence, argumentation

**Results.** [Table W]

**Top 20 Features by SHAP Importance:**

| Rank | Feature | Type | SHAP Value | Interpretation |
|------|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Flesch-Kincaid score | Meaningful | 0.XX | Readability |
| 2 | Reference count | Meaningful | 0.XX | Thoroughness |
| 3 | Equation density | Meaningful | 0.XX | Technical rigor |
| 4 | Discourse markers ("however", "therefore") | Meaningful | 0.XX | Argumentation |
| 5 | Section count | Meaningful | 0.XX | Organization |
| 6 | Average sentence length | Meaningful | 0.XX | Complexity |
| 7 | Introduction length | Meaningful | 0.XX | Motivation clarity |
| 8 | Semantic coherence (LSA) | Meaningful | 0.XX | Logical flow |
| 9 | Hedge word ratio | Meaningful | 0.XX | Confidence |
| 10 | Citation to recent work | Meaningful | 0.XX | Currency |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 18 | "deep learning" (unigram) | Potentially spurious | 0.YY | Topic keyword |
| 19 | "neural network" (unigram) | Potentially spurious | 0.YY | Topic keyword |
| 20 | "state-of-the-art" (bigram) | Potentially spurious | 0.YY | Claim phrase |

**Feature type distribution:**
- Meaningful features: 85% of total SHAP importance
- Potentially spurious features: 15% of total SHAP importance

**Interpretation.** The vast majority (85%) of model predictions are driven 
by meaningful features (readability, structure, coherence) rather than 
specific keywords. Even the top-ranked unigrams ("however", "therefore") 
are generic discourse markers indicating argumentation quality, not topic-
specific terms.

**Qualitative examples.** For individual predictions, SHAP reveals:
- **Accepted paper**: High importance for equation density (+0.12), reference 
  count (+0.09), coherence (+0.08); minimal importance for topic keywords
- **Rejected paper**: High importance for low readability (-0.15), short 
  introduction (-0.11), few references (-0.09); minimal importance for 
  topic keywords

### Diagnostic 5: Counterfactual Analysis

**Method.** We generate counterfactual examples by minimally modifying papers 
to flip predictions, then analyze what changes are required:

1. **Spurious hypothesis**: If models rely on keywords, changing a few words 
   should flip predictions
2. **Meaningful hypothesis**: If models rely on content, substantial changes 
   to structure/quality should be required

**Results.** [Table V]

| Modification Type | Avg # Changes to Flip Prediction | Success Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Spurious modifications** |
| Change 5 keywords | 5 words | 8% | **Ineffective** |
| Change 10 keywords | 10 words | 15% | **Ineffective** |
| Change 20 keywords | 20 words | 23% | **Ineffective** |
| **Meaningful modifications** |
| Add 10 references | 10 citations | 67% | **Effective** |
| Add 5 equations | 5 equations | 58% | **Effective** |
| Improve readability (1 grade level) | ~50 words | 71% | **Effective** |
| Restructure (add sections) | ~100 words | 63% | **Effective** |

**Interpretation.** Changing keywords (even 20 keywords) flips predictions 
only 23% of the time, while meaningful modifications (adding references, 
equations, improving readability) flip predictions 58-71% of the time. This 
demonstrates that models are sensitive to content quality, not lexical cues.

**Qualitative example:**
- **Original (predicted reject)**: Short paper (6 pages), few references (12), 
  low readability (FK = 14.2)
- **Keyword changes only**: Replace "neural network" with "deep learning" 
  throughout → Still predicted reject
- **Meaningful changes**: Add 8 references, improve readability to FK = 12.5 
  → Predicted accept

### Summary: Evidence Against Spurious Correlations

Our five diagnostic analyses provide converging evidence that models learn 
meaningful quality signals:

1. **Robustness to lexical perturbations**: Keyword replacement has minimal 
   impact (ΔF1 < 0.03)
2. **Robustness to vocabulary masking**: Masking 1,159 potentially spurious 
   terms reduces F1 by only 0.04
3. **Robustness to temporal vocabulary shift**: 35% vocabulary turnover 
   reduces F1 by only 0.05
4. **Feature attribution**: 85% of predictions driven by meaningful features 
   (readability, structure, coherence)
5. **Counterfactual analysis**: Meaningful modifications (references, 
   equations) flip predictions; keyword changes do not

**Remaining concerns.** While our analyses demonstrate that models primarily 
learn meaningful signals, we acknowledge that:
- 15% of feature importance comes from potentially spurious features
- Some topic-specific keywords (e.g., "deep learning") have non-zero importance
- Models may still exploit subtle biases we haven't detected

**Mitigation strategies.** To further reduce spurious correlations, we 
recommend:
- Training with adversarial data augmentation (keyword perturbations)
- Regularizing against venue-specific vocabulary
- Using causal inference techniques to identify and remove confounders
- Incorporating domain-invariant features (readability, structure)

These remain important directions for future work.

    return venue_specific

# Train model with masked vocabulary
venue_specific = get_venue_specific_vocab(nips_papers, iclr_papers)

def mask_vocabulary(paper, vocab_to_mask):
    """Replace specified vocabulary with [MASK] token"""

print(f"New terms: {len(new_terms)} ({len(new_terms)/len(late_vocab):.1%})")
print(f"Deprecated terms: {len(deprecated_terms)}")

# Test cross-temporal transfer

## Rebuttal Response Templates

### **Template A: Strong Evidence (If Diagnostics Show Robustness)**

```markdown
We thank the reviewer for this critical concern. To address it, we conducted 
four diagnostic analyses:

**1. Adversarial Keyword Perturbation**: Replacing high-frequency keywords 
(e.g., "deep learning" → "machine learning") in 200 test papers causes 
minimal performance degradation (ΔF1 = -0.02), with 94% of predictions 
remaining stable. In contrast, removing meaningful content (equations, 
references) causes substantial degradation (ΔF1 = -0.08). This demonstrates 
robustness to lexical cues.

**2. SHAP Feature Attribution**: Analysis of 500 predictions reveals that 
85% of model importance comes from meaningful features (readability: 32%, 
structural features: 28%, coherence: 25%) rather than specific keywords 
(15%). The most important unigrams are generic discourse markers ("however", 
"therefore") rather than topic-specific terms.

**3. Temporal Vocabulary Robustness**: Despite 35% vocabulary turnover 
between 2013 and 2017 (e.g., "deep belief networks" → "transformers"), 
cross-temporal performance degrades only 5%. If models relied on specific 
keywords, this degradation would be much larger.

**4. Vocabulary Masking**: Training with 347 venue-specific terms masked 
reduces performance by only ΔF1 = 0.02, demonstrating that models generalize 
beyond venue jargon.

These analyses provide strong evidence that our models learn review-worthy 
content (structure, clarity, rigor) rather than spurious lexical shortcuts. 
We have added Section X.X with full details and revised our claims to 
emphasize interpretable features.
```

### **Template B: Mixed Evidence (If Some Spurious Signals Detected)**

```markdown
We thank the reviewer for this important concern. Our diagnostic analyses 
reveal a nuanced picture:

**Evidence against spurious correlations:**
- Keyword perturbation causes minimal degradation (ΔF1 = -0.02)
- 75% of feature importance comes from meaningful features (readability, 
  structure, coherence)
- Cross-temporal transfer is robust (ΔF1 = -0.05 despite 35% vocabulary shift)

**Evidence of some spurious signals:**
- 25% of feature importance comes from potentially spurious features (topic 
  keywords, venue-specific terms)
- Some high-importance unigrams are topic-specific ("neural", "convolutional")
- Venue-specific vocabulary masking reduces performance by ΔF1 = 0.06

**Interpretation**: Our models primarily learn meaningful signals but do 
exploit some spurious correlations. This is consistent with findings from 
other text classification tasks and reflects genuine correlations in the 
data (e.g., papers on popular topics may receive more careful review).

**Mitigation**: We have:
1. Added adversarial data augmentation (keyword perturbation) to training
2. Regularized against venue-specific vocabulary
3. Reported feature importance to enable interpretability
4. Revised claims to acknowledge this limitation

Performance with mitigation: F1 = X.XX (vs. Y.YY baseline), demonstrating 
that meaningful signals alone provide competitive performance.

We have added Section X.X with full diagnostic results and discussion.

### **Template C: Weak Evidence (If Diagnostics Are Inconclusive)**

```markdown
We thank the reviewer for this critical concern. We have conducted preliminary 
diagnostic analyses:

**SHAP Feature Attribution**: The top 20 features include both meaningful 
signals (readability: rank 1, reference count: rank 2, equation density: 
rank 3) and potentially spurious signals (topic keywords: ranks 15-20). 
Quantitatively, ~70% of feature importance comes from meaningful features.

**Keyword Perturbation**: Replacing high-frequency keywords causes modest 
performance degradation (ΔF1 = -0.05), suggesting some reliance on lexical 
cues but not complete dependence.

**Interpretation**: Our models likely learn a mixture of meaningful and 
spurious signals. Disentangling these requires more sophisticated causal 
analysis, which we propose as future work:

1. **Causal intervention analysis**: Use propensity score matching to 
   estimate causal effect of keywords vs. content quality
2. **Adversarial training**: Train models with keyword perturbations to 
   reduce spurious correlations
3. **Interpretability-focused models**: Develop models that explicitly 
   separate content features from lexical features

We acknowledge this limitation in revised Section X.X and have toned down 
claims about what our models "learn" vs. what they "predict."

**Remaining contribution**: Even if models exploit some spurious correlations, 
our work provides:
- Benchmark for future debiasing efforts
- Feature analysis identifying potential spurious signals
- Evaluation methodology applicable to more robust models

## Key Messaging Points

### **What to Emphasize:**

1. **Proactive analysis**: "We conducted four diagnostic analyses to address this concern"

2. **Quantitative evidence**: "85% of feature importance comes from meaningful features"

3. **Robustness tests**: "Keyword perturbation causes minimal degradation (ΔF1 = -0.02)"

4. **Transparency**: "We acknowledge that 15% of importance comes from potentially spurious features"

5. **Mitigation**: "We added adversarial training to reduce spurious correlations"

### **What to Avoid:**

1. **Dismissing the concern**: Don't say "spurious correlations don't matter"

2. **Unfounded claims**: Don't claim models learn "true quality" without evidence

3. **Cherry-picking**: Don't report only favorable diagnostics

4. **Vague responses**: Don't just say "we'll investigate this" without concrete results

## Key Takeaways

1. **Take the concern seriously**: Spurious correlations are a legitimate threat to validity

2. **Provide quantitative evidence**: SHAP and perturbation experiments are essential

3. **Be transparent**: Report both favorable and unfavorable findings

4. **Show robustness**: Multiple complementary diagnostics are more convincing than one

5. **Acknowledge limitations**: If some spurious signals exist, admit it and propose mitigation

6. **Emphasize interpretability**: Feature analysis provides value even if some features are spurious

7. **Propose future work**: Causal analysis and adversarial training are natural next steps

The goal is to demonstrate that you've rigorously investigated the concern and that your models primarily (even if not exclusively) learn meaningful signals.
