The search reveals that **graph neural networks for sea-ice forecasting is not entirely novel**—there is recent and emerging work in this area. Here's what exists:

## Existing Work

1. **Arctic Sea Ice Prediction Based on Multi-Scale Graph Modeling** ([AGU Journal of Geophysical Research, 2024](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2024JD042136))  
   This paper explicitly applies graph modeling to Arctic sea ice prediction, indicating that the core idea has been explored.

2. **Deep Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Sub-Seasonal Sea Ice** ([UWaterloo repository, 2025](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/337fe662-1de0-42b0-825a-8ac522d9ed66))  
   A very recent thesis/paper focusing on sub-seasonal sea ice forecasting using deep GNNs, showing active research in this exact intersection.

3. **Regional Ocean Forecasting with Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks** ([arXiv, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.11807v2))  
   While focused on ocean forecasting more broadly, this demonstrates GNN application to related spatiotemporal oceanographic problems.

## Opportunities for Novelty

Despite existing work, there are several angles where you could contribute:

- **Temporal scale**: Focus on a different forecasting horizon (e.g., daily vs. seasonal vs. decadal)
- **Spatial resolution or region**: Target specific regions (e.g., Antarctic vs. Arctic, coastal vs. basin-scale) or finer-grained predictions
- **Graph construction**: Novel ways to define nodes/edges (e.g., physics-informed graphs, adaptive topology, multi-modal data integration)
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combine GNNs with physics-based models, data assimilation, or other ML architectures
- **Specific phenomena**: Target particular sea-ice processes (e.g., ice thickness, drift, melt ponds, leads) rather than just extent/concentration
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Probabilistic forecasting or ensemble methods with GNNs
- **Data efficiency**: Few-shot learning, transfer learning, or methods that work with sparse observations

## Next Steps

1. **Read the 2024 AGU and UWaterloo papers** to understand what has been done and identify gaps
2. **Define your specific contribution**: What aspect of sea-ice forecasting, what temporal/spatial scale, and what methodological innovation?
3. **Consider the data**: What observations are available (satellite, buoys, models) and how would you construct the graph?

**Bottom line**: The general idea exists, but there's room for meaningful contributions depending on your specific approach, scale, and application focus.
