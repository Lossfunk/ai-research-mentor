Short answer: Yes, it’s feasible—if you scope tightly and follow a staged plan. You can build a minimal, publishable prototype by (1) starting with a simple non-graph baseline, (2) adding a basic graph layer on top of the same inputs, and (3) running clear ablations. Expect 6–10 weeks part‑time if you lean on existing libraries and notebooks.

A pragmatic plan for a first project (no prior coding)
- Week 0–1: Setup and warm‑ups
  - Learn just enough Python and PyTorch to run tutorials (PyTorch Geometric, “create a GNN” tutorial).
  - Use Colab or a single T4/A10 GPU; don’t buy hardware.
- Week 2–3: Data and baseline
  - Data: OSI‑SAF sea‑ice concentration (SIC) daily fields; work on a fixed 2–3 year slice and a 256×256 Arctic crop to start.
  - Baseline: Train a small UNet/ConvLSTM to forecast SIC 1–7 days ahead. This gives you a reference to beat and teaches the pipeline (data → model → metrics).
- Week 4–6: First graph model
  - Build a grid graph over your crop (each pixel/node connected to 8–12 neighbors via k‑NN or 4-neighborhood). Use PyTorch Geometric.
  - GNN: 2–3 layers of GraphConv/GraphSAGE over node features (recent SIC frames), followed by a small MLP to predict next‑day SIC. Roll out for multi‑day forecasts.
  - Evaluate against the baseline on the same splits and metrics.
- Week 7–8: One substantive improvement
  - Swap static edges for motion‑aware edges using daily ice‑drift vectors (from NSIDC) to create directed adjacency, or add a physics‑informed loss. This is often where GNNs can shine.

Minimal compute and tooling
- Compute: 1 GPU with 12–24 GB VRAM is plenty for 256×256 crops and small models; training runs in minutes to hours.
- Libraries: xarray/netCDF4 (data), PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, scikit‑learn (metrics), matplotlib for quick plots.
- Data handling: Stick to the native polar stereographic grid from OSI‑SAF to avoid geospatial headaches at first.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
- E1: Baseline UNet vs basic GNN
  - Setup: Same input window (e.g., past 7 days of SIC), predict 1, 3, 7 days ahead.
  - Metrics: RMSE (SIC %), anomaly correlation (ACC), sea‑ice extent F1 (threshold SIC>15%).
  - Falsifiable claim: If the GNN does not reduce 7‑day RMSE or improve ACC over UNet, conclude plain graph structure offers no advantage on this setup; otherwise report the gain and where it occurs (e.g., marginal ice zone).
- E2: Static vs motion‑aware graphs
  - Setup: Same GNN backbone; compare (a) static spatial k‑NN edges vs (b) directed edges derived from daily ice‑drift vectors (connect each node to where ice is advected).
  - Metrics: As in E1; add boundary Dice score for 15–80% SIC band.
  - Falsifiable claim: Motion‑aware adjacency improves 3–7 day ACC and boundary Dice at p<0.05 (paired test). If not, motion‑aware edges didn’t help.
- E3: Physics‑informed loss vs pure MSE
  - Setup: Add an advection‑consistency regularizer: ∂C/∂t + u·∇C ≈ 0 using observed drift u; compare to MSE‑only training.
  - Metrics: RMSE at 1/3/7 days; temporal consistency term measured on predictions; stability on 7‑day rollouts.
  - Falsifiable claim: Physics‑regularized model reduces the consistency error and 7‑day RMSE without hurting 1‑day RMSE; if not, the regularizer is unnecessary in this regime.

What makes this feasible for a beginner
- You can reuse ready‑made pieces: public SIC datasets, PyTorch Geometric layers, simple training loops.
- You only need to implement data loading, a few model classes, and evaluation—no custom CUDA or fancy tooling.
- Clear ablations (E1–E3) let you make a credible claim even if absolute accuracy isn’t state‑of‑the‑art.

Common pitfalls (and how to avoid them)
- Data leakage: Split by time (train/val/test chronologically), never shuffle across time.
- Too‑big domains: Start with a 256×256 tile; scale up only after you have stable results.
- Metric myopia: Report both pixel RMSE and decision‑relevant metrics (e.g., extent F1 for SIC>15%).
- Unstable rollouts: Train with multi‑step losses or scheduled sampling once single‑step is stable.

Stretch goals (optional)
- Probabilistic forecasts (ensembles or MC‑dropout) and reliability diagrams.
- Cross‑region generalization (train Arctic, test Antarctic) as a rough transfer check.

Two helpful anchors to consult
- Arctic Sea Ice Prediction Based on Multi‑Scale Graph Modeling With … (JGR Atmospheres, 2024) — shows a graph approach to SIC prediction, useful for scoping what’s been done and reasonable gains.
- Seasonal Arctic sea ice forecasting with probabilistic deep learning (Nat. Commun., 2021) — strong non‑graph baseline and evaluation practice for longer horizons.

If you’d like, I can sketch the exact code skeleton (dataset class, model, training loop) tailored to OSI‑SAF SIC to get you moving in a day.
