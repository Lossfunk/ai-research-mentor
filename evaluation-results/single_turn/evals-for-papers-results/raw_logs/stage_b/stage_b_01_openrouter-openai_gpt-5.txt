Short answer: Partially. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have already been explored for sea‑ice prediction, including a recent multi‑scale graph modeling approach for Arctic sea‑ice prediction, so the idea is not entirely novel. However, there is room for clear novelty in how you construct the graph (e.g., dynamic, motion‑aware graphs), the physical constraints you impose, the targets (e.g., coupled concentration–thickness–drift), and the forecasting regime (e.g., probabilistic seasonal forecasts) [1]. Related work in ocean forecasting has also shown benefits of hierarchical/graph formulations, underscoring feasibility and informing design choices [2]. Deep learning baselines (non‑graph) already set strong performance in seasonal Arctic sea‑ice forecasting, which you should beat or complement to establish contribution [3].

What can still be novel
- Dynamic, physics‑aware graphs: Build edges from observed ice motion fields (NSIDC drift) or modeled flow, rather than static k‑NN or grid‑based graphs; update adjacencies over time to reflect advection/shear [2].  
- Multi‑task and coupled targets: Jointly forecast concentration, thickness, and drift with shared graph encoders and cross‑task constraints (e.g., mass/area conservation linking thickness and concentration) [3].  
- Probabilistic, long‑lead forecasts: Calibrated uncertainty (ensembles or variational methods) for weekly-to-seasonal horizons within a GNN, compared to strong probabilistic CNN/Transformer baselines [3].  
- Multi‑scale/hierarchical pooling: Explicit marginal‑ice‑zone (MIZ) treatment via multi‑resolution graph pools; quantify where the gains appear (edges vs interior) [1,2].  
- Hybrid graph–numerics: Use graph nets as learned correctors for a physics model (e.g., SIC advection–diffusion), or assimilate OSI‑SAF observations into a GNN state [2,4].  
- Operational efficiency: Demonstrate latency/compute advantages over high‑res gridded models for pan‑Arctic inference, supporting deployment [2].

Concrete, falsifiable experiments
- E1: Static vs dynamic graphs  
  Setup: Same GNN backbone; compare (a) static geographic k‑NN graph on polar stereographic grid vs (b) dynamic graph whose edges derive from daily ice‑motion vectors (NSIDC) with thresholded flow connectivity.  
  Data/targets: OSI‑SAF SIC daily analysis as target; leads: 1, 3, 7, 14 days [4].  
  Metrics: RMSE (SIC %), anomaly correlation (ACC), and MIZ Dice (15–80% SIC band).  
  Falsifiable outcome: Dynamic graph yields significantly lower RMSE and higher ACC at 7–14 days (paired t‑test, p<0.05). If not, claim that motion‑aware adjacency is unnecessary is supported.

- E2: Multi‑scale graph pooling ablation  
  Setup: Single‑scale GNN vs hierarchical GNN with coarsen→refine pooling; identical parameter counts.  
  Data/targets: Same as E1.  
  Metrics: Global RMSE vs MIZ RMSE; energy spectrum of forecast error across spatial scales.  
  Falsifiable outcome: Hierarchical model reduces MIZ RMSE by ≥5% and shifts error power to larger scales, consistent with prior ocean graph work [2]; otherwise, multi‑scale pooling is not beneficial for SIC.

- E3: Physics‑informed loss vs pure MSE  
  Setup: Add continuity/advection consistency term: ∂C/∂t + u·∇C ≈ 0 using observed ice motion u; compare to MSE‑only training.  
  Data/targets: OSI‑SAF SIC; NSIDC drift for u; 1–14 day leads [4].  
  Metrics: RMSE, temporal consistency (∥Ĉt+1 − Ĉt − u·∇Ĉt∥2), stability under rollout to 14 days.  
  Falsifiable outcome: Physics‑regularized model lowers temporal inconsistency and reduces 14‑day blow‑up without sacrificing 1‑day RMSE.

- E4: Probabilistic seasonal forecasting with GNN vs state‑of‑the‑art DL baseline  
  Setup: GNN with ensemble/MC‑dropout for 1–4 month forecasts initialized monthly; compare to a published probabilistic DL baseline [3].  
  Metrics: Brier score and reliability diagrams for regional ice presence (SIC>15%), sea‑ice extent anomaly correlation.  
  Falsifiable outcome: GNN matches or exceeds baseline Brier score at 2–3 months; if worse, conclude that graph structure does not help at seasonal horizons.

- E5: Cross‑hemisphere generalization  
  Setup: Train on Arctic, evaluate zero‑shot on Antarctic (with minimal tuning).  
  Metrics: RMSE degradation ratio (Antarctic vs Arctic), regional breakdown (Weddell, Ross).  
  Falsifiable outcome: Degradation <20% indicates learned transferable structure; otherwise, strong regional specialization is required.

Data and baselines to use
- SIC: OSI‑SAF reprocessed climate data record (consistent, long‑term SIC for training/validation) [4].  
- Optional: Copernicus L4 global sea‑ice concentration time series for operational comparisons [5].  
- Baselines: ConvLSTM/UNet, Swin/ViT, and the Nature Communications probabilistic DL model for seasonal timescales [3].

Bottom line
- Using graph nets for sea‑ice forecasting is not entirely novel in 2024–2025, but there is clear room for a novel, publishable contribution via motion‑aware dynamic graphs, physics‑regularized objectives, coupled targets, hierarchical pooling, and robust probabilistic evaluation against strong baselines [1–3]. Anchoring your contribution with rigorous ablations (E1–E3) and seasonal comparisons (E4) will make the novelty and value unambiguous.
