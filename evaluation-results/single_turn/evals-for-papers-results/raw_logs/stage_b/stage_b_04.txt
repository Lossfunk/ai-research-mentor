Short answer: yes, it’s feasible—but scope it tightly and treat the first 2 weeks as a “reproduce-then-extend” sprint with a tiny graph model on a small sea-ice patch in Colab. Deep learning has worked well for sea-ice forecasting (e.g., IceNet) and GNNs are a reasonable fit for grid/neighbor interactions in geophysics, so the idea is sound if you keep it small and structured at first [1], [2]. For uncertainty and reliability, there’s emerging GNN work you can borrow once you have a baseline [P1].

Stage: A – Pre idea → nudge toward Phase 0 pilot

Quick intake so I can tailor the plan
- Compute/time: Do you have a GPU (local/Colab/k8s) and how many hours/week can you commit?
- Background: Any Python or data wrangling experience, even in Excel/Matlab/R?
- Mentorship/collab: Do you have a lab/course/partner, or are you solo?
- Milestones: Are you aiming for a class project, internship portfolio, or a workshop submission (timeline)?
- Bottleneck: What feels scariest—coding basics, data access, or modeling choices?

Feasible Phase 0 (≤14 days), even with zero prior coding
- Goal: One tiny spatiotemporal GNN forecasting next-day sea-ice concentration (SIC) on a small region (e.g., Hudson Bay) trained in Google Colab.
- Dataset: Public SIC (e.g., OSI-SAF/NSIDC) plus optional ERA5 reanalysis features (air temp, wind). Use a 32×32 patch for 1–2 years to keep it light.
- Stack: Python + PyTorch + PyTorch Geometric (or DGL) + xarray/netCDF4. Start from a tutorial notebook; use CPU or free Colab GPU.
- Deliverables (gates to exit Phase 0): (1) prediction log with ≥14 entries and 1 reproduced figure/metric; (2) one experiment card + an ablation or negative result documented.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments (you can run these in ~2 weeks total)
1) Minimal GNN beats persistence on next-day SIC in a small patch
- Hypothesis: A 2-layer GCN using 7-day lagged SIC features on a fixed 4-nearest-neighbor grid graph will reduce MAE by ≥5% vs persistence for 1-day lead. Falsifier: MAE reduction <2%.
- Setup: Build a grid graph over your 32×32 patch; node features = past 7 days SIC; target = next-day SIC. Train/val/test split by time.
- Metrics: MAE/RMSE per pixel; ice-edge error (distance or F1 on edge mask); simple reliability via MC dropout (optional).
- Interpretation: If GCN ≈ persistence, try longer lags or slightly deeper GCN; if it wins near the ice edge, you’re capturing spatial coupling.
- Follow-ups: Compare to 2D CNN on the same patch to probe whether graph vs convolution helps with irregular coastlines [2].

2) Edge topology ablation: local grid vs physical adjacency
- Hypothesis: Using coastline-aware adjacency (masking land nodes; 8-neighbor over ocean only) improves edge-region accuracy by ≥10% vs vanilla 4-NN grid at 1–3 day leads. Falsifier: <3% improvement.
- Setup: Train identical GCNs with two graphs: (A) simple k-NN on all grid cells; (B) ocean-only adjacency. Keep data/seed fixed.
- Metrics: Ice-edge distance error; coastal MAE; compute and memory footprint.
- Interpretation: Gains suggest the relational inductive bias matters (graph structure encodes the right neighbors); no gains suggest features/temporal context limit performance [2].
- Follow-ups: Try dynamic k-NN using geostrophic currents or winds as edge weights to test physics-informed edges.

3) Feature ablation for lead times: SIC-only vs SIC+ERA5
- Hypothesis: Adding ERA5 2m temperature, winds, and SST reduces MAE by ≥5% for 3-day leads (smaller/no gain at 1 day). Falsifier: No improvement beyond ±2%.
- Setup: Same graph and model depth; two inputs: (A) SIC-only; (B) SIC + ERA5 channels; train both to 3-day lead.
- Metrics: MAE/RMSE; calibration (Brier or reliability diagram via MC dropout). Uncertainty calibration is known to be important in spatiotemporal GNNs [P1].
- Interpretation: If extra features help longer leads, data scarcity (not model class) is the bottleneck; if not, revisit normalization/temporal windows.
- Follow-ups: Simple uncertainty calibration (temperature scaling or bin-wise recalibration) to improve reliability [P1].

Recommendations and branches
- If no GPU: keep the patch small (≤1k nodes), few epochs, batch size 1–2 sequences; it will still train in Colab.
- If very new to coding: start with a runnable IceNet-style tutorial notebook (even if not GNN) to learn data plumbing, then swap the model for a tiny GCN next week [1]. This lowers the “data wrangling” barrier first.
- Tracking: Use our scoreboard—Reproduction fidelity (≤10% gap on MAE vs your own validation runs), Ablation clarity (does topology explain ≥50% of the gain?), and Writing cadence (one 1-page lab note/week).

Next actions (1–3 days)
- Pick a 32×32 region and download 1 year of SIC; load with xarray and visualize one month.
- Spin up Colab; run a PyTorch Geometric tutorial GCN on synthetic data; then switch to your SIC tensors.
- Draft one experiment card (hypothesis, falsifier, minimal test, variables, analysis plan, stop rule) for Experiment 1.

Intuition
- Sea ice evolves with strong local interactions and transport; a graph over neighboring grid cells encodes these relations naturally. Start tiny so you can learn the data and toolchain while still testing a real hypothesis.

Why this is principled
- GNNs provide relational inductive biases that help when interactions among neighboring entities drive dynamics [2]. Deep learning has already shown strong skill in sea-ice forecasting (IceNet), so a small, well-controlled GNN pilot is a reasonable extension [1]. Adding basic uncertainty checks is aligned with recent emphasis on calibration in spatiotemporal GNNs [P1].

Your turn: can you share your weekly time budget, access to Colab/GPU, and whether you prefer starting from an existing notebook (non-GNN) or jumping straight to a tiny GCN? Based on that, I’ll tailor the exact notebook and data slice.
