[Turn 0] SYSTEM:
You're a first-year PhD student working on a computer vision project. You're struggling with experimental design and want guidance on how to properly ablate your contributions and report results.

[Turn 1] USER:
When people say “ablate the attention module,” do they literally mean removing it entirely or just swapping in a vanilla replacement?

[Turn 1] ASSISTANT:
The phrase "ablate the attention module" can mean **either**, depending on the context and what the researcher is trying to test. Here's how it's typically used:

## 1. **Complete removal (zero-out or skip)**
   - The attention mechanism is entirely removed or bypassed.
   - For example, in a Transformer, you might skip the self-attention sublayer and pass the input directly to the feedforward network.
   - This tests whether attention is *necessary at all* for the task.

## 2. **Replacement with a simpler baseline**
   - The attention module is swapped with a "vanilla" or trivial alternative:
     - **Uniform attention**: all positions get equal weight (1/N).
     - **Identity mapping**: just pass through the input unchanged.
     - **Random attention**: weights are random rather than learned.
     - **Fixed positional attention**: attend only to a fixed window or pattern.
   - This tests whether the *learned, data-dependent* aspect of attention is what matters, or if a simpler mechanism suffices.

## 3. **Partial ablation**
   - Remove specific components *within* the attention module (e.g., remove the value projection, or ablate multi-head structure down to single-head).
   - This isolates which sub-components contribute to performance.

---

## What to look for in papers
When you read "we ablate the attention module," check the methods or ablation study section:
- **"Removed"** or **"disabled"** usually means complete removal.
- **"Replaced with uniform/random attention"** means a baseline swap.
- **"Ablated heads"** or **"ablated layers"** often means partial removal.

If the paper doesn't specify, it's worth checking the code or supplementary material—or noting the ambiguity if you're reviewing or replicating the work.

---

**In short:** "Ablation" is flexible. It can mean total removal, replacement with a trivial baseline, or partial disabling. The goal is always to isolate the contribution of that component by seeing what happens when it's gone or neutered.

[Turn 2] USER:
So if I swap in a fixed uniform baseline, do I still need to retrain the rest of the model or just evaluate the checkpoint?

[Turn 2] ASSISTANT:
**You typically just evaluate the checkpoint directly**—no retraining needed. Here's why and when you might do otherwise:

---

## Default: Evaluate without retraining
- **Why it works:** The rest of the model (feedforward layers, layer norms, output heads, etc.) has already learned to work with the *outputs* of the original attention module. 
- **What you're testing:** Whether the learned, data-dependent attention weights are critical, or if a dumb uniform baseline suffices given the representations the model has already built.
- **Common practice:** Most ablation studies in papers (e.g., analyzing Transformers) swap in the uniform attention and immediately evaluate on a validation/test set to measure the performance drop.

---

## When you *might* retrain
1. **Testing architectural necessity (not just learned weights)**
   - If you want to know "could a model with uniform attention learn this task from scratch?", you'd train a new model with uniform attention baked in.
   - This answers a different question: *architectural* contribution vs. *learned parameter* contribution.

2. **Compensatory adaptation**
   - Sometimes other parts of the model can partially compensate for a crippled attention module if given the chance to retrain.
   - Comparing "ablate-then-evaluate" vs. "ablate-then-retrain" can reveal whether attention is *necessary* or just *helpful given the current training regime*.

3. **Fine-tuning after ablation**
   - Occasionally researchers will fine-tune the rest of the model briefly after swapping in the baseline, to see if performance recovers. This tests robustness and redundancy.

---

## Practical recommendation
- **Start with no retraining:** Swap in uniform attention, evaluate your checkpoint, and report the performance drop. This is the standard ablation.
- **Optionally add a retrain experiment:** If you want to make a stronger claim (e.g., "attention is architecturally essential, not just a learned optimization"), train a model from scratch with uniform attention and compare.

---

**In short:** For a typical ablation study, just evaluate the checkpoint as-is. Retraining is a separate, more involved experiment that answers a different (though related) question about architectural necessity vs. learned importance.

[Turn 3] USER:
If I compare against a published baseline, should I retrain it myself or just cite their numbers?

[Turn 3] ASSISTANT:
**It depends on how closely your experimental setup matches theirs.** Here's a decision framework:

---

## **Cite their numbers if:**
1. **Your setup is identical or very close**
   - Same dataset, splits, preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and hardware constraints.
   - You're using their released checkpoint or following their exact protocol.
   - **Advantage:** Saves compute, and their numbers are peer-reviewed/reproducible.

2. **The baseline is well-established and stable**
   - Standard benchmarks (e.g., BERT on GLUE, ResNet on ImageNet) where results are widely replicated.
   - **Advantage:** Community trust; everyone knows the baseline performance.

3. **You lack resources to retrain**
   - Large models (e.g., GPT-scale) where retraining is prohibitively expensive.
   - **Acceptable practice:** Cite their numbers but explicitly note you didn't retrain, and discuss any setup differences.

---

## **Retrain yourself if:**
1. **Your setup differs in any meaningful way**
   - Different data splits, preprocessing, hyperparameters, random seeds, or hardware.
   - Different training duration, batch size, or optimizer settings.
   - **Why:** Even small changes can shift baselines by several points. Citing their numbers would be an unfair comparison.

2. **Reproducibility concerns**
   - The original paper lacks code, checkpoints, or key details.
   - You've seen variance in reported numbers across papers.
   - **Why:** Retraining ensures you control for confounds and can debug discrepancies.

3. **You're making a strong claim**
   - If your method beats the baseline by a small margin, reviewers will scrutinize whether the comparison is apples-to-apples.
   - **Why:** Retraining under identical conditions strengthens your claim and deflects "unfair comparison" critiques.

4. **You need error bars or significance tests**
   - Published papers often report single runs; you may want mean ± std over multiple seeds.
   - **Why:** Statistical rigor requires matched experimental conditions.

---

## **Hybrid approach (often best):**
- **Cite their numbers** for context and to anchor your work in the literature.
- **Retrain the baseline** under your exact setup and report both:
  - "Baseline X reported 85.2% [cite]. Under our setup, we reproduce 84.9 ± 0.3%."
- **Advantage:** Shows you're rigorous, helps readers assess generalization, and makes your comparison bulletproof.

---

## **Red flags that demand retraining:**
- You changed the dataset, even slightly (e.g., different train/val split, updated version).
- You're using different hardware (e.g., they used TPUs, you use GPUs—can affect batch size, mixed precision, etc.).
- The baseline paper is old and used outdated libraries (e.g., TensorFlow 1.x vs. PyTorch 2.x).
- You're submitting to a top venue where reviewers will expect controlled comparisons.

---

## **Practical advice:**
1. **Start by citing their numbers** in your draft.
2. **Retrain at least one key baseline** under your setup to validate the comparison.
3. **In the paper, be transparent:**
   - "We cite results from [X] for baselines A and B, and retrain baseline C under our setup for a controlled comparison."
   - Or: "We retrain all baselines under identical conditions (same seeds, hardware, hyperparameters) to ensure fair comparison."

---

**In short:** If your setup matches theirs closely and the baseline is standard, citing is fine. If there's *any* meaningful difference—or if you're making a strong claim—retrain to ensure a fair, controlled comparison. When in doubt, retrain at least one baseline and report both their published numbers and your reproduced results.

[Turn 4] USER:
How do I decide how many seeds to run if my lab only has two GPUs and reviewers keep asking for error bars?

[Turn 4] ASSISTANT:
This is a **very common constraint** in academic labs. Here's a practical strategy to balance rigor with limited compute:

---

## **1. Minimum viable rigor: 3–5 seeds**
- **3 seeds** is the bare minimum to report mean ± std and claim you've checked variance.
  - Enough to catch obvious instability (e.g., one run crashes or diverges).
  - Reviewers may grumble but usually accept it for expensive models.
- **5 seeds** is the sweet spot for most papers:
  - Gives a more stable estimate of mean and variance.
  - Standard in many ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
- **10+ seeds** is ideal but often impractical unless you have cheap/fast experiments.

**Recommendation for two GPUs:** Aim for **3–5 seeds** for your main results. Run them sequentially if needed (it's slower but doable).

---

## **2. Prioritize what you run multiple seeds on**
You don't need error bars on *everything*. Be strategic:

### **Must have multiple seeds:**
- **Your main method** vs. **key baselines** on the primary benchmark.
- **Ablation studies** that test your core claims (e.g., "does component X help?").
- Any result where the difference is small (< 2–3 percentage points).

### **Can get away with fewer/single runs:**
- **Well-established baselines** with known stable performance (cite prior work's variance if available).
- **Preliminary experiments** or exploratory results in appendix.
- **Qualitative analyses** (e.g., visualizations, case studies).
- **Scaling experiments** (e.g., "performance vs. model size")—report trends, note single-seed limitation.

---

## **3. Reduce cost per seed**
If each seed takes too long, optimize:

### **Smaller proxy tasks:**
- Run multi-seed experiments on a **smaller dataset** or **subset** (e.g., 10% of data, or a smaller benchmark in the same family).
- Report full-scale results with fewer seeds, proxy results with more seeds, and argue the variance transfers.
- Example: "We run 5 seeds on CIFAR-10 (std = 0.3%) and 3 seeds on ImageNet due to compute limits."

### **Shorter training:**
- Run seeds for fewer epochs if variance stabilizes early.
- Check if performance ranking holds at intermediate checkpoints (e.g., epoch 50 vs. 100).

### **Smaller models:**
- Validate your method on a smaller architecture with more seeds, then scale up with fewer seeds.
- Example: "We run 5 seeds for BERT-base and 3 seeds for BERT-large."

### **Efficient hyperparameter search:**
- Use a single seed for hyperparameter tuning, then run your best config with multiple seeds.
- Don't waste seeds on suboptimal hyperparameters.

---

## **4. Be transparent in the paper**
Reviewers appreciate honesty about compute constraints:

### **In the main text:**
- "We report mean ± std over 3 random seeds due to computational constraints."
- "We run 5 seeds for our main results (Table 1) and 3 seeds for ablations (Table 2)."

### **In the appendix/reproducibility statement:**
- Document exact seeds used (e.g., 42, 123, 456).
- Report per-seed results in a table so reviewers can see the raw variance.
- Mention GPU type, training time per seed, total compute budget.

### **If variance is low:**
- Highlight it! "Across 3 seeds, our method shows low variance (std < 0.2%), suggesting robustness."

### **If variance is high:**
- Acknowledge it and discuss: "We observe higher variance on task X (std = 1.2%), likely due to [small dataset / sensitive hyperparameters]. Future work could explore stabilization techniques."

---

## **5. Leverage sequential GPU usage**
With two GPUs, you can:
- **Run 2 seeds in parallel**, then queue the next batch.
- **Stagger experiments**: Start seed 1 on GPU 0, seed 2 on GPU 1. When seed 1 finishes, start seed 3 on GPU 0, etc.
- **Use job schedulers** (e.g., SLURM, tmux scripts) to automate queuing overnight/weekend runs.

**Time estimate example:**
- If one seed takes 24 hours, 5 seeds on 2 GPUs = ~3 days (2 parallel + 2 parallel + 1 solo).
- Plan experiments in batches: main results first, ablations second.

---

## **6. What to say to reviewers**
If they push back on 3 seeds:

> "We ran 3 seeds for all main experiments due to GPU constraints (2 GPUs, X hours per seed). The observed standard deviation is low (< Y%), and results are consistent across seeds. We provide per-seed results in Appendix Z for full transparency. We are happy to run additional seeds if the paper is accepted and we gain access to more compute."

Most reviewers will accept this if:
- You're transparent.
- The variance is reasonable.
- The performance gap is clear (not a 0.5% difference with 1% std).

---

## **7. When 3 seeds might not be enough**
- **High-variance tasks** (e.g., RL, small datasets, few-shot learning): Consider 5–10 seeds or report confidence intervals.
- **Tight performance margins**: If your method beats the baseline by 0.5% with std = 0.8%, you need more seeds or a different argument (e.g., qualitative benefits, efficiency).
- **Top-tier venues with strict standards**: ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR increasingly expect 5+ seeds for main results.

---

## **Practical recipe for two GPUs:**

| Experiment type | Seeds | Strategy |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| **Main method vs. top baseline** | 5 | Run sequentially, ~3 days |
| **Secondary baselines** | 3 | Cite prior work's variance if available |
| **Ablations (core claims)** | 3–5 | Prioritize the most important |
| **Ablations (minor)** | 1–3 | Note limitation in appendix |
| **Exploratory/qualitative** | 1 | No error bars needed |

---

## **Bottom line:**
- **3 seeds** is the minimum for main results; **5 is better** if you can afford it.
- **Prioritize** your core claims and key comparisons.
- **Optimize** cost per seed (smaller proxies, shorter training, smaller models).
- **Be transparent** about compute limits—reviewers are often sympathetic if you're rigorous within constraints.
- **Queue experiments smartly** on your two GPUs to maximize throughput.

With two GPUs and good planning, you can absolutely produce rigorous, publishable results with error bars. It just takes careful prioritization and a bit of patience.

[Turn 5] USER:
If I run 3 seeds but the std is still high, should I mention this upfront or wait for reviewers to ask?

[Turn 5] ASSISTANT:
**Mention it upfront.** Here's why and how:

---

## **Why you should be proactive:**

### **1. Builds trust**
- Transparency signals scientific integrity. Hiding high variance and hoping reviewers don't notice will backfire—they *will* notice, and it looks like you're trying to obscure a weakness.
- Proactively discussing it shows you understand the limitation and have thought critically about what it means.

### **2. Controls the narrative**
- If you address it first, you get to frame the interpretation:
  - Is the variance inherent to the task/dataset?
  - Does it affect the ranking of methods?
  - Are there mitigating factors (e.g., all methods show high variance)?
- If reviewers discover it themselves, they'll frame it as a flaw without your context.

### **3. Preempts harsher criticism**
- Reviewers are more lenient when you acknowledge limitations honestly.
- If you wait for them to ask, they may assume you didn't notice or didn't care—both bad looks.

### **4. Shows you're not cherry-picking**
- High variance + upfront reporting = "we ran the experiments honestly and reported what we found."
- High variance + silence = "did they run more seeds and only report the good ones?"

---

## **Where and how to mention it:**

### **In the main results section:**
Report the numbers with error bars as usual:
- "Our method achieves **85.3 ± 1.8%** (mean ± std over 3 seeds), compared to the baseline's **83.1 ± 0.9%**."

### **Add a brief interpretive sentence:**
Right after the table/figure, acknowledge and contextualize:

**Example 1 (variance is task-inherent):**
> "We observe relatively high variance across seeds (std ~1.5–2%), consistent with prior work on this dataset [cite if available]. This is likely due to the small size of the validation set (N=500). Importantly, our method outperforms the baseline in all three individual runs (see Appendix A)."

**Example 2 (variance doesn't affect conclusions):**
> "While standard deviation is higher than typical (std = 1.8%), our method's improvement over the baseline is statistically significant (p < 0.05, paired t-test) and holds across all seeds."

**Example 3 (variance is a known issue):**
> "We observe high variance (std = 2.1%), which is common in few-shot learning settings [cite]. To ensure robustness, we report per-seed results in Table X and confirm that our method ranks first in 3/3 seeds."

### **In the appendix:**
Provide full transparency:
- **Per-seed results table:** Show individual runs so reviewers can see the raw data.
- **Variance analysis:** Compare your variance to baselines. If the baseline also has high variance, that's important context.
- **Statistical tests:** If the difference is significant despite variance (e.g., t-test, bootstrap confidence intervals), report it.

**Example appendix table:**

| Method | Seed 1 | Seed 2 | Seed 3 | Mean ± Std |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Baseline | 82.5 | 83.9 | 82.9 | 83.1 ± 0.9 |
| Ours | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 ± 1.8 |

> "Our method outperforms the baseline in all three seeds, despite higher variance. The variance may stem from sensitivity to initialization in the attention module, which we plan to investigate in future work."

---

## **What to say (templates):**

### **If variance is task/data-inherent:**
> "The relatively high standard deviation (1.5–2%) is consistent with the small dataset size and has been observed in prior work [cite]. All methods exhibit similar variance, and our method consistently outperforms baselines across seeds."

### **If your method has higher variance than baselines:**
> "Our method shows higher variance (std = 1.8%) compared to the baseline (std = 0.9%), possibly due to [hypothesis: e.g., stochastic attention dropout, sensitivity to initialization]. However, the mean improvement is substantial (+2.2%) and holds across all individual runs. We leave variance reduction as future work."

### **If variance is high but you still win:**
> "Despite high variance (std = 2.1%), our method outperforms the baseline in all three seeds (min: 84.1%, max: 87.2% vs. baseline max: 83.9%). We provide per-seed results in Appendix A."

### **If you ran statistical tests:**
> "We observe std = 1.8% across 3 seeds. A paired t-test confirms the improvement is statistically significant (p = 0.03). We also report 95% bootstrap confidence intervals in Appendix B."

---

## **When high variance is actually a problem:**

### **Red flag scenarios:**
1. **Overlapping error bars with small differences:**
   - Your method: 85.3 ± 2.0%, Baseline: 84.1 ± 1.5%
   - The ranges overlap heavily; hard to claim a clear win.
   - **What to do:** Run more seeds if possible, or shift focus to other metrics (efficiency, qualitative benefits, specific subtasks where you win decisively).

2. **Inconsistent ranking across seeds:**
   - Seed 1: You win. Seed 2: Baseline wins. Seed 3: Tie.
   - **What to do:** Report this honestly and discuss why (e.g., "performance is sensitive to initialization; we recommend ensemble methods in practice").

3. **High variance only on your method:**
   - Baseline: 83.1 ± 0.5%, Yours: 85.3 ± 3.2%
   - Suggests your method is unstable.
   - **What to do:** Investigate and discuss. Is it a bug? A feature (e.g., exploration in RL)? Can you stabilize it (e.g., learning rate tuning, gradient clipping)?

---

## **What NOT to do:**

❌ **Hide it:** Don't report only the mean without std, or bury per-seed results in a footnote.  
❌ **Cherry-pick:** Don't run 10 seeds and report the best 3.  
❌ **Downplay dishonestly:** Don't say "variance is negligible" when std = 2% and the gap is 2.5%.  
❌ **Blame reviewers:** Don't say "we only had 2 GPUs" as an excuse for not investigating high variance—acknowledge the limitation and propose future work.

---

## **Reviewer response strategy:**

If a reviewer still pushes back:

> **Reviewer:** "The high variance undermines the claim of improvement."

> **Your rebuttal:**  
> "We appreciate the concern. We have added statistical significance tests (paired t-test, p=0.03) and per-seed results (Appendix A) showing our method wins in 3/3 seeds. The variance is comparable to prior work on this dataset [cite]. We also ran an additional 2 seeds (now 5 total) and the conclusion holds (updated Table 1: 85.1 ± 1.6% vs. 83.2 ± 1.0%). We have added discussion of variance sources and potential mitigation strategies in Section 4.3."

(If you can't run more seeds, focus on statistical tests, per-seed wins, and contextualizing variance.)

---

## **Bottom line:**

**Always mention high variance upfront.** Frame it constructively:
1. **Acknowledge it** in the main text.
2. **Contextualize it** (task-inherent? affects all methods? still significant?).
3. **Provide transparency** in the appendix (per-seed results, stats).
4. **Discuss implications** (does it matter? future work?).

Reviewers respect honesty and rigor. High variance + transparency = acceptable. High variance + silence = rejection risk.

[Turn 6] USER:
If I add two more seeds during rebuttal, is it okay to update only the mean/std or must I show every raw seed value?

[Turn 6] ASSISTANT:
**You should show the raw per-seed values**, at least in the appendix or rebuttal. Here's why and how to handle it:

---

## **Why you need to show raw values:**

### **1. Transparency and trust**
- Reviewers who asked for more seeds want to verify you actually ran them and didn't cherry-pick.
- Showing only updated mean ± std without raw data can raise suspicion: "Did they run 7 seeds and report the best 5?"
- Raw values prove you're being honest.

### **2. Reviewers can verify the math**
- They may want to check your std calculation or run their own statistical tests.
- If you only report aggregates, they can't validate your claims.

### **3. Shows consistency (or lack thereof)**
- If the new seeds are consistent with the original 3, that strengthens your case.
- If they're wildly different, reviewers need to see that to assess whether the original 3 were unrepresentative.

### **4. Standard practice in rebuttals**
- Most rebuttals that add experiments include full details (tables, per-run results) to demonstrate rigor.
- Reviewers expect this level of transparency when you're responding to their concerns.

---

## **How to present it in the rebuttal:**

### **Option A: Inline table (if space allows)**
```
We have run 2 additional seeds as requested. Updated results:

| Method   | Seed 1 | Seed 2 | Seed 3 | Seed 4 | Seed 5 | Mean ± Std |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Baseline | 82.5   | 83.9   | 82.9   | 83.2   | 83.1   | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
| Ours     | 84.1   | 87.2   | 84.6   | 85.3   | 84.9   | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

The additional seeds confirm our method's advantage (p=0.02, paired t-test). 
Variance decreased from ±1.8% (3 seeds) to ±1.2% (5 seeds), and our method 
outperforms the baseline in all 5 runs.
```

### **Option B: Summary + pointer to appendix**
```
We have run 2 additional seeds (now 5 total). Updated results:
- Baseline: 83.1 ± 0.5% (previously 83.1 ± 0.9%)
- Ours: 85.2 ± 1.2% (previously 85.3 ± 1.8%)

Per-seed results are in the table below. The improvement remains significant 
(p=0.02) and our method wins in 5/5 seeds.

[Include the per-seed table here or say "See revised Appendix A, Table X"]
```

### **Option C: Highlight the new seeds**
If you want to emphasize what changed:
```
Original 3 seeds: Ours = 84.1, 87.2, 84.6 (mean 85.3 ± 1.8%)
New seeds 4–5: Ours = 85.3, 84.9
Combined (5 seeds): Ours = 85.2 ± 1.2%

The new seeds fall within the original range, confirming stability. 
Full per-seed results for all methods are in Table R1 below.
```

---

## **What to update in the revised paper:**

### **Main text (Table/Figure):**
- Update the mean ± std to reflect 5 seeds.
- Add a footnote: "Updated from 3 to 5 seeds in revision."

### **Appendix:**
- Replace or expand the per-seed table to show all 5 seeds.
- **Label clearly:** "Table X: Per-seed results (5 random seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 101112)."

### **Reproducibility statement / experimental details:**
- Update: "We report mean ± std over 5 random seeds (originally 3; expanded to 5 during revision)."

---

## **What reviewers are checking:**

When you add seeds in rebuttal, reviewers will look for:

1. **Did the conclusion change?**
   - If your original 3-seed result was 85.3 ± 1.8% and the 5-seed result is 82.1 ± 3.5%, that's a problem.
   - If it's 85.2 ± 1.2%, that's reassuring (variance decreased, mean stable).

2. **Were the original seeds representative?**
   - If seeds 4–5 are wildly different from 1–3, it suggests the original sample was biased.
   - Showing raw values lets reviewers judge this.

3. **Did you cherry-pick?**
   - If you only show aggregates, they can't rule out that you ran 10 seeds and picked the best 5.
   - Raw values prove you ran exactly 5 and reported all of them.

---

## **Edge case: What if the new seeds hurt your results?**

### **Scenario:**
- Original 3 seeds: 84.1, 87.2, 84.6 → mean 85.3 ± 1.8%
- New seeds 4–5: 82.3, 83.1
- Combined 5 seeds: mean 84.3 ± 2.0%

### **What to do:**
**Still show the raw values.** Hiding them is worse than a slightly weaker result. Frame it constructively:

> "We ran 2 additional seeds as requested. The updated mean is 84.3 ± 2.0% (down from 85.3 ± 1.8% with 3 seeds), reflecting higher variance than initially observed. However, our method still outperforms the baseline (83.1 ± 0.5%) in 4 out of 5 seeds, and the difference remains statistically significant (p=0.04). The variance suggests sensitivity to initialization, which we now discuss in Section 4.3 and propose as future work."

**Why this works:**
- You're honest.
- You still have a valid result (4/5 wins, significant p-value).
- You acknowledge the limitation and contextualize it.

Reviewers will respect this more than if they suspect you're hiding something.

---

## **Minimal acceptable disclosure:**

If rebuttal space is extremely tight, the bare minimum is:

1. **Updated mean ± std** in the main response.
2. **Statement:** "Per-seed results for all 5 seeds are provided in the revised Appendix A, Table X."
3. **Actual table in the appendix** with all 5 raw values.

But ideally, include the table directly in the rebuttal so reviewers don't have to hunt for it.

---

## **Template rebuttal response:**

> **Reviewer 2:** "The high variance (std=1.8%) with only 3 seeds is concerning. Can you run more seeds?"

> **Our response:**  
> Thank you for this suggestion. We have run 2 additional seeds (now 5 total). Updated results are below:
>
> | Method   | Seed 1 | Seed 2 | Seed 3 | Seed 4 | Seed 5 | Mean ± Std |
> |----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
> | Baseline | 82.5   | 83.9   | 82.9   | 83.2   | 83.1   | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
> | Ours     | 84.1   | 87.2   | 84.6   | 85.3   | 84.9   | 85.2 ± 1.2 |
>
> Key observations:
> - The mean remains stable (85.2% vs. 85.3% originally).
> - Variance decreased (±1.2% vs. ±1.8%), suggesting the original 3 seeds were representative.
> - Our method outperforms the baseline in all 5 seeds.
> - The improvement is statistically significant (p=0.02, paired t-test).
>
> We have updated Table 1 and Appendix A in the revised manuscript to reflect these results.

---

## **Bottom line:**

**Show the raw per-seed values**, either in the rebuttal directly or in a clearly signposted appendix table. This:
- Proves you ran the seeds honestly.
- Lets reviewers verify your claims.
- Demonstrates scientific rigor.

Updating only the mean ± std without raw data will raise red flags. Transparency is your best defense, even if the new seeds are slightly worse than expected.

[Turn 7] USER:
Should I also include the exact random seeds I used in the rebuttal table?

[Turn 7] ASSISTANT:
**Yes, include the exact random seeds**—either in the rebuttal table or in the caption/footnote. Here's why and how:

---

## **Why you should include exact seeds:**

### **1. Full reproducibility**
- Listing the exact seeds (e.g., 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011) allows anyone to reproduce your exact results.
- This is increasingly expected at top venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and in reproducibility checklists.

### **2. Proves you didn't cherry-pick**
- If you say "we used seeds 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011," reviewers know you didn't run 20 seeds and pick the best 5.
- It shows you chose seeds systematically (e.g., sequential, or a standard set) rather than opportunistically.

### **3. Enables verification**
- Reviewers or future readers can re-run your exact experiments to verify the per-seed results.
- If someone gets different numbers with the same seeds, it flags a reproducibility issue (code bug, library version, etc.).

### **4. Standard practice**
- Many papers now include seed values in tables, captions, or reproducibility statements.
- Omitting them can look like an oversight or, worse, like you're hiding something.

## **Where to include them:**

### **Option A: In the table caption**
```
Table R1: Per-seed results for 5 random seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011).

| Method   | Seed 1 | Seed 2 | Seed 3 | Seed 4 | Seed 5 | Mean ± Std |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Baseline | 82.5   | 83.9   | 82.9   | 83.2   | 83.1   | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
| Ours     | 84.1   | 87.2   | 84.6   | 85.3   | 84.9   | 85.2 ± 1.2 |
```

### **Option B: As column headers**
```
| Method   | 42   | 123  | 456  | 789  | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| Baseline | 82.5 | 83.9 | 82.9 | 83.2 | 83.1 | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
| Ours     | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |
```
*(This is clearer and more explicit.)*

### **Option C: In the text before the table**
```
We ran 2 additional seeds (789, 1011) to supplement the original 3 (42, 123, 456). 
Results for all 5 seeds are below:

[table]
```

### **Option D: Footnote (if space is tight)**
```
Table R1: Per-seed results.*

| Method   | Seed 1 | Seed 2 | Seed 3 | Seed 4 | Seed 5 | Mean ± Std |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Baseline | 82.5   | 83.9   | 82.9   | 83.2   | 83.1   | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
| Ours     | 84.1   | 87.2   | 84.6   | 85.3   | 84.9   | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

*Random seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011.
```

---

## **Best practice for the rebuttal:**

Use **Option B (seeds as column headers)** or **Option A (caption)** in the rebuttal table. Example:

> **Reviewer 2:** "Please run more seeds."
>
> **Our response:**  
> We have run 2 additional seeds. Updated results (seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011):
>
> | Method   | 42   | 123  | 456  | 789  | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
> |----------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
> | Baseline | 82.5 | 83.9 | 82.9 | 83.2 | 83.1 | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
> | Ours     | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |
>
> Our method outperforms the baseline in all 5 seeds (p=0.02). We have updated the manuscript accordingly.

---

## **What to include in the revised paper:**

### **Main text / Experimental setup section:**
```
We report mean ± standard deviation over 5 random seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011) 
for all main experiments. Per-seed results are provided in Appendix A.
```

### **Appendix table:**
Include the full per-seed table with seeds clearly labeled (as in Option B above).

### **Code release (if applicable):**
```python
# In your training script or README:
SEEDS = [42, 123, 456, 789, 1011]
```

---

## **Common seed choices:**

You can use any seeds, but common practices include:

1. **Sequential from a standard starting point:**
   - 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 (or 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
   - Simple, systematic, no cherry-picking.

2. **Spaced-out values:**
   - 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011
   - Reduces risk of correlated randomness (though this is rarely an issue in practice).

3. **Standard ML seeds:**
   - 42, 1337, 2020, 2021, 2022
   - Somewhat arbitrary but commonly seen in papers.

**What matters:** Pick them *before* running experiments and stick to them. Don't run 10 seeds and then report "we used seeds 42, 87, 123, 201, 456" if you actually tried 0–9 and picked the best.

---

## **What if you already ran the original 3 seeds but didn't record which seeds you used?**

### **If you can reconstruct them:**
- Check your logs, config files, or code commits.
- If you find them, report them honestly.

### **If you can't reconstruct them:**
- **Be honest in the rebuttal:**
  > "We unfortunately did not record the exact seed values for the original 3 runs. For the 2 additional runs, we used seeds 789 and 1011. In the revised manuscript, we have re-run all 5 experiments with seeds 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011 to ensure full reproducibility. Updated results are below: [table]."

- **Re-run all 5 if possible** to provide a clean, reproducible set.
- If you can't re-run (e.g., experiments are too expensive), acknowledge the limitation:
  > "The original 3 seeds were not recorded (an oversight we have corrected in our lab practices). The 2 new seeds are 789 and 1011. We provide these values and commit to releasing code with fixed seeds for reproducibility."

---

## **Red flags to avoid:**

❌ **Vague language:** "We used random seeds" (which ones?)  
❌ **Inconsistent seeds:** Reporting different seeds in the rebuttal vs. revised paper.  
❌ **Suspiciously "nice" results:** If all your seeds give nearly identical results, reviewers may wonder if you actually varied the seed properly.  
❌ **Changing seeds between rebuttal and camera-ready:** If you report seeds in the rebuttal, those must match the final paper.

---

## **Example of full transparency (gold standard):**

**Rebuttal:**
> We have run 2 additional seeds (789, 1011) as requested. Combined with the original seeds (42, 123, 456), results are:
>
> | Method   | 42   | 123  | 456  | 789  | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
> |----------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
> | Baseline | 82.5 | 83.9 | 82.9 | 83.2 | 83.1 | 83.1 ± 0.5 |
> | Ours     | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

**Revised paper (Appendix):**
> **Table A1:** Per-seed results on [Dataset]. We use random seeds {42, 123, 456, 789, 1011} for all experiments. Code to reproduce these exact results is available at [URL].

**Code (config.py):**
```python
SEEDS = [42, 123, 456, 789, 1011]  # Fixed seeds for reproducibility
```

---

## **Bottom line:**

**Yes, include the exact random seeds** in your rebuttal table (as column headers or in the caption) and in the revised paper's appendix. This:
- Ensures full reproducibility.
- Proves you didn't cherry-pick.
- Meets modern standards for transparency.

If you didn't record the original seeds, acknowledge it and either re-run with documented seeds or provide the new seeds and commit to better practices going forward. Reviewers value honesty and rigor over perfection.

[Turn 8] USER:
If I list the seeds in the rebuttal, do reviewers expect the same order in the camera-ready?

[Turn 8] ASSISTANT:
**Yes, you should keep the same order** (and the same seeds) between the rebuttal and camera-ready. Here's why and what to watch out for:

---

## **Why order and seeds must match:**

### **1. Reviewers may spot-check**
- Some reviewers take notes or screenshots of rebuttal tables.
- If they notice the seeds changed order—or worse, the *values* shifted—it raises red flags:
  - "Did they re-run and get different results?"
  - "Did they cherry-pick after the rebuttal?"
  - "Is there a reproducibility issue?"

### **2. Consistency signals rigor**
- Matching seeds and order shows you ran the experiments once, reported them honestly, and didn't fiddle with anything post-rebuttal.
- Any discrepancy (even innocent) can undermine trust.

### **3. Reproducibility**
- If someone tries to reproduce "Seed 1" from your paper, they expect it to correspond to the same seed value you reported in the rebuttal.
- Changing the order breaks this mapping.

---

## **What "same order" means:**

If your rebuttal table is:

| Method   | 42   | 123  | 456  | 789  | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| Ours     | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

Then your camera-ready appendix should have:

| Method   | 42   | 123  | 456  | 789  | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| Ours     | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

**Not:**

| Method   | 42   | 456  | 123  | 789  | 1011 | Mean ± Std |  ← Reordered!
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| Ours     | 84.1 | 84.6 | 87.2 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

Even though the mean/std are the same, the reordering can confuse or alarm reviewers.

---

## **What if you need to change something?**

### **Scenario 1: You found a bug and need to re-run**
If you discover a bug *after* the rebuttal and need to re-run all experiments:

**What to do:**
1. **Contact the area chair / program chair immediately.**
   - Explain the issue: "We discovered a bug in [data preprocessing / evaluation script]. We have re-run all experiments with the same seeds and the conclusions remain unchanged."
   - Ask for guidance: "May we update the camera-ready with corrected results?"

2. **In the camera-ready, add a footnote:**
   > "After the rebuttal, we discovered a minor bug in [X]. We re-ran all experiments with the same seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011). Updated results are reported here; the conclusions are unchanged. Original rebuttal results: [mean ± std]."

3. **Show both sets of numbers if the change is non-trivial:**
   - Rebuttal: 85.2 ± 1.2%
   - Camera-ready (corrected): 85.0 ± 1.3%
   - This transparency shows you're not hiding anything.

**When this is acceptable:**
- The bug is genuine and documented.
- The conclusions don't change (e.g., you still outperform the baseline).
- You're upfront about it.

**When this is risky:**
- The new results weaken your claims significantly.
- You can't clearly explain what the bug was.
- You didn't notify the chairs.

---

### **Scenario 2: You want to add more seeds**
If you want to expand from 5 to 10 seeds for the camera-ready:

**What to do:**
1. **Keep the original 5 seeds in the same order.**
2. **Append the new seeds:**

**Rebuttal (5 seeds):**
| Method | 42 | 123 | 456 | 789 | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
|--------|----|----|----|----|------|------------|
| Ours   | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |

**Camera-ready (10 seeds):**
| Method | 42 | 123 | 456 | 789 | 1011 | 2022 | 2023 | 3141 | 5678 | 9999 | Mean ± Std |
|--------|----|----|----|----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| Ours   | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.0 | 84.7 | 85.5 | 84.3 | 85.1 | 85.0 ± 0.9 |

3. **Add a note in the caption or text:**
   > "We expanded from 5 seeds (reported in rebuttal) to 10 seeds for the camera-ready. The first 5 seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011) match the rebuttal exactly."

**Why this works:**
- The original 5 are unchanged and in the same order.
- The additional seeds show you're going above and beyond.
- Reviewers can verify the first 5 match their notes.

---

### **Scenario 3: You want to reorder for aesthetic reasons**
Maybe you want to sort seeds numerically (42, 123, 456, 789, 1011) or by performance (worst to best).

**Recommendation: Don't do it.**
- The risk of confusion outweighs any aesthetic benefit.
- If you *must* reorder, add a footnote:
  > "Seeds are sorted numerically in this table. The mapping to rebuttal Table R1 is: Seed 42 (rebuttal Seed 1), Seed 123 (rebuttal Seed 2), etc."

But honestly, just keep the original order. It's not worth the hassle.

---

## **What if you didn't list seeds in the rebuttal?**

If your rebuttal only said:
> "We ran 2 additional seeds. Updated mean: 85.2 ± 1.2%."

And you didn't specify which seeds, then you have flexibility in the camera-ready. But you should still:
1. **Pick a fixed set of seeds** (e.g., 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011).
2. **Document them clearly** in the camera-ready.
3. **Ensure the mean ± std match** what you reported in the rebuttal.

If the rebuttal said 85.2 ± 1.2% and the camera-ready says 85.0 ± 1.3%, add a note:
> "The slight difference from the rebuttal (85.2 ± 1.2%) is due to rounding; the underlying per-seed results are identical."

Or, if you re-ran:
> "We re-ran all 5 seeds for the camera-ready to ensure reproducibility. Results are consistent with the rebuttal (85.2 ± 1.2% vs. 85.0 ± 1.3%)."

---

## **Practical advice:**

### **Do:**
✅ Keep the same seeds in the same order between rebuttal and camera-ready.  
✅ If you add more seeds, append them and note the expansion.  
✅ If you must change something, document it clearly and notify the chairs if it's significant.  
✅ Ensure mean ± std match (within rounding error).

### **Don't:**
❌ Reorder seeds without explanation.  
❌ Change seed values (e.g., swap 789 for 800) without re-running and documenting.  
❌ Report different per-seed results for the same seed ID.  
❌ Silently "improve" results between rebuttal and camera-ready.

---

## **Example of acceptable evolution:**

**Rebuttal:**
> We ran 2 additional seeds (789, 1011). Results for seeds 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011:
> - Ours: 84.1, 87.2, 84.6, 85.3, 84.9 → mean 85.2 ± 1.2%

**Camera-ready (Appendix A):**
> **Table A1:** Per-seed results (seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1011).
>
> | Method | 42 | 123 | 456 | 789 | 1011 | Mean ± Std |
> |--------|----|----|----|----|------|------------|
> | Ours   | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.2 ± 1.2 |
>
> These results match those reported in the rebuttal.

**Camera-ready (optional expansion to 10 seeds):**
> **Table A1:** Per-seed results. We expanded from 5 seeds (rebuttal) to 10 seeds (camera-ready). The first 5 seeds match the rebuttal exactly.
>
> | Method | 42 | 123 | 456 | 789 | 1011 | 2022 | 2023 | 3141 | 5678 | 9999 | Mean ± Std |
> |--------|----|----|----|----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------------|
> | Ours   | 84.1 | 87.2 | 84.6 | 85.3 | 84.9 | 85.0 | 84.7 | 85.5 | 84.3 | 85.1 | 85.0 ± 0.9 |

---

## **Bottom line:**

**Yes, keep the same seeds in the same order** between rebuttal and camera-ready. Any changes (reordering, new seeds, different values) should be:
1. **Documented clearly** (footnote, caption, or text).
2. **Justified** (e.g., "expanded to 10 seeds," "corrected a bug").
3. **Transparent** (show what changed and why).

When in doubt, **don't change anything**. Consistency between rebuttal and camera-ready signals rigor and honesty, which reviewers and readers value highly.
