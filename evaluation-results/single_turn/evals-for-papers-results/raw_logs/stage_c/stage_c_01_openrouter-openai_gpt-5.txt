1. Problem framing and goals
- Objective: Develop and evaluate graph neural network (GNN) methods for sea ice analysis across three scales: (A) pan-Arctic spatiotemporal forecasting of concentration and ice edge, (B) floe-scale interaction and collision dynamics from SAR-derived tracks, and (C) fast emulation/parameter tuning of dynamic–thermodynamic sea ice models on unstructured meshes. Prior work indicates multi-scale graph modeling can improve Arctic sea ice prediction [1], floe interactions can be framed as particle collisions on graphs [2], and graph surrogates can efficiently emulate finite-element/mesh-based simulators [7,9]. RGPS-based deformation statistics provide rigorous evaluation targets for dynamics and lead/ridge processes [4–6].
- Deliverables: (i) Open, reproducible codebase; (ii) benchmarked models and baselines; (iii) pan-Arctic forecast skill and ice-edge metrics; (iv) floe-collision prediction and deformation-statistics fidelity; (v) emulator speed/accuracy tradeoffs enabling parameter tuning workflows.
- Scientific stakes: Better short-to-subseasonal forecasts and interpretable, fast surrogates could improve hazard prediction (leads/ridges), shipping route planning, and model calibration. Evidence-backed evaluation will use established ice-edge and RGPS deformation metrics [1,4–6] and published floe-tracking pipelines [3,10].

2. Experiments
Experiment 1: Multi-scale spatiotemporal GNN for sea ice concentration (SIC) and ice-edge forecasting (1–30 days)
- Hypothesis: Multi-scale graph modeling over geodesic/mesh graphs with learned cross-scale edges improves SIC and ice-edge forecast skill vs. persistence, CNN/LSTM, and non-graph baselines, consistent with recent pan-Arctic graph modeling results [1].
- Setup:
  - Graph: Nodes = grid cells (25 km OSI-SAF/NSIDC); Edges = k-NN geodesic + dynamic edges via correlation/attention; Multi-scale via pooled coarser graphs.
  - Inputs: SIC, SIC uncertainty, ancillary forcings (10 m winds, 2 m air temp, ocean surface currents, SST, sea level pressure), sea ice thickness (if available). Conditioning on calendar/seasonal phase.
  - Model: Spatiotemporal GNN (message passing + temporal attention), with cross-scale fusion; residual losses for anomaly forecasting; optional physics-guided features (freezing degree days).
  - Training: 2002–2018, validate 2019, test 2020–2023; strict forward-in-time split to avoid leakage.
- Baselines: Persistence; climatology; UNet+ConvLSTM; GraphWaveNet; Graph Transformer (grid treated as graph). Include a naive linear autoregressor to contextualize gains.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - SIC RMSE and anomaly correlation.
  - Ice edge location error (mean great-circle distance between 15% contour lines).
  - Brier score / reliability for probabilistic ice presence; CRPS for probabilistic SIC.
  - Regional skill stratification (e.g., marginal ice zone vs. interior).
- Expected outcomes: GNN improves ice-edge distance and anomaly correlation over persistence and CNN/LSTM at 3–10 day horizons, in line with multi-scale graph modeling benefits reported for Arctic sea ice prediction [1]. If gains are small in summer, investigate regime-conditioned models.

Experiment 2: Floe-level interaction GNN for collision and velocity-change prediction from SAR tracks
- Hypothesis: Modeling floes as nodes with proximity/contact edges enables accurate prediction of imminent collisions and post-collision velocity/heading changes, outperforming non-graph sequence models and simple inelastic-collision heuristics [2,3,10].
- Setup:
  - Data: Sentinel-1 SAR sequences; floe tracks and shapes via Ice Floe Tracker and/or optical methods; optionally super-resolved motion fields for sub-pixel drift [3,10].
  - Graph: Nodes = floes with geometry/kinematics; Edges = Delaunay/k-NN within 2–5 floe diameters; features include relative velocities, size ratios, separation.
  - Model: Message-passing GNN with two heads: (i) edge-level collision probability within Δt (6–24 h) and (ii) node-level Δv, Δheading regression post-collision.
  - Training: Arctic sectors and seasons split to test generalization; augment with synthetic collisions from agent-based simulators when rare-event scarcity is severe.
- Baselines: LSTM/Transformer on per-floe sequences; social-force model; analytical inelastic collision predictor; random forest on pairwise features.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Collision classification AUROC, precision–recall (rare-event focus).
  - MAE/RMSE of velocity/heading change; continuity metrics (track breaks).
  - Deformation statistics matched to RGPS benchmarks (divergence, shear PDFs, intermittency) in regions reconstructed from floe motions [4–6].
- Expected outcomes: GNN yields higher precision–recall for imminent collisions and better Δv prediction vs. non-graph baselines; deformation-statistics alignment improves vs. heuristics [2,4–6]. Note: Ground truth collisions may be noisy; report confidence intervals.

Experiment 3: MeshGraphNet surrogate for sea-ice dynamics to emulate stress–strain and deformation
- Hypothesis: A mesh/graph GNN can emulate a continuum sea-ice dynamic core (e.g., EVP/EB rheology) with substantial speedup while preserving key deformation statistics when forced with realistic winds/currents [7,9].
- Setup:
  - Data: Paired inputs/outputs from a high-resolution sea-ice model (e.g., neXtSIM/DEMSI/CICE) on unstructured meshes for 5–10 Arctic years. Inputs: winds, ocean stress, thermodynamic terms; Targets: velocity, internal stress, deformation (divergence/shear).
  - Model: MeshGraphNet or similar graph-PDE surrogate with edge operators approximating gradient/divergence; physics-informed losses penalizing mass/momentum imbalance; optional boundary-condition conditioning.
  - Training: Train on subsets of years/regions; test on withheld seasons and on Antarctic to assess domain shift.
- Baselines: UNet surrogate on lat–lon grids; reduced-order linear model; kernel regression with local stencils.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Field-wise RMSE/MAE for velocity/stress; spectral error over scales.
  - RGPS-style deformation statistics (PDFs of divergence/shear, scaling exponents) [4–6].
  - Emulator wall-clock speedup and energy-to-solution vs. simulator.
- Expected outcomes: 10–100× speedup with subdominant increase in RMSE vs. simulator, while retaining first-order deformation statistics within tolerance windows, consistent with graph surrogates for finite-element physics [7,9]. If statistics drift, add constraints or multi-task training.

Experiment 4: Parameter tuning/data assimilation with GNN-in-the-loop
- Hypothesis: A fast GNN surrogate enables efficient tuning of rheology/drag parameters against RGPS deformation and ice-edge targets, reducing simulation–observation mismatch vs. default parameters [8].
- Setup:
  - Use Emulator (Exp. 3) inside Bayesian optimization or gradient-based calibration loops targeting multi-objective losses: RGPS deformation PDFs/scalings, ice-edge location error, and velocity RMSE [4–6].
  - Optionally hybrid DA: surrogate provides forecast operator in EnKF/4D-Var for short-window assimilation of SIC and motion vectors.
- Baselines: Tuning with full simulator (feasible for small windows); simpler ML surrogates (UNet).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Reduction in multi-objective loss vs. default; generalization to withheld periods.
  - Post-tuning forecast skill for SIC/edge and deformation stats.
- Expected outcomes: Improved deformation-statistics fidelity and edge skill vs. untuned model within practical compute budgets, aligning with ML-based parameter tuning evidence [8]. If surrogate bias misleads tuning, regularize with small numbers of truth simulations.

- Non-stationarity across seasons/regions
  - Mitigations: Regime-aware conditioning; domain-adaptive normalization; pretrain on long climatologies; evaluate per-region/per-season splits [1].
- Graph scale and memory limits on high-res meshes
  - Mitigations: Neighbor sampling, subgraph training, sparse attention, multi-scale pooling, mixed precision; partitioned inference [7].
- Surrogate bias leading to miscalibrated parameter tuning
