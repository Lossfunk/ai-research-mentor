1. Problem framing and goals
- Objective: Design, pilot, and rigorously evaluate a federated learning (FL) program tailored to low-resource and LMIC settings, where bandwidth is scarce, connectivity is intermittent, devices are heterogeneous, and data sovereignty/privacy constraints are strict. We target communication robustness, privacy-by-design, and equitable performance across sites.
- Scope and application tracks:
  - Track A (imaging): cross-silo FL for clinical imaging triage/quality control using small on-prem nodes.
  - Track B (tabular/text): cross-silo FL for primary-care risk prediction or stock-out forecasting at clinics.
- Success criteria (6 months):
  - Technical: Achieve within 2–5 percentage points of a centralized-training upper bound while reducing uplink by ≥5× via compression/async protocols; maintain training despite 30–50% client dropouts per round [1][3].
  - Privacy: Provide documented client-level privacy guarantees (ε, δ) and secure aggregation, with governance-aligned SOPs [4].
  - Equity: Narrow worst-site performance gap by ≥20% via personalization under non-IID data [2].
- Rationale: Federated averaging is the canonical baseline for decentralized training but struggles under non-IID data and irregular participation; proximal and asynchronous/personalized methods address these realities common in LMIC deployments [1][2][3]. Health data FL demands explicit privacy-preserving practices and governance even when data never leaves sites [4]. Resource constraints in Africa/LMICs further motivate edge-friendly training, sparse/quantized updates, and offline-first protocols [5].

2. Experiments
Experiment 1: Connectivity-robust FL under low bandwidth and intermittent participation
- Hypothesis: Asynchronous FL with update compression achieves near-FedAvg accuracy while tolerating 30–50% client dropouts and reducing uplink bytes by ≥5× versus vanilla FedAvg [1][3].
- Setup:
  - Design: 6–10 sites (or emulated nodes) with heterogeneous data sizes; simulate 2G/3G uplink (64–512 kbps) and daily outages. Use Flower or comparable framework with async server and buffered updates; apply Top-K sparsification (e.g., 1–5%), 8-bit quantization, and periodic error feedback.
  - Optimizers: Compare FedAvg, FedProx (μ∈{0.001, 0.01}) and an asynchronous FL variant with stale update handling [1][2][3].
  - Tasks: One imaging (e.g., small chest X-ray triage proxy) and one tabular (e.g., risk stratification) using public datasets partitioned non-IID to mirror site differences.
- Baselines: Centralized training upper bound; FedAvg synchronous (no compression).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Global: AUROC/F1/accuracy on a held-out IID test set; convergence rounds and wall-clock to reach a target metric.
  - Systems: Uplink bytes per round; rounds completed per day; staleness distribution; availability-adjusted throughput.
  - Robustness: Performance with 0%, 30%, 50% random client unavailability per round.
- Expected outcomes: Async+compression closes ≥80–95% of the gap to FedAvg accuracy, with ≥5× lower uplink and graceful degradation under 30–50% dropouts, consistent with asynchronous FL under irregular clients [1][3].

Experiment 2: Personalization for non-IID data and equity across sites
- Hypothesis: Personalized FL (proximal regularization + local last-layer tuning) reduces worst-site error by ≥20% vs. a single global model under severe label/feature shift [2].
- Setup:
  - Data partitions: Label skew and feature shift across sites; hold-out per-site test sets.
  - Methods: FedProx (μ sweep), local fine-tuning of last layer after each global round, and simple per-site adapters (e.g., LoRA on final layers) composed with the global backbone.
- Baselines: Global FedAvg model evaluated per site.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Equity: Worst-site and median-site AUROC/F1; Gini coefficient of per-site performance; calibration error per site.
  - Stability: Variance across rounds; catastrophic forgetting of minority sites.
- Expected outcomes: Personalized methods improve tail-site metrics with minimal loss in global average, consistent with proximal/personalized FL literature for heterogeneous clients [2][3].

Experiment 3: Privacy–utility trade-offs with client-level DP and secure aggregation
- Hypothesis: Client-level DP (per-client clipping + Gaussian noise) and secure aggregation can achieve ε≤5 (δ=1e−5) over the 6-month training window with ≤2–4 point absolute performance drop vs. non-private FL, meeting common health-privacy expectations [4].
- Setup:
  - Implement client gradient clipping and noise addition targeting cumulative ε budgets; use secure aggregation (cryptographic protocol) on the server for update aggregation.
  - Sweep noise multipliers to map utility vs. privacy frontier.
- Baselines: Non-private FL (no clipping/noise), and clipping-only.
- Evaluation metrics: Task performance; privacy accounting (ε, δ) across rounds; update leakage proxies (membership inference risk, if feasible).
- Expected outcomes: A measured privacy–utility curve enabling policy selection; secure aggregation eliminates server visibility of raw updates and reduces risk of inadvertent disclosure in healthcare contexts [4].

Experiment 4: Cost/energy-aware client selection for edge devices
- Hypothesis: Energy-aware client selection (choose participants by residual battery/solar charge and historical contribution diversity) cuts per-round energy by ≥25% without degrading convergence compared to random selection under the same participation cap [5].
- Setup:
  - Hardware: Mix of Jetson Nano/Raspberry Pi–class nodes with inexpensive power meters; intermittent power emulation.
  - Schedulers: Random-K clients vs. energy-aware (score by predicted marginal utility × available energy).
- Baselines: Random client sampling at fixed K.
- Evaluation metrics: Energy (Wh) per round; model quality over time; fraction of rounds skipped due to low power; device fatigue balance.
- Expected outcomes: Reduced energy per round and fewer “dead” devices participating under energy-aware scheduling, aligning with edge constraints emphasized for Africa/LMIC deployments [5].

4. Resources (compute, tools, datasets)
- Hardware and networking
  - Server: 1 modest GPU or CPU-only VM with reliable storage and TLS termination.
  - Clients: 6–10 edge nodes (Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 4 with 4–8 GB RAM), 4G routers, offline cache (ext4 SSD), and simple power monitors.
- Software
  - FL framework: Flower (lightweight, research-friendly; supports heterogeneous clients and custom strategies) [6].
  - Privacy: Secure aggregation implementation; DP accounting library (e.g., moments accountant).
  - MLOps: Git + CI; Prometheus/Grafana for rounds/uptime; encrypted logging; device management via MDM or Ansible.
- Datasets (public, to prototype before real data)
  - Imaging proxy: Public chest X-ray datasets (non-IID partitions) to emulate cross-site distribution; small ultrasound proxy if relevant.
  - Tabular proxy: Open health or logistics datasets (e.g., risk prediction, stock-out forecasting) partitioned by “site.”
  - Note: We did not find a high-confidence, peer-reviewed LMIC-specific FL dataset via the quick search. To strengthen evidence, we will curate non-IID site partitions from public datasets and document partition statistics; in parallel, draft a DUA for limited local data access.
- Security/governance
  - Threat modeling, DPIA, and SOPs for incident response and key management; consent and transparency materials aligned with local regulations [4].

5. Risks and mitigations table
- Intermittent connectivity and power outages disrupt rounds
  - Mitigations: Asynchronous FL with buffered updates, resumable uploads, and opportunistic participation; SMS/USSD out-of-band control channel [3][5].
- Severe non-IID data hurts global model utility at minority sites
  - Mitigations: FedProx and local adapters; equity-aware evaluation and per-site calibration; optional site-specific thresholds [2].
- Privacy expectations unmet (regulators/ethics)
  - Mitigations: Client-level DP with explicit ε/δ, secure aggregation, and strict server hardening; governance documentation and audits [4].
- Limited bandwidth inflates costs/time
  - Mitigations: Update sparsification/quantization; fewer but larger local steps; periodic aggregation windows; model distillation for small models [1][3][5].
- Model poisoning or data integrity attacks
  - Mitigations: Robust aggregation (median/Krum), anomaly detection on updates, client attestation, and rate limits.
- Organizational buy-in and capacity
  - Mitigations: Training for local IT/clinicians; co-design workshops; simple dashboards demonstrating value (uptime, local performance).
- Framework gaps or instability
  - Mitigations: Start with Flower; keep interfaces modular to swap strategies; integration tests and rollbacks [6].

6. Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Split learning for ultra-thin clients (send activations, not gradients) to further reduce bandwidth; compare to FL.
- Personalization with lightweight adapters (LoRA) within FL to improve on-device specialization without bloating uplink.
- Semi-supervised FL: self-training or consistency regularization using plentiful unlabeled local data.
- Scheduling via reinforcement learning to optimize participation under bandwidth/energy constraints.
- Cross-border FL with data sovereignty controls and per-jurisdiction policies; audit trails for compliance.

Note on evidence scope: [6] provides general framework discussion rather than LMIC-specific trials; we use it to justify tool selection. For stronger LMIC field evidence, we will document a pilot protocol and seek site collaborations; we did not find peer-reviewed, LMIC-specific FL RCTs in the quick scan.

Optional next step
- Approve Month 1 setup (governance + testbed) and the Experiment 1 protocol; we will deliver a week-2 dry run demonstrating async+compressed FL operating over a throttled 3G link with end-to-end metrics collection.
