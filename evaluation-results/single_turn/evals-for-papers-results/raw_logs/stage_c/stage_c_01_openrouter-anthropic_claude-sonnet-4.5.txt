Based on the retrieved literature, I can now construct a comprehensive research execution plan. The search revealed recent work on GNNs for sea ice [1,2], established benchmarks like IceNet [5,6], and key physics considerations [4].

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Core Problem:**  
Sea ice dynamics exhibit strong spatial dependencies (advection, ridging, lead formation) and temporal evolution governed by thermodynamic and mechanical processes. Traditional numerical models (e.g., CICE, neXtSIM) are computationally expensive; existing deep learning approaches (CNNs, U-Nets) struggle to capture long-range spatial interactions and physical constraints. Graph Neural Networks offer a promising framework to model sea ice as a spatially irregular, interconnected system while potentially incorporating conservation laws.

**Primary Goals:**
1. Develop a physics-informed GNN architecture for sub-seasonal (1–30 day) sea ice concentration and thickness forecasting
2. Benchmark against IceNet [5,6] (current state-of-the-art DL baseline) and operational models
3. Demonstrate improved spatial coherence and physical plausibility compared to pixel-wise CNN approaches
4. Quantify computational efficiency gains over numerical sea ice models

**Scientific Contributions:**
- Novel graph construction strategy encoding sea ice physics (momentum exchange, thickness distribution)
- Hybrid GNN incorporating conservation laws as inductive biases [2]
- Ablation studies isolating benefits of graph structure vs. physics constraints
- Open-source benchmark suite for GNN-based sea ice forecasting

## 2. Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Graph Construction and Representation Learning**

**Hypothesis:**  
Adaptive graph structures that encode spatial proximity, ocean currents, and atmospheric forcing will outperform fixed grid-based representations for sea ice concentration forecasting.

**Setup:**
- **Input data:** Daily sea ice concentration (SIC), thickness, surface temperature, wind vectors, ocean currents from NSIDC MASAM2 [3] and ERA5 reanalysis (2000–2023)
- **Graph construction strategies:**
  - *Baseline:* k-NN spatial graph (k=8) on regular lat-lon grid
  - *Variant A:* Adaptive radius graph weighted by ocean current magnitude
  - *Variant B:* Multi-scale hierarchical graph (local + regional connectivity)
  - *Variant C:* Dynamic graph with edge weights from learned attention
- **Architecture:** 6-layer GraphSAGE with edge features, hidden dim=128
- **Training:** 2000–2018 train, 2019–2020 validation, 2021–2023 test
- **Forecast horizon:** 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days

**Baselines:**
- IceNet (U-Net + ensemble) [5,6]
- ConvLSTM (spatiotemporal CNN baseline)
- Persistence model
- Linear trend extrapolation

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Binary accuracy (ice/no-ice at 15% threshold)
- Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE) in km
- Sea Ice Extent (SIE) bias and RMSE
- Spatial Information Divergence (SID) for spatial coherence
- Brier Skill Score relative to climatology

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Multi-scale graph (Variant B) should reduce IIEE by 15–25% vs. k-NN baseline
- Adaptive graphs (Variant A, C) improve performance in marginal ice zone (MIZ) where dynamics dominate
- All GNN variants maintain better spatial coherence (lower SID) than ConvLSTM

### **Experiment 2: Physics-Informed GNN with Conservation Laws**

**Hypothesis:**  
Incorporating momentum and mass conservation as soft constraints in the loss function will improve physical plausibility and forecast skill, especially for sea ice thickness and velocity predictions.

**Setup:**
- **Architecture:** Message-passing GNN with separate branches for:
  - Concentration evolution (thermodynamics)
  - Thickness distribution (mechanical redistribution)
  - Velocity field (momentum balance)
- **Physics constraints** (following [2]):
  - Mass conservation: ∂(concentration)/∂t + ∇·(concentration × velocity) = thermodynamic source
  - Momentum balance: simplified viscous-plastic rheology as graph diffusion
  - Thickness redistribution: ridging/rafting parameterized via edge aggregation
- **Loss function:**  
  L = L_data (MSE on observations) + λ_phys × L_physics (residuals of conservation equations) + λ_reg × L_regularization
- **Ablation:** Vary λ_phys ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0} to quantify physics constraint impact

**Baselines:**
- Best graph from Experiment 1 without physics constraints (λ_phys=0)
- IceNet [5,6]
- PIOMAS (numerical model output for thickness)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Thickness RMSE and bias vs. ICESat-2/CryoSat-2 altimetry
- Velocity correlation with NSIDC Polar Pathfinder drift product
- Physics residual magnitude (quantify violation of conservation laws)
- Energy spectrum analysis (check for spurious small-scale noise)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Optimal λ_phys ≈ 0.5–1.0 balances data fit and physical consistency
- Physics-informed GNN reduces thickness RMSE by 10–20% vs. data-only training
- Velocity predictions show higher spatial correlation (r > 0.7) in pack ice regions
- Conservation law residuals 2–3× smaller than unconstrained model

### **Experiment 3: Uncertainty Quantification and Probabilistic Forecasting**

**Hypothesis:**  
Ensemble GNNs with Monte Carlo dropout and learned aleatoric uncertainty will provide calibrated probabilistic forecasts superior to deterministic predictions, especially at longer lead times (14–30 days).

**Setup:**
- **Architecture:** Best physics-informed GNN from Experiment 2 with:
  - MC dropout (p=0.1) at inference for epistemic uncertainty
  - Heteroscedastic output layer predicting mean + variance for aleatoric uncertainty
  - 10-member ensemble with different graph initializations
- **Probabilistic outputs:** Predictive distribution for SIC, thickness at each node
- **Calibration:** Temperature scaling on validation set

**Baselines:**
- Deterministic GNN (best from Exp 2)
- IceNet ensemble [5] (current probabilistic benchmark)
- ECMWF extended-range ensemble forecast

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
- Reliability diagrams and calibration error
- Sharpness (ensemble spread)
- Brier Skill Score for binary ice/no-ice
- Rank histograms (ensemble consistency)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Ensemble GNN achieves 20–30% lower CRPS than deterministic model at 14+ day lead
- Calibration error < 0.05 after temperature scaling
- Uncertainty grows appropriately with lead time and in MIZ
- Probabilistic forecasts enable risk-based decision support (e.g., shipping route planning)

## 6. Stretch Ideas or Follow-Up Directions

1. **Multi-Region Transfer Learning:**  
   Train on Arctic, fine-tune and evaluate on Antarctic sea ice to test generalization across hemispheres with different ice dynamics and forcing regimes.

2. **Hybrid GNN–Numerical Model:**  
   Use GNN to learn residual corrections to CICE or neXtSIM numerical model outputs, combining physics-based simulation with data-driven refinement.

3. **Causal Graph Discovery:**  
   Apply causal inference techniques (e.g., Granger causality on graph edges) to identify dominant drivers of sea ice variability (atmospheric vs. oceanic forcing) in different regions/seasons.

4. **Super-Resolution Sea Ice Mapping:**  
   Extend GNN to downscale coarse-resolution model outputs (25 km) to high-resolution (4 km) using graph-based spatial interpolation informed by coastline geometry and bathymetry.

5. **Extreme Event Prediction:**  
   Focus on rare events (rapid ice loss, polynya formation) using imbalanced learning techniques and graph anomaly detection methods.

6. **Operational Deployment:**  
   Collaborate with national ice services (e.g., NSIDC, ECCC) to integrate GNN forecasts into operational sea ice prediction systems; develop API for real-time inference.

7. **Explainability and Feature Attribution:**  
   Use GNNExplainer or attention weight analysis to identify which spatial neighborhoods and input features drive predictions, providing insights into sea ice process understanding.
