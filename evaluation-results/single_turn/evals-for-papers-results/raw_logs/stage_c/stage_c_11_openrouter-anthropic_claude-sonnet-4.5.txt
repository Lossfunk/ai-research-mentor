Based on the retrieved evidence on climate model downscaling with uncertainty quantification [1,2,3], benchmark datasets [4,5], and Bayesian approaches [6,7], I can now construct a comprehensive cross-lab collaboration plan.

---

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Core Problem:**  
Global climate models (GCMs) from CMIP6 operate at coarse spatial resolutions (50–250 km), insufficient for regional impact assessments (agriculture, water resources, extreme events). Statistical and dynamical downscaling methods bridge this gap, but current approaches face critical limitations:

- **Uncertainty quantification:** Most deep learning downscaling methods produce point estimates without calibrated uncertainty [1,2]
- **Multi-model ensembles:** CMIP6 provides 30+ GCMs with divergent projections; combining them requires principled uncertainty aggregation [6,7]
- **Evaluation rigor:** No standardized benchmarks for comparing downscaling methods across regions, variables, and temporal scales [4,5]
- **Computational cost:** High-resolution dynamical downscaling (RCMs) is prohibitively expensive; statistical methods must balance speed and accuracy [1,3]
- **Physical consistency:** ML methods often violate conservation laws or produce unrealistic extremes [8]

**Key Gaps from Literature:**
- Limited cross-lab validation: Most studies evaluate on single regions or datasets [1,2,3]
- Uncertainty underestimation: Deep ensembles and Bayesian NNs often underestimate tail risks [2,6]
- Lack of operational benchmarks: No community-wide evaluation protocol like ImageNet for climate downscaling [4,5]
- Sparse collaboration: Climate science, ML, and uncertainty quantification communities work in silos

**Primary Goals (6-month cross-lab collaboration):**
1. **Develop unified benchmark suite** for downscaling evaluation across 5+ regions, 10+ variables, multiple GCMs
2. **Compare 8–10 uncertainty quantification methods** (Bayesian NNs, deep ensembles, diffusion models, quantile regression)
3. **Establish evaluation protocol** with physics-informed metrics, calibration diagnostics, and extreme event detection
4. **Enable multi-lab validation:** 3–5 partner labs independently reproduce results on shared infrastructure
5. **Release open-source toolkit** with pretrained models, evaluation scripts, and benchmark datasets

**Scientific Contributions:**
- First large-scale, multi-lab benchmark for climate downscaling with uncertainty quantification
- Empirical comparison of UQ methods on real-world climate data (not toy problems)
- Best practices for ensemble aggregation, calibration, and extreme event prediction
- Open-source infrastructure for reproducible climate ML research
- Policy-relevant insights: Which methods provide reliable uncertainty for adaptation planning?

**Cross-Lab Collaboration Structure:**
- **Lead lab (yours):** Coordination, benchmark design, primary experiments
- **Partner labs (3–5):** Independent validation, regional expertise, method contributions
- **Roles:** Climate scientists (domain expertise), ML researchers (methods), statisticians (UQ theory), HPC specialists (infrastructure)

## 2. Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Baseline Downscaling Methods Comparison**

**Hypothesis:**  
Deep learning methods (CNNs, U-Nets, diffusion models) will outperform traditional statistical downscaling (BCSD, MACA) on spatial resolution and extremes, but underestimate uncertainty without explicit UQ mechanisms.

**Setup:**
- **Downscaling methods (8 total):**
  - *Traditional:* BCSD (bias-corrected spatial disaggregation), MACA (multivariate adaptive constructed analogs)
  - *Deep learning:* U-Net [1], ResNet-based super-resolution, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - *Generative models:* Latent diffusion models [3,8], score-based diffusion
  - *Hybrid:* Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with hard constraints [8]
- **Input:** CMIP6 GCM outputs (daily temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity) at 100–250 km resolution
- **Target:** ERA5 reanalysis (0.25° ≈ 25 km) or high-resolution RCM outputs (CORDEX, 12 km)
- **Regions (5 diverse climates):**
  - North America (CONUS): Temperate, well-observed
  - Europe: High-quality RCM validation data (EURO-CORDEX)
  - South Asia: Monsoon dynamics, data-sparse

- Diffusion models best for extremes (99th percentile error 10–15% lower than U-Net)
- GANs produce realistic spatial patterns but overestimate extremes (mode collapse)
- PINNs maintain physical consistency but 5–10% higher RMSE than unconstrained models
- All methods underestimate uncertainty (coverage <80% for 90% prediction intervals)

### **Experiment 2: Uncertainty Quantification Methods Evaluation**

**Hypothesis:**  
Bayesian deep learning and deep ensembles will provide better-calibrated uncertainty than dropout or quantile regression, but at 5–10× computational cost. Diffusion models will naturally produce well-calibrated samples but struggle with tail events.

**Setup:**

  - *Generative models:* Diffusion models (sample 10–50 realizations) [1,3]
  - *Conformal prediction:* Distribution-free uncertainty quantification
- **Calibration protocol:**
  - Train on 1980–2000, validate on 2001–2010, test on 2011–2014
  - Compute prediction intervals (50%, 80%, 90%, 95%)
  - Measure calibration error, sharpness, coverage
- **Uncertainty decomposition:**
  - Aleatoric (irreducible, data noise)
  - Epistemic (model uncertainty, reducible with more data)
  - Scenario uncertainty (GCM spread, RCP/SSP pathways)

**Baselines:**
- Point estimates (no UQ)
- Gaussian assumption (mean ± 2σ from training residuals)
- GCM ensemble spread (raw CMIP6 multi-model range)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Calibration:**
  - Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
  - Reliability diagrams (predicted vs. observed coverage)
  - Sharpness (interval width)
- **Proper scoring rules:**

  - Extreme event detection (ROC-AUC, precision-recall)
- **Computational cost:**
  - Training time (GPU-hours)
  - Inference time (seconds per sample)
  - Memory overhead (GB)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Deep ensembles achieve best calibration (ECE <0.05) but 10× training cost
- Bayesian NNs (VI) underestimate uncertainty (coverage 70–80% for 90% intervals)
- MC Dropout fast but poorly calibrated (ECE 0.10–0.15)
- Diffusion models well-calibrated for typical events (ECE <0.08) but underestimate extremes
- Conformal prediction provides distribution-free guarantees but wide intervals (low sharpness)
- Identify optimal method: Deep ensembles for critical applications, MC Dropout for rapid prototyping

### **Experiment 3: Multi-Model Ensemble Aggregation**

**Hypothesis:**  
Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and stacking will outperform simple averaging of CMIP6 GCMs by 15–25% on CRPS, especially for precipitation and extremes, by accounting for model skill and inter-dependencies.

**Setup:**
- **CMIP6 models (10–15 selected):**
  - High-performing: CESM2, UKESM1, MPI-ESM, GFDL-CM4

  - *Weighted averaging:* Skill-based weights (historical performance)
  - *Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA):* Posterior model probabilities [6]
  - *Stacking:* Train meta-model (linear, random forest, neural network) on GCM outputs
  - *Hierarchical models:* Account for model genealogy (shared components)
- **Downscaling integration:**
  - Apply best UQ method from Experiment 2 to each GCM

**Expected Outcomes:**
- BMA reduces CRPS by 15–20% vs. simple averaging for precipitation, 10–15% for temperature
- Stacking with neural network meta-model achieves 20–25% improvement but risks overfitting
- Hierarchical models account for model genealogy, improve reliability (coverage 85–90%)
- Identify model dependencies: CESM2 and CESM2-WACCM highly correlated, should be downweighted
- Regional differences: BMA most valuable in data-sparse regions (Africa, South Asia)

## 6. Stretch Ideas or Follow-Up Directions

1. **Causal Downscaling:**  
   Use causal inference (do-calculus, structural causal models) to identify causal drivers of regional climate, improving interpretability and robustness to distribution shift.

2. **Foundation Models for Climate:**  
   Pretrain large-scale vision-language models on global climate data (ERA5, CMIP6), fine-tune for downscaling, forecasting, and impact assessment.

3. **Hybrid Dynamical-Statistical Downscaling:**  
   Combine RCM physics with ML emulators to achieve RCM accuracy at statistical downscaling speed (100× speedup).

4. **Extreme Event Attribution:**  
   Use downscaled projections to attribute specific events (2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, 2022 Pakistan floods) to climate change with uncertainty quantification.

5. **Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment:**  
   Integrate downscaled climate projections with impact models (crop, hydrology, health) to assess compound risks (drought + heatwave, flood + landslide).

6. **Real-Time Downscaling for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) Forecasting:**  
   Extend methods to operational forecasting (2 weeks to 2 months ahead), enabling early warning systems for agriculture, water, energy.

7. **Federated Learning for Climate Data:**  
   Enable multi-lab collaboration without sharing raw data (privacy-preserving), useful for proprietary or sensitive datasets.

8. **Explainable AI for Climate:**  
   Develop interpretability tools (saliency maps, concept activation vectors) to understand what downscaling models learn and build trust with stakeholders.

9. **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Design:**  
   Use downscaled projections with UQ to inform building codes, flood defenses, and urban planning under deep uncertainty.

10. **Global South Focus:**  
    Prioritize data-sparse regions (Africa, South Asia, Latin America) where downscaling has highest societal impact but lowest research investment.

**Optional next step:**  
Contact the authors of the ClimateNet benchmark [4] and RainShift dataset [5] to explore collaboration on extending their benchmarks to include uncertainty quantification metrics and multi-lab validation protocols. Also reach out to NCAR's Climate Data Gateway and Google's Earth Engine team to discuss data hosting and compute infrastructure for the cross-lab collaboration.
