For instance, for 'Anonymization scope,' the mitigation is to 'remove names, affiliations, acknowledgments, funding sources, and IRB protocol numbers.' For 'Privacy and safety,' the mitigation is to 'verify that prompts, transcripts, and screenshots omit PII and platform/user handles.' The 'Pre-submission anonymization checklist' also explicitly lists risks (e.g., 'Filenames' revealing identity) and their corresponding mitigations (e.g., 'Avoid names like OurLabStudy-v3.pdf; use generic names'). The 'Three concrete, falsifiable pre-submission “experiments” to validate compliance' section further reinforces this by outlining potential risks (e.g., 'author identity or institution' inference, 'PII or institutional identifiers' leakage) and providing methods to detect and mitigate them.",
