      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A directly addresses the user's prompt by analyzing the provided text excerpts and identifying specific risks and fixes. System B, on the other hand, states it cannot proceed without the paper and provides general information. System A's inquiry is more direct and actionable based on the given context.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: System A adapts well to the persona by acting as a reviewer checking a paper for specific compliance issues. It uses the provided text excerpts to ground its feedback. System B acknowledges the persona but cannot fulfill the task without the paper, resorting to general advice.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A critiques the paper's methodology by identifying potential data leakage and suggesting subgroup performance analyses. System B's critique is more general, discussing common violations in LLM compression papers.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a complete plan by listing specific risks, fixes, and even suggesting concrete experiments. System B's plan is incomplete as it requires the paper to proceed.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A provides relevant literature anchors (Model Cards, Energy and Policy Considerations) that are directly applicable to the identified risks. System B provides venue-specific checklists and templates, which are useful but less directly tied to the *content* of the paper's risks.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A offers highly actionable fixes and clearly outlines the risks associated with non-compliance. System B's action items are contingent on the user uploading the paper, and its risk assessment is general.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: System A adheres to the guidelines by providing specific, grounded feedback based on the provided text and avoiding overclaiming. System B, by not having the paper, cannot fully adhere to the task's specifics.\n\nSystem A is better because it directly addresses the user's prompt using the provided context, offering specific, actionable feedback and risk assessments. System B, while providing useful general information, fails to engage with the core task due to the lack of the paper.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A directly addresses the user's prompt by analyzing the provided text excerpts, identifying specific risks, and offering concrete fixes.
