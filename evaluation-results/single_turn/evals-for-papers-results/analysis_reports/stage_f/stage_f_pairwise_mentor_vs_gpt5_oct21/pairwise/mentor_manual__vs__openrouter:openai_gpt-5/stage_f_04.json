      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems ask clarifying questions to tailor their advice. System A asks for the target venue, while System B asks for the top 2-3 target venues. Both are good, but System B's request for multiple venues might lead to a more robust initial plan that can be refined later.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona of a researcher (stage F) who needs to map venue expectations and adapt their plan. They provide detailed, actionable advice. System A's plan is more explicitly tied to the user's specific paper title (\"Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?\"), which is a nice touch. System B's plan is more generalized but still highly relevant.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Neither system directly critiques the user's methodology, as the prompt was about mapping venue expectations and adapting a plan. They focus on *how* to present the methodology according to venue standards.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide comprehensive plans.\n    * System A breaks down the plan by venue groups (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR, ACL ARR/COLM, MLSys, TMLR) and then provides \"Practical deltas to bake into your checklist now.\" This is a good structure.\n    * System B provides a \"cross-venue plan\" that meets the strictest overlapping constraints, then details \"Manuscript structure,\" \"Anonymization,\" \"Reproducibility,\" \"Code/data release,\" \"Artifact badging,\" \"Submission packaging checklist,\" and a \"Timeline.\" It also includes \"Three concrete, falsifiable pre-submission experiments.\" This is arguably more comprehensive and actionable, especially the experimental suggestions.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant links to venue policies.\n    * System A provides a longer list of venues and links, organized by venue.\n    * System B also provides a good list, and importantly, it anchors its \"Adapted cross-venue plan\" with specific \"Literature/standards anchors\" like the NeurIPS Paper Checklist and ACM Artifact Badging criteria, which are very useful.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A's plan is actionable, with specific steps for different venue groups.\n    * System B's plan is highly actionable, with concrete suggestions for manuscript structure, anonymization, reproducibility, code/data release, and a detailed timeline. The \"Three concrete, falsifiable pre-submission experiments\" are particularly valuable for ensuring robustness and meeting artifact standards. It also explicitly mentions risks like \"non-determinism\" and \"clarity\" in its timeline.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems seem to adhere to guidelines. They provide information and avoid making definitive claims about future policies (e.g., \"confirm the current limit\").\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nSystem B is slightly better due to its more comprehensive and actionable \"cross-venue plan.\" The inclusion of specific, falsifiable pre-submission experiments is a significant advantage, as it provides concrete steps to ensure the artifact and reproducibility claims are robust. System B's structure, moving from general venue expectations to a unified plan and then to specific experiments, is also very logical. While System A's breakdown by venue groups is useful, System B's approach of identifying overlapping constraints and building a unified plan first is more efficient for a researcher facing multiple potential venues.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a more comprehensive and actionable plan by first identifying overlapping constraints across venues and then detailing concrete steps, including specific pre-submission experiments.
