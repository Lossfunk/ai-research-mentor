      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both A and B provide comprehensive lists of ethics/compliance sections. A is slightly better organized by grouping cross-venue requirements first, then venue-specific, then artifact practices. B is more directly venue-by-venue, which might be easier to digest for someone targeting a specific conference. Both are good.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both responses correctly identify the persona's domain (legal LLMs) and tailor the advice accordingly, highlighting specific legal-domain considerations like \"unauthorized legal advice,\" \"jurisdictional sensitivities,\" and \"court data.\" A's \"Notes specific to legal-domain LMs\" section is a strong point here. B integrates these legal-specific points throughout its venue-specific sections and also has a dedicated \"Law-specific additions\" section. Both are excellent.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: This aspect is not directly applicable as the user is asking for compliance requirements, not critiquing a methodology.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both provide comprehensive lists. A's structure (cross-venue, venue-specific, artifacts) is logical. B's venue-by-venue approach is also logical. A's inclusion of a \"concise compliance template\" at the end is a nice touch for actionability.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: A provides specific citations for each point, which is very helpful for verification and further reading. B mentions that it's basing guidance on \"standard policy patterns\" due to tool unavailability for 2025 pages, which is a good disclaimer but less helpful than A's direct links. A's citations are more comprehensive and directly linked to the points made.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both provide actionable lists. A's \"concise compliance template\" and B's \"Paper sections to draft now\" are both very actionable. A's explicit mention of \"red-teaming\" and \"deployment constraints\" under ethics is good. B's \"Law-specific additions\" are also highly actionable. A's inclusion of direct links to checklists makes it slightly more actionable for immediate reference.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both adhere well to the persona and task. A's use of citations is a strong point for grounding. B's disclaimer about tool unavailability is honest but reduces its grounding compared to A.\n\n**Overall Winner**: A is slightly better due to its more structured organization, comprehensive and directly linked citations, and the inclusion of a reusable compliance template.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more structured response, clearly separating cross-venue requirements from venue-specific ones. Its inclusion of direct citations for each point significantly enhances its utility and grounding, making it more actionable for the user. System B is also good but lacks the direct, comprehensive sourcing of A.\"\n}\n```",
