      "raw": "- **Inquiry Quality**: B is better because it asks more specific questions about the user's current progress and offers concrete next steps. A's questions are more general.\n- **Persona Adaptation**: Tie. Both systems adapt well to the persona's stage and domain.\n- **Methodology Critique**: A is better because it provides a more detailed critique of potential methodological issues, such as confounding shifts and the need for specific ablation studies. B's critique is more general.\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: A is better because its plan is more comprehensive, covering aspects like Model Cards, Datasheets, and artifact evaluation in detail. B's plan is good but less detailed in these areas.\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: A is better because it provides more relevant and recent literature anchors, including papers on domain generalization and MIL in pathology. B's literature guidance is relevant but less extensive.\n- **Actionability & Risks**: A is better because its \"Missing items to resolve now\" section is more actionable and specific, providing a clearer roadmap for the user. B's missing items are also good but less detailed.\n- **Guideline Adherence**: A is better because it more explicitly references and integrates research guidelines throughout its response, particularly regarding reproducibility and ethical considerations.\n\nOverall, System A provides a more thorough, actionable, and guideline-aligned response. It offers a deeper critique of the methodology and a more comprehensive plan for submission, making it the stronger choice for the user.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more comprehensive and actionable submission plan, including detailed checklists, experiments, and risk assessments.
