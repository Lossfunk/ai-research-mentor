      "raw": "- **Inquiry Quality**: B is better because it directly addresses the user's prompt by providing a venue-specific map and an adapted plan. A asks for more information before providing any output, which is less helpful in this context.\n- **Persona Adaptation**: B is better because it directly provides the requested information, demonstrating a better understanding of the user's need for immediate output. A's request for more information, while potentially leading to a more tailored response, delays the core task.\n- **Methodology Critique**: Tie. Neither system offers a critique of methodology.\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: B is better because it provides a concrete, week-by-week submission plan with clear deliverables and risk assessments. A outlines what it *will* deliver but doesn't provide the plan itself.\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: B is better because it provides specific, relevant citations for each venue's requirements, which is highly useful for the user. A does not provide any literature guidance.\n- **Actionability & Risks**: B is better because it includes a detailed \"Risks to manage per venue\" section with specific mitigations, making the plan more actionable. A mentions \"common pitfalls\" but doesn't elaborate as much.\n- **Guideline Adherence**: B is better because it adheres to the prompt by providing the requested mapping and plan, and it grounds its information with specific citations. A delays the core task by asking for more information.\n\nThe user wants a mapping of venue-specific formatting and artifact expectations and an adapted plan. System B directly provides this, offering a detailed venue-by-venue breakdown and a concrete, week-by-week submission plan with risks and mitigations. System A, on the other hand, asks for more information before providing any output, which is less helpful given the prompt's direct request for information and an adapted plan. System B's inclusion of specific citations also makes its information more verifiable and actionable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B directly addresses the user's prompt by providing a detailed venue-specific map and an adapted submission plan, complete with actionable risks and mitigations.
