      "raw": "- **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems provide excellent, detailed responses that directly address the user's prompt. They both propose a standardized communication protocol (SCP) and outline experimental designs, baselines, and statistical tests. System A's experimental design section is slightly more structured with distinct \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" that are well-defined. System B also offers concrete experiments but integrates them more closely with the statistical analysis details. Both are very strong here.\n- **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona, acknowledging the \"small_n\" constraint implicitly by focusing on rigorous analysis and power calculations. They both correctly identify the need to use the MST paper's methodology and baselines. System A's structure feels slightly more like a direct response to the user's request for an experiment design, while System B is also very good but perhaps a bit more conversational in its structure.\n- **Methodology Critique**: Both systems excel at critiquing methodology. They both suggest using the paper's LLM-as-a-Judge setup, discuss the importance of baselines, and propose relevant statistical tests. System A's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is particularly strong in framing specific hypotheses and falsifiable outcomes, which is a key aspect of rigorous methodology. System B also proposes strong experiments and ablations.\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide comprehensive plans. System A's ordering feels slightly more logical, starting with the overall goal, then the intervention, experimental design, concrete experiments, baselines, and statistical analysis. System B's structure is also good but interweaves some statistical details within the experimental designs. Both cover data, baselines, evaluation, and risks.\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems correctly identify the MST paper as the primary source and reference its appendix and methodology. System A explicitly mentions FIPA ACL [3] as an inspiration for its SCP design, which is a good addition. System B provides actual citations for statistical methods (Agresti, Benjamini & Hochberg), which is excellent.\n- **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems provide actionable next steps and implicitly address risks by suggesting controls, ablations, and careful statistical analysis. System A's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" are highly actionable. System B's \"Controls, ablations, and reproducibility\" section is also very strong in highlighting practical considerations and risks.\n- **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere well to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and ground their suggestions in the provided context (MST paper). System A's use of citations within the text is slightly more integrated with the explanation. System B's explicit \"What I still need\" section is a good way to manage uncertainty and guide the user.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a slightly more structured and direct experimental design, particularly with its \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section, which clearly outlines hypotheses and outcomes. Both systems are excellent, but System A's organization and clarity in presenting the experimental plan give it a slight edge. System B's inclusion of actual statistical method citations is a strong point, but System A's overall flow and detail in the experimental design are marginally superior.\n\n**Reasoning for Tie/A/B**:\n- **Inquiry Quality**: Tie. Both systems ask excellent, clarifying questions and propose well-scoped experiments.\n- **Persona Adaptation**: Tie. Both adapt well to the persona and constraints.\n- **Methodology Critique**: A. System A's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is particularly strong in framing hypotheses and falsifiable outcomes.\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: A. System A's ordering feels slightly more logical, starting with the overall goal and progressing through the intervention, design, experiments, baselines, and analysis.\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: B. System B provides actual citations for statistical methods, which is a valuable addition.\n- **Actionability & Risks**: Tie. Both provide actionable steps and address risks effectively through controls and ablations.\n- **Guideline Adherence**: Tie. Both adhere well to guidelines, avoiding overclaiming and grounding suggestions.\n\n**Final Decision**: System A is slightly better due to its superior structure and clarity in the experimental design section.```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more structured and actionable experimental design, particularly with its 'Concrete, falsifiable experiments' section.
