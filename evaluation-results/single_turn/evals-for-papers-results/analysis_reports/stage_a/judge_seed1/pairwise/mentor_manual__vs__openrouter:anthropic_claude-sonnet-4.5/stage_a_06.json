      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks a clarifying question at the end to tailor advice.\n    * System B: Asks a clarifying question at the end to tailor advice.\n    * Tie.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the persona's constraint (\"hate math\") and provides concrete, actionable advice tailored to this. It focuses on areas that are less math-intensive.\n    * System B: Also acknowledges the persona's constraint but frames it as a \"hard truth\" that math can't be *completely* avoided. It then breaks down options and the math involved in each, which is also helpful.\n    * System A is slightly better because it leans more into the \"yes, you can do it\" framing, which is more encouraging for someone with this aversion. System B's \"hard truth\" framing, while accurate, might be a bit discouraging.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Integrates methodological considerations (baselines, ablations, evaluation design, slice analysis, reproducibility) directly into its proposed plan and experiments. It references specific checklists and standards for rigor.\n    * System B: Mentions some methodological aspects like \"experimental design,\" \"ablation studies,\" and \"benchmarking & evaluation\" but doesn't integrate them as deeply into a structured plan or concrete experiments as System A.\n    * System A is better.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a detailed 8-10 week starter plan with clear steps and dependencies, followed by four concrete, falsifiable experiments. This is very comprehensive.\n    * System B: Offers a \"Practical learning path\" with phases and then \"Concrete next steps.\" This is less detailed and structured than System A's plan and experiments.\n    * System A is better.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Cites specific papers ([P1]-[P5]) with links, and integrates these citations throughout its advice and plan. The cited papers are directly relevant to the suggested research areas (data-centric AI, benchmarking, reporting standards, model cards, safety evaluation).\n    * System B: Mentions types of papers (dataset papers, application papers, empirical studies, evaluation papers) and suggests resources like Fast.ai, 3Blue1Brown, and StatQuest. It doesn't cite specific research papers in the same way System A does.\n    * System A is better for providing direct, actionable literature guidance relevant to the persona's goals.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Provides a very actionable 8-10 week plan and four concrete experiments. It implicitly addresses risks by focusing on rigorous evaluation and documentation, which are key to avoiding common pitfalls.\n    * System B: Offers actionable next steps (watch videos, take course, read papers) and suggests collaboration as a way to mitigate math-related risks.\n    * System A is better due to the highly detailed and structured plan and experiments.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines. It provides concrete advice, cites sources, and avoids overclaiming. The focus on empirical work aligns with the persona.\n    * System B: Also adheres well. It's honest about the math involved, provides options, and suggests learning paths.\n    * Tie.\n\n### **Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more structured, actionable, and research-focused response. Its 8-10 week plan and concrete experimental designs are highly valuable for someone looking to *do* AI research. It also integrates relevant literature citations more effectively to support its recommendations. While System B offers good general advice and learning resources, System A's depth and specificity make it superior for the task.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more structured, actionable, and research-focused response with a detailed plan and concrete experiments.
