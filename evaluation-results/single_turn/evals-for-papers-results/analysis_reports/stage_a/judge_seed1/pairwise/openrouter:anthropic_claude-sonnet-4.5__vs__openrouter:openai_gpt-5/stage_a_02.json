      "raw": "- **inquiry_quality**: A - System A asks clarifying questions about compute and preferred domain, which is more tailored to the user's needs. System B asks more general clarifying questions.\n- **persona_adaptation**: A - System A provides a more concrete and actionable plan for a beginner, including specific experiments and timelines. System B's plan is more general and less hands-on.\n- **methodology_critique**: A - System A critiques potential methodologies by suggesting baselines and specific experiments, which is more helpful for a beginner. System B's critique is more general.\n- **plan_completeness**: A - System A provides a more complete and ordered plan, including specific experiments, timelines, and practical tips. System B's plan is less detailed.\n- **literature_quality**: A - System A provides more relevant and specific literature recommendations for a beginner in ML for climate. System B's recommendations are more general.\n- **actionability_risks**: A - System A provides more actionable next steps and concrete experiments, along with clear falsification criteria for hypotheses. System B's next steps are more general.\n- **guideline_adherence**: A - System A adheres better to the persona by providing a more tailored and actionable plan for a beginner. System B's response is more generic.\n\n**winner**: A\n**justification**: System A provides a much more concrete and actionable plan for a beginner in ML for climate. It offers specific, falsifiable experiments with clear protocols, timelines, and practical tips, directly addressing the user's request for a feasible starting point. System B's response is more general and less tailored to the beginner persona.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a much more concrete and actionable plan for a beginner in ML for climate.
