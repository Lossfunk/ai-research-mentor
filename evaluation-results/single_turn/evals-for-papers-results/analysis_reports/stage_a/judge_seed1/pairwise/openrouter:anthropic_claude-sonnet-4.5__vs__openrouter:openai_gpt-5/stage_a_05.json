      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks no clarifying questions, but immediately provides a very specific, actionable plan.\n    * System B: Asks several clarifying questions upfront, which is good for tailoring, but delays providing concrete suggestions.\n    * **Tie**: System A is more proactive in providing a solution, while System B prioritizes understanding the user's context first.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Assumes the user has some ML background and resources (GPU/Colab) and immediately dives into a technical proposal. It does ask a quick check at the end.\n    * System B: Explicitly asks about the user's background, thesis type, and resources, demonstrating a better understanding of the persona's potential constraints and needs.\n    * **B**: System B is better at adapting to the persona by asking crucial clarifying questions before offering solutions.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Provides a detailed critique within its proposed experiments, discussing baselines, metrics, and falsification criteria.\n    * System B: Offers general categories of thesis topics but doesn't delve into specific methodological critiques for any of them.\n    * **A**: System A is superior in critiquing methodology by embedding it within its concrete research proposals.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Offers a complete, well-ordered 4-week plan for its primary recommendation, including setup, experiments, and deliverables. It also provides backup topics with brief plans.\n    * System B: Provides a high-level \"emergency strategy\" and then detailed time breakdowns for each of its suggested topic categories. Its \"default choice\" recommendation also has a concrete day-by-day plan.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems provide detailed, ordered plans, though System A's is more integrated into a single, specific research proposal, while System B offers more options with plans.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Cites two relevant papers with links, grounding its recommendations in existing work.\n    * System B: Suggests looking at specific conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and Papers with Code, which is good general guidance but less specific than A's citations.\n    * **A**: System A provides more direct and actionable literature guidance by citing specific, foundational papers relevant to its proposed topic.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Provides a very actionable plan with concrete experiments, deliverables, and a timeline. It implicitly addresses risks by keeping the scope small and suggesting controlled interventions.\n    * System B: Offers actionable advice on immediate steps and \"red flags to avoid.\" Its suggested topics are framed as \"safe\" and \"low-risk.\"\n    * **Tie**: Both are highly actionable. System A is actionable in *doing* the research, while System B is actionable in *choosing* and *starting* the research.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines by providing a scoped, defensible plan and citing sources. It avoids overclaiming.\n    * System B: Adheres well by offering safe, feasible options and warning against overly ambitious projects. It also avoids overclaiming.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems follow the implicit guidelines of providing helpful, realistic advice for a student under a deadline.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a much more concrete, technically detailed, and immediately actionable research plan. While System B asks good clarifying questions, System A's direct proposal, complete with specific experiments, metrics, and a timeline, is more valuable for a student facing an urgent deadline. System A's inclusion of falsifiable hypotheses and specific literature citations further strengthens its response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"Tie\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a highly specific, technically detailed, and actionable research plan with concrete experiments and literature citations, making it more immediately useful for a student under a tight deadline. System B's approach of asking many clarifying questions first, while valid, delays the delivery of a concrete solution.\"\n}\n```",
