      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems ask clarifying questions to tailor their advice. System A asks about compute access and advisor preference, while System B asks about compute access and preferred archetype. Both are good, but System A's question about advisor preference is slightly more insightful for a student thesis.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the student persona and the deadline constraint. They both offer tightly scoped, feasible projects. System A's focus on a single, detailed topic with clear experiments and a plan feels more tailored to a student who needs a concrete starting point. System B offers more archetypes, which might be overwhelming.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A provides a very detailed critique within its recommended topic, discussing baselines, metrics, and potential falsifications for each experiment. System B also discusses baselines, metrics, and experiments across its archetypes, but it's less deeply integrated into a single proposal.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a very clear, week-by-week plan for its recommended topic, including deliverables and practical tips. System B also provides a 4-week plan, but it's more generic across its archetypes. System A's plan feels more actionable for a student starting from scratch.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A cites two highly relevant papers directly related to its recommended topic. System B cites two papers that are more general guides to LLM research and benchmarking, which are useful but less directly tied to specific project ideas.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A is highly actionable, providing a specific topic, experiments, and a plan. It also implicitly addresses risks by suggesting controlled experiments and clear falsification criteria. System B is also actionable by providing archetypes and plans, but the breadth of options might make it less immediately actionable than System A's focused recommendation.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to guidelines. System A's citations are directly relevant to its proposed experiments, while System B's citations are more general.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A.\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more concrete, actionable, and deeply thought-out thesis proposal tailored to the user's constraints. Its recommended topic is well-defined with clear experiments, a detailed plan, and relevant literature, making it easier for a student to adopt and execute within the given timeframe. System B offers more options but is less specific, potentially overwhelming the user.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more concrete, actionable, and deeply thought-out thesis proposal tailored to the user's constraints.
