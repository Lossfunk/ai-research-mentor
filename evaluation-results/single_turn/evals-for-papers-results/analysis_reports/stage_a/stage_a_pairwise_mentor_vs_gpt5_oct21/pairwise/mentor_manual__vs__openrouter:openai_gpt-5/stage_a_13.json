      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems ask clarifying questions at the end, but System A's initial response is more structured and directly addresses the user's constraint. System B's initial response is good but less focused on the \"no datasets\" constraint.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the \"public_health_advocate\" persona by suggesting relevant datasets and research areas. System A's focus on privacy and fairness aligns well with public health advocacy. System B also touches on these but is slightly more general.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A provides concrete, falsifiable project ideas with specific hypotheses, setups, and metrics, demonstrating a strong understanding of experimental design. System B also offers concrete experiments but they are slightly less detailed in their initial framing.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide a 4-week plan. System A's plan is more detailed and actionable, breaking down tasks week by week. System B's plan is also good but slightly less granular.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A provides a good mix of dataset citations and relevant survey papers. System B also provides good citations, but some of its \"P\" citations are less directly tied to the immediate suggestions.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A's project ideas are highly actionable, with clear steps and metrics. It also implicitly addresses risks by focusing on privacy-preserving methods. System B also provides actionable steps and mentions risks like heterogeneity in FL.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to guidelines. System A's citations are well-integrated into the text and its claims are well-supported. System B also does this well.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A is slightly better because its project ideas are more concrete and actionable, with clearer hypotheses and experimental setups. Its 4-week plan is also more detailed, providing a more direct roadmap for the user. Both systems provide excellent resources and adapt well to the persona.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides more concrete and actionable project ideas with clearer hypotheses and experimental setups, along with a more detailed 4-week plan.
