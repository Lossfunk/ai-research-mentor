      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A asks specific, actionable questions about the user's idea, focusing on the experimental design and potential pitfalls.\n    * System B asks broader, more general questions about the user's idea, which are necessary for understanding the scope but less immediately actionable for experimental design.\n    * **A is better** because it moves towards concrete experimental design, which is more aligned with the persona of a research mentor guiding a student.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A adopts the persona of a knowledgeable mentor, providing a structured overview of the field, potential pitfalls, and concrete experimental designs. It directly addresses the user's \"idea\" with a plan.\n    * System B also adopts a helpful persona but is more focused on gathering information before providing guidance. It correctly identifies the broadness of the user's prompt.\n    * **A is better** because it provides a more comprehensive and proactive response, offering a framework for experimentation rather than just asking for more information.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A explicitly discusses key methodological considerations like data leakage, baselines, ablations, and evaluation metrics, providing domain-specific examples.\n    * System B touches on these indirectly by asking about the \"gap\" and \"unique angle,\" but doesn't offer the same level of detail or critique.\n    * **A is better** as it directly addresses and critiques potential methodological flaws.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A provides a complete plan, including literature guidance, concrete experiments, and practical next steps, all logically ordered.\n    * System B's plan is more about information gathering before a plan can be formed. It outlines what *it* needs to know and what the *user* should do.\n    * **A is better** because it delivers a more complete and actionable plan upfront.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A provides specific, recent citations ([P1]-[P3], [P8]-[P10]) that are directly relevant to the discussed topics (genomics, proteins, multi-omics transformers).\n    * System B mentions specific models (ESM, ProtBERT, AlphaFold2, DNABERT, etc.) but doesn't provide citations or guidance on where to find more information.\n    * **A is better** due to its specific, cited, and relevant literature references.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A offers three concrete, falsifiable experiments and practical next steps, clearly outlining what the user can do. It also implicitly highlights risks through its \"Key pitfalls\" section.\n    * System B asks for more information before it can offer concrete next steps or identify specific risks. Its \"Quick Viability Framework\" is helpful but less actionable than A's experimental designs.\n    * **A is better** because it provides immediate, actionable steps and experimental designs.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A adheres well to guidelines by providing evidence-based information, citing sources, and avoiding overclaiming. It frames its suggestions as experiments.\n    * System B also adheres well, correctly identifying the broadness of the prompt and asking clarifying questions.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems follow the guidelines well.\n\n**Overall Winner**: A\n\n**Justification**: System A is superior because it adopts a more proactive and guiding persona, directly addressing the user's idea with a comprehensive plan that includes concrete experimental designs, methodological critiques, and relevant literature. System B, while also helpful, is more focused on information gathering and less immediately actionable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A is superior because it adopts a more proactive and guiding persona, directly addressing the user's idea with a comprehensive plan that includes concrete experimental designs, methodological critiques, and relevant literature.
