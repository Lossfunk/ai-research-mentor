      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions about the user's timeline, context, and motivations. This helps tailor the advice.\n    * System B: Does not ask clarifying questions. It provides a general plan.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Acknowledges the user's \"never coded\" constraint and provides a plan that accounts for this, suggesting learning timelines and leveraging existing code. It also addresses the \"stage B\" by offering concrete experiments.\n    * System B: Also acknowledges the \"never coded\" constraint and provides a detailed learning plan. However, it doesn't explicitly address the \"stage B\" or offer concrete experiments.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques the feasibility by suggesting a narrow scope, specific data sources, baselines (persistence, climatology, CNN/U-Net), and a first graph model (spatiotemporal GNN). It also proposes concrete, falsifiable experiments with clear pass/fail criteria.\n    * System B: Focuses more on the learning requirements and doesn't delve into specific methodological critiques or experimental designs.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a structured learning and build plan with weekly breakdowns, covering data, baselines, graph setup, and evaluation. It also includes alternative paths (collaboration, reproducibility) and concrete experiments.\n    * System B: Offers two distinct paths (learn first, collaborate now) with detailed timelines for learning. It also suggests a hybrid approach and concrete first steps.\n    * **Winner: Tie** (Both provide comprehensive plans, but System A's plan is more integrated with the research task itself, while System B's is more focused on the learning journey.)\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides two relevant citations for graph nets in sea ice prediction, which are directly applicable to the user's query.\n    * System B: Mentions general resources like Fast.ai, Coursera, Stanford CS224W, and PyTorch Geometric tutorials, but doesn't provide specific literature related to the sea ice domain or graph nets for it.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers concrete next steps (implementing baselines, setting up graph models, running experiments) and explicitly lists risks (data wrangling, overfitting, compute creep) with de-risking strategies.\n    * System B: Provides actionable first steps for both solo and collaborative paths, and lists \"Red Flags\" and \"Green Flags\" for success, which serve a similar purpose to risk identification.\n    * **Winner: A** (System A's risks are more directly tied to the proposed research plan, making them slightly more actionable in that context.)\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres to guidelines by being specific, actionable, and avoiding overclaiming. It grounds its advice in concrete steps and realistic timelines.\n    * System B: Also adheres to guidelines by being realistic and structured.\n    * **Winner: Tie**\n\n### Final Winner: A\n\n**Justification:** System A is superior because it directly addresses the user's research question with a concrete, actionable plan that includes specific methodological suggestions, baselines, and falsifiable experiments. It also provides relevant literature and clearly outlines risks tied to the proposed research. System B offers a good learning plan but is less specific about the research itself.",
