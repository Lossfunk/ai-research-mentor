      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions about the novelty and potential for impact, guiding the user towards a more specific and researchable problem.\n    * System B: Directly addresses the user's prompt by stating the idea is not novel and then provides a structured breakdown of why, along with concrete alternative research directions.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems engage with the user's prompt effectively, though System B is more direct in its critique and offers a broader range of alternative research areas.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Acknowledges the ambitious vision but immediately grounds it in current research and practical limitations, suggesting a path to novelty within that vision.\n    * System B: Directly confronts the \"ambitious vision\" by calling it a \"reality check\" and explaining why AGI for world hunger isn't a research project. It then pivots to more grounded, specific research directions.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems adapt well. System A tries to steer the user's existing vision towards novelty, while System B challenges the vision itself and offers alternative paths.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques the user's implicit methodology by highlighting the lack of novelty and suggesting specific, falsifiable tests with baselines and metrics. It focuses on *how* to make the user's idea novel.\n    * System B: Critiques the user's framing by pointing out that AGI is not a research project and world hunger is not primarily a technical problem. It critiques the *premise* of the user's idea.\n    * **Tie**: Both offer critiques, but from different angles. System A critiques the *research methodology* implied by the user's goal, while System B critiques the *fundamental assumptions* behind the goal.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a detailed plan for how to achieve novelty within the user's ambitious goal, including specific research directions, tests, and data considerations.\n    * System B: Offers a broader set of potential research directions, critiques the user's current framing, and provides advice on how to reframe the question. It doesn't lay out a single plan but offers multiple starting points.\n    * **Tie**: System A offers a more integrated plan for the user's *stated* goal, while System B offers a more comprehensive critique and a menu of alternative plans.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides specific citations that directly support its claims about current AI applications in food security and potential areas of novelty. The citations are relevant and appear to be recent.\n    * System B: Provides fewer citations, focusing on the conceptual issues (AGI definition, root causes of hunger). The citations are relevant to the points they support.\n    * **Tie**: Both provide relevant citations. System A's citations are more directly tied to the technical research directions it suggests, while System B's are more about the broader context.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers very concrete, actionable research tests (E1-E5) with falsifiable criteria, directly addressing how to make progress and what constitutes success or failure. It implicitly highlights the risk of not achieving these criteria.\n    * System B: Offers actionable advice on reframing the question and suggests concrete research directions (A-D). It explicitly calls out risks like AGI not being a research project and hunger not being purely technical.\n    * **Tie**: Both are highly actionable. System A's actionability is focused on *testing* the user's idea for novelty, while System B's is focused on *reframing* the idea into something actionable.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines. It avoids overclaiming, grounds its advice in existing work, and uses citations appropriately. It directly addresses the novelty question.\n    * System B: Adheres well to guidelines. It is direct but constructive, avoids overclaiming, and uses citations to support its points. It also directly addresses the novelty question.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems follow the guidelines effectively.\n\n### Winner: Tie\n\nSystem A provides a more direct path to making the user's *existing* ambitious vision novel by detailing specific research tests and metrics. System B offers a more fundamental critique of the user's premise and provides a broader menu of alternative, more tractable research directions. Both are excellent responses that adapt to the persona and task, but they take slightly different, equally valid approaches. System A's detailed falsifiable tests are particularly strong for a researcher at stage B looking to define novelty. System B's broader critique and alternative directions are also valuable for grounding the user.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie",
