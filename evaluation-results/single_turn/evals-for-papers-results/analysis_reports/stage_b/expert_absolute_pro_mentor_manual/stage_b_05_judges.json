This is a strong reinforcement of progress.\n4.  **Offering 'Recommendations and next steps':** Practical advice on how to proceed.\n5.  **Including 'Literature anchors' and 'Citations':** This provides valuable resources for further exploration.\n\nThe tone throughout is encouraging and supportive, focusing on how the user *can* achieve their goal with a refined approach, rather than dismissing their initial idea.
