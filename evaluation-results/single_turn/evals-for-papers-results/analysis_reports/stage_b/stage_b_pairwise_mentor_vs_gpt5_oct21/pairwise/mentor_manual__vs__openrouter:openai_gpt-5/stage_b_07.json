      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems directly address the user's question about novelty and saturation. System A is slightly more specific in its initial assessment by mentioning CNN detectors and YOLO variants as current deployed methods, which provides a clearer contrast to ViTs. System B mentions \"strong prior work in aerial image detection and density-based counting\" which is also relevant but less directly tied to the \"low-cost vision transformers\" aspect of the prompt.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona of a researcher in wildlife monitoring looking for novel research directions. They both suggest concrete experiments and highlight practical considerations like edge deployment, cost, and ecological relevance. System A's structure, with \"Where the field looks crowded\" and \"Where novelty likely remains,\" is very effective for this persona.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A provides more detailed and specific critiques within its proposed experiments. For example, in experiment 1, it explicitly lists metrics like \"mAP for detection, MAE/RMSE for per-image counts, FPS, energy per image (J), energy–delay product, peak memory, model size,\" and defines falsifiable outcomes clearly. System B also suggests metrics but is generally less detailed in the experimental setups.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems offer a good set of concrete, falsifiable experiments. System A's experiments are slightly more fleshed out and cover a broader range of relevant sub-topics (edge deployment, long-tail/domain shift, sequence-aware counting). System B's experiments are also good but perhaps slightly less comprehensive in their initial framing. System A's \"Minimum baselines and reporting for a convincing 'low-cost ViT' paper\" section is a very valuable addition for completeness.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant citations. System A's citations seem slightly more directly aligned with the core aspects of the prompt (MegaDetector, camera trap ML survey, long-tailed metrics, YOLOv5s in wildlife, etc.). System B's citations are also relevant, but some (like [1] \"Ensembles of data-efficient vision transformers as a new paradigm for image classification\") are more general ViT papers rather than specific to wildlife monitoring applications.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems provide actionable next steps in the form of concrete experiments. System A's \"Bottom line\" and \"Key takeaways\" sections offer a very clear summary of the novelty and the conditions under which it would be recognized. System B's \"Bottom line\" is also good but slightly less direct. Neither system explicitly details risks and mitigations, but the falsifiable nature of the experiments implicitly addresses this.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere well to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and present their suggestions as research directions. Both use citations appropriately.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A.\n\nSystem A is slightly better due to its more detailed experimental designs, clearer articulation of where novelty lies versus where the field is crowded, and a more comprehensive \"minimum baselines and reporting\" section. Its citations also feel more tightly focused on the specific domain and problem.```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides more detailed and specific experimental designs, clearly delineates crowded vs. novel areas, and offers a more comprehensive section on essential baselines and reporting.
