      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems directly address the user's question about novelty and pitfalls in generative models for indigenous language revitalization. They both provide structured answers with clear sections for novelty and pitfalls. System A's novelty points are slightly more concrete and tied to specific applications (augmentation, ASR/TTS, etc.), while System B's are more conceptual (alignment signals, morphology-aware generation). Both are good, but System A feels a bit more grounded in practical applications.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems acknowledge the \"sensitive_domain\" and \"language_revival\" aspects. They both emphasize community governance, data sovereignty, and cultural safety. System A's references to specific protocols like CARE and OCAP, and real-world cases like Te Hiku Media, make it feel more tailored to the specific nuances of this domain. System B also mentions these concepts but less explicitly.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A offers more detailed critiques within its \"Key pitfalls to note\" and \"At least three concrete, falsifiable experiments\" sections. For example, it critiques \"Evaluation mismatch\" by mentioning specific metrics that are missed and suggesting human/community evaluation. System B also critiques evaluation mismatch but is less detailed. System A's experimental designs are also more fleshed out with specific metrics and falsifiable outcomes.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide a good structure, starting with a short answer, then detailing novelty, pitfalls, experiments, and practical steps. System A's \"At least three concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is more comprehensive, including setup, metrics, and falsifiable outcomes for each. System B's experiments are also good but slightly less detailed in their descriptions. System A also includes a \"Practical steps to reduce risk\" section which is very actionable.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant citations. System A's citations are more diverse, including specific protocols (CARE, OCAP), case studies (Te Hiku Media, Papa Reo), and academic papers. System B's citations are more concentrated on a few papers, some of which are repeated. System A's references feel more comprehensive and directly supportive of the points made.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"Practical steps to reduce risk\" section is highly actionable and directly addresses the identified pitfalls. It provides concrete advice like forming an advisory board, maintaining a data catalog, and using safety rails. System B also provides practical next steps, but they are slightly less detailed and actionable than System A's. Both systems clearly identify risks.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and present information responsibly. System A's use of specific, verifiable examples and protocols strengthens its adherence.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more comprehensive and actionable response. Its novelty points are more concrete, its critique of methodologies is more detailed, and its proposed experiments are better defined with falsifiable outcomes. Furthermore, its \"Practical steps to reduce risk\" section offers more specific and actionable guidance, and its literature references are more diverse and directly supportive of the claims made.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more comprehensive and actionable response, with more concrete novelty points, detailed methodological critiques, and better-defined experimental designs.
