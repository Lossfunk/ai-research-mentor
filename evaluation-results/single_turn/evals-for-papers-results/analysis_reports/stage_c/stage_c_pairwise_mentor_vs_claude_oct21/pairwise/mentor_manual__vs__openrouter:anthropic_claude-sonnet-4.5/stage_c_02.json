      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality:**\n    * System A: The questions are well-scoped and directly address the user's prompt. They are specific and actionable, leading to concrete experiments.\n    * System B: The questions are also good, but slightly less focused on the \"how-to\" of the experiments and more on the \"what\" and \"why.\" The goals are broader.\n    * **Winner: A** (A's questions are more directly tied to planning concrete experiments and ablations.)\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation:**\n    * System A: Adheres well to the persona's stage (C), domain (compressible LLMs), and duration (6 months). The plan is detailed and realistic for this stage.\n    * System B: Also adapts well, but the scope feels a bit too ambitious for a 6-month project at stage C, especially with \"compression-aware pretraining from scratch\" and \"joint optimization of compression techniques\" as major experiments.\n    * **Winner: A** (A's plan is more grounded in the persona's constraints.)\n\n3. **Methodology Critique:**\n    * System A: Critiques are embedded within the experiment descriptions (e.g., comparing PTQ vs. QAT, calibration data impact). It explicitly mentions baselines, metrics, and expected outcomes.\n    * System B: Also includes critiques within experiments, but some are more high-level (e.g., \"sequential application... often operate in isolation\"). It also lists baselines and metrics.\n    * **Winner: A** (A's critique is more detailed and integrated into the experimental design.)\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n    * System A: The plan is comprehensive, covering problem framing, experiments, timeline, resources, risks, and stretch ideas. The ordering of experiments seems logical, building from baselines to more complex methods.\n    * System B: Also comprehensive, but the ordering feels slightly less optimized. Experiment 3 (pretraining from scratch) might be too resource-intensive and time-consuming to fit well early in a 6-month plan, especially when Experiment 2 aims for joint optimization.\n    * **Winner: A** (A's ordering is more practical for a 6-month timeline.)\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality:**\n    * System A: Integrates literature citations ([P#]) directly into the problem framing and experiment descriptions, showing how specific papers inform the proposed work. The \"Literature anchors\" section summarizes key references.\n    * System B: Uses numbered citations [1,2,3...] which are listed at the end. While relevant, the integration is less direct, and the \"Sources\" section is a simple list without much explanation of *why* each source is relevant to specific parts of the plan.\n    * **Winner: A** (A's integration of literature is more effective and informative.)\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks:**\n    * System A: Provides concrete next steps (\"Greenlight Exp.1+Exp.3 on a single 7B model this week\"). The risks section is well-defined with clear mitigations.\n    * System B: Also provides an \"Optional next step\" and a detailed \"Risks and Mitigations Table.\" Both are good, but A's immediate next step feels more actionable.\n    * **Winner: A** (A's immediate next step is more concrete, and the risks/mitigations are presented clearly.)\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence:**\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines. It avoids overclaiming and is transparent about limitations. The citations are well-integrated.\n    * System B: Also adheres well, but some of the goals (e.g., \"8–12× compression while retaining >90% of original model performance\") might be considered ambitious and bordering on overclaiming for a 6-month project at stage C, especially without extensive pre-existing infrastructure.\n    * **Winner: A** (A is more conservative and realistic in its claims, aligning better with guideline adherence.)\n\n### **Final Winner Justification**\n\nSystem A is better because it provides a more concrete, actionable, and realistically scoped plan for the given persona and timeframe. Its integration of literature is more effective, and its experimental design is ordered logically, starting with baselines and building towards more complex methods. System B's plan, while comprehensive, is overly ambitious for a 6-month project at stage C, particularly its pretraining-from-scratch experiment, and its literature integration is less impactful.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"",
