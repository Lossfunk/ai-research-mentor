      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality:**\n    * **System A:** Asks targeted questions about specific aspects of the plan, such as the choice of languages, tasks, and evaluation metrics. The questions are well-scoped and relevant to the user's prompt.\n    * **System B:** Does not ask any questions. It directly provides a comprehensive plan.\n    * **Winner:** A (due to asking relevant questions)\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation:**\n    * **System A:** Acknowledges the \"limited compute\" constraint by suggesting quantized models and efficient serving. It also implicitly addresses the \"multilingual fact-checking\" domain by focusing on relevant tasks and languages.\n    * **System B:** Explicitly addresses the \"limited compute\" constraint throughout the plan, detailing GPU requirements, model sizes, and quantization strategies. It also thoroughly covers the \"multilingual fact-checking\" domain with relevant datasets, models, and tasks.\n    * **Winner:** B (more explicit and comprehensive adaptation to persona constraints)\n\n3. **Methodology Critique:**\n    * **System A:** Critiques the methodology by suggesting sanity checks that address potential issues like label mapping consistency, RAG improvements correlation, refusal rates, and translation artifacts.\n    * **System B:** Critiques the methodology by identifying \"Key Gaps from Literature\" such as benchmark fragmentation, resource constraints, language imbalance, task diversity, and evaluation gaps. It also includes a detailed \"Sanity Checks and Failure Analysis\" section.\n    * **Winner:** B (more structured and detailed critique)\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n    * **System A:** Provides a well-structured plan with clear sections for problem framing, experiments, timeline, resources, risks, and stretch ideas. The experiments are logically ordered and build upon each other.\n    * **System B:** Offers an extremely comprehensive plan, covering all aspects requested in the prompt and more. The ordering of experiments is logical, and the timeline is detailed.\n    * **Winner:** B (more comprehensive and detailed plan)\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality:**\n    * **System A:** Cites relevant papers ([P1]-[P6]) and integrates them into the plan, explaining how they inform specific design choices. The citations are well-placed and relevant.\n    * **System B:** Cites a broader range of literature ([1]-[10]) and uses them to frame the problem, identify gaps, and justify the proposed experiments. The citations are comprehensive and well-integrated.\n    * **Winner:** B (broader and more integrated use of literature)\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks:**\n    * **System A:** Clearly outlines risks and mitigations in a dedicated section. The \"Optional next step\" provides a concrete action item.\n    * **System B:** Provides a very detailed \"Risks and Mitigations Table\" and a \"Concrete Action Plan (First Month)\" with weekly breakdowns, making it highly actionable.\n    * **Winner:** B (more actionable and detailed risk/action planning)\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence:**\n    * **System A:** Adheres to guidelines by focusing on the prompt, avoiding overclaiming, and grounding suggestions in the provided persona.\n    * **System B:** Adheres to guidelines by providing a thorough and grounded plan, explicitly addressing constraints, and avoiding speculative claims.\n    * **Winner:** Tie\n\n### **Overall Winner:** B\n\n**Justification:** System B provides a significantly more comprehensive, detailed, and actionable plan. It excels in adapting to the persona's constraints, offering a deeper critique of existing methodologies, and structuring the plan with extensive detail in experiments, resources, risks, and a concrete timeline. While System A is good, System B's depth and breadth make it the superior response.",
