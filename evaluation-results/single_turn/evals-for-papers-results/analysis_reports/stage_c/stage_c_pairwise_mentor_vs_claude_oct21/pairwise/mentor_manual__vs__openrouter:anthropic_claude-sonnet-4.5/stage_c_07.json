      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality:**\n    * System A: Asks targeted questions about specific experimental setups and expected outcomes.\n    * System B: Asks broader questions about the overall plan and potential collaborations.\n    * **Tie.** Both systems ask relevant questions, but System A's are more focused on the technical details of the experiments, which is appropriate for this stage.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation:**\n    * System A: Directly addresses the persona's constraints (low-power, volunteer divers, 6-month duration) and domain (coral_cv). The plan is detailed and realistic for the given constraints.\n    * System B: Also addresses the persona's constraints and domain, but the goals are more ambitious (e.g., <500 mW inference, 85% agreement with experts) and the timeline might be tight for achieving all of them.\n    * **A** is better because it provides a more grounded and feasible plan within the specified constraints.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique:**\n    * System A: Critiques potential methodologies by proposing specific experiments, baselines, and metrics. It also considers trade-offs (e.g., energy-accuracy).\n    * System B: Proposes experiments and metrics but doesn't engage in as much critique of potential methodologies. It focuses more on presenting its own proposed methods.\n    * **A** is better for its more critical and comparative approach to methodology.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n    * System A: Provides a comprehensive 6-month plan with clear experiments, timelines, resources, risks, and stretch goals. The ordering of experiments seems logical.\n    * System B: Also provides a comprehensive plan with experiments, timeline, resources, and risks. The ordering is also logical.\n    * **Tie.** Both plans are well-structured and cover all necessary aspects.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality:**\n    * System A: Integrates citations throughout the plan, referencing specific papers and protocols relevant to the task. The citations are well-placed and support the proposed methods.\n    * System B: Also integrates citations, but some of them appear to be fabricated or misattributed (e.g., [1] \"A Comparative Study of YOLOv8 to YOLOv11 Performance in Underwater Vision Tasks\" and [2] \"From underwater to aerial: a novel multi-scale knowledge distillation approach for coral reef monitoring\" are likely generated).\n    * **A** is significantly better due to its accurate and relevant use of citations, avoiding the hallucinated references in System B.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks:**\n    * System A: Clearly outlines actionable steps within the timeline and provides a detailed risk assessment with specific mitigations.\n    * System B: Also outlines actionable steps and risks with mitigations, but some of the risks are less specific or the mitigations are less concrete.\n    * **A** is better due to its more concrete and actionable risk mitigation strategies.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence:**\n    * System A: Adheres well to the guidelines, providing a detailed and well-supported plan without overclaiming. The citations are verifiable.\n    * System B: Fails to adhere to the guideline of avoiding hallucinated citations, which is a major issue.\n    * **A** is better for its adherence to the citation guidelines and overall accuracy.\n\n### **Final Winner:** A\n\n**Justification:** System A provides a more grounded, feasible, and methodologically sound plan that directly addresses the persona's constraints. Crucially, System A avoids the hallucinated citations present in System B, making its guidance reliable and trustworthy. System A's risk mitigation strategies are also more concrete and actionable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more feasible and grounded plan, with concrete experimental details and realistic timelines.
