      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks specific, falsifiable hypotheses with clear acceptance criteria. This demonstrates a strong understanding of experimental design.\n    * System B: Poses hypotheses that are more general statements of expected outcomes rather than falsifiable claims.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the 6-month timeline and the domain of compressible LLMs. It structures the plan around experiments and ablations, which is appropriate for a research plan.\n    * System B: Also addresses the 6-month timeline and the domain. It provides a comprehensive list of experiments and resources.\n    * **Tie**\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques methodology by proposing specific ablations (e.g., bit-width, group size, calibration set size) and clearly states hypotheses with acceptance criteria.\n    * System B: Proposes experiments and ablations but lacks the same level of detail in defining falsifiable hypotheses or specific acceptance criteria for each experiment.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a well-structured plan with clear experimental phases, timelines, and deliverables. The ordering of experiments seems logical, building upon previous ones.\n    * System B: Also provides a comprehensive plan with experiments, timelines, and resources. The ordering is reasonable, though some experiments could be more tightly integrated.\n    * **Tie**\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Integrates literature anchors directly into the experimental descriptions and hypotheses, showing how the proposed work builds on existing research.\n    * System B: Lists literature anchors separately and also integrates them into experiment descriptions. Both systems do a good job of citing relevant work.\n    * **Tie**\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly outlines risks and provides specific mitigations. The deliverables are also well-defined.\n    * System B: Also outlines risks and mitigations effectively. The \"Optional next step\" is a good actionable item.\n    * **Tie**\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres to guidelines by providing a structured plan, citing literature, and avoiding overclaiming.\n    * System B: Also adheres to guidelines, providing a detailed plan with citations and risk assessments.\n    * **Tie**\n\n### Winner: A\nSystem A is better because its inquiry quality is superior, with clearly defined, falsifiable hypotheses and acceptance criteria for each experiment. This level of detail in experimental design is crucial for a research plan. While both systems provide comprehensive plans, System A's focus on falsifiability makes its proposed experiments more rigorous and actionable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"Tie\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A excels in inquiry quality by proposing clearly falsifiable hypotheses with specific acceptance criteria, demonstrating a more rigorous experimental design.
