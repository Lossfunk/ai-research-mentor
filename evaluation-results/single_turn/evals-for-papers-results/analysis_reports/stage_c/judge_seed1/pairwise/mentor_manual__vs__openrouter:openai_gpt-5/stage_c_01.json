      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks very specific, detailed questions about the research plan, covering problem framing, data, models, baselines, evaluation, and timeline. It breaks down the plan into logical sections and experiments.\n    * System B: Asks more general questions about the research plan, focusing on scope, objectives, data, models, and evaluation. It's less detailed than System A.\n    * **Winner: A** (System A's questions are more comprehensive and detailed, guiding the user towards a more robust research plan.)\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the persona's domain (sea ice) and stage (C, implying a need for a detailed plan). It uses appropriate terminology and suggests relevant datasets and tools.\n    * System B: Also addresses the persona's domain and stage. It uses relevant terminology and suggests appropriate datasets and tools.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems adapt well to the persona.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques the proposed methodology by suggesting specific baselines (CNN/Transformer, persistence, climatology, optical-flow), evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, F1, Brier score, CRPS), and ablation studies. It also implicitly critiques by proposing a rigorous experimental setup.\n    * System B: Critiques the methodology by suggesting baselines (persistence, climatology, ConvLSTM/U-Net, optical-flow), evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, edge distance error, vector RMSE, trajectory MSE), and validation strategies (out-of-time/region tests, stress tests).\n    * **Tie**: Both systems offer good critiques and suggestions for methodology. System A is slightly more detailed in its experimental design.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a very complete and well-ordered research plan, broken down into problem framing, experiments (with detailed setups, baselines, metrics, and expected outcomes), timeline, resources, risks, and stretch ideas. The ordering is logical and covers all necessary components.\n    * System B: Provides a less complete plan, focusing on scope, data, models, and evaluation. The milestones are less detailed and cover a shorter timeframe.\n    * **Winner: A** (System A's plan is significantly more comprehensive and detailed, covering all aspects of a research plan.)\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides a good list of relevant citations, categorized by experiment. It also includes a section on literature coverage and how to expand it, showing a good understanding of the existing work and gaps.\n    * System B: Provides fewer citations, and some are marked as \"conjecture,\" indicating less certainty or direct relevance.\n    * **Winner: A** (System A provides more relevant and well-integrated citations, and a clearer strategy for literature review.)\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly outlines actionable next steps in the timeline and provides a detailed risks and mitigations table. This makes the plan very actionable and addresses potential challenges proactively.\n    * System B: Provides milestones, which are actionable, but lacks a dedicated risks and mitigations section.\n    * **Winner: A** (System A's explicit risk assessment and mitigation strategies make the plan more actionable and robust.)\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines by providing a structured plan, grounding claims in citations, and avoiding overclaiming. It also includes a section on uncertainty.\n    * System B: Adheres well to guidelines, but some claims are marked as \"conjecture,\" which is a good way to express uncertainty, but System A's plan is more concrete.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems follow the guidelines well. System A's plan is more fleshed out.\n\n### Final Winner: A\n\n**Justification:** System A provides a significantly more comprehensive, detailed, and actionable research plan. It breaks down the research into well-defined experiments with specific hypotheses, baselines, and metrics, includes a detailed timeline, resource list, and a thorough risk assessment. System B's plan is more concise but lacks the depth and completeness required for a Stage C researcher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a much more comprehensive and detailed research plan, including specific experiments, baselines, metrics, a",
