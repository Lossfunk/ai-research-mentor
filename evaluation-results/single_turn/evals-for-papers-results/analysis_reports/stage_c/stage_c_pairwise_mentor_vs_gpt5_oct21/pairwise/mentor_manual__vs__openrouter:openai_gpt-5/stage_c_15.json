      "raw": "* **System A** is better because it provides a more detailed and concrete research plan. It breaks down the experiments into specific hypotheses, setups, baselines, metrics, and expected outcomes, which is crucial for a research plan. System B's experiments are more high-level and less defined.\n* **System A** also does a better job of integrating the IRB/ethics steps throughout the plan, rather than having them as a separate section. This shows a more thoughtful approach to the ethical considerations.\n* **System A**'s timeline is more granular and includes specific milestones for each month, making it easier to track progress. System B's timeline is more general.\n\nOverall, System A presents a more robust, well-structured, and actionable research plan that directly addresses the user's prompt.\n\n## JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more detailed and concrete research plan with specific hypotheses, metrics, and timelines.
