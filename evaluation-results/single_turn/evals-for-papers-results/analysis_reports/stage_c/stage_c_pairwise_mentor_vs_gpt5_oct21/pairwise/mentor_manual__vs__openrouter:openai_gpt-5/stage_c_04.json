      "raw": "- **inquiry_quality**: A - System A's questions are more focused on the user's specific constraint (\"zero compute\") and explore concrete research avenues within that constraint. System B's questions are also relevant but slightly broader.\n- **persona_adaptation**: A - System A directly addresses the \"zero compute\" constraint by proposing research that *avoids* compute-intensive training, focusing on parameter-efficient methods, evaluation frameworks, and systematic reviews. System B also addresses it but leans more towards API-based evaluation and data-centric audits, which is a valid interpretation but perhaps less directly about *doing research* that would typically involve training or fine-tuning.\n- **methodology_critique**: A - System A provides a more detailed and structured critique of potential methodologies, including specific baselines, evaluation metrics, and experimental setups for each proposed experiment. System B's methodology sections are good but less granular.\n- **plan_completeness**: A - System A's plan is exceptionally comprehensive, detailing specific experiments, timelines with milestones, resources, risks, and even stretch ideas. System B is also comprehensive but A's structure and detail feel more complete for a research plan.\n- **literature_quality**: A - System A's citations are highly relevant to the proposed research, covering PEFT methods, evaluation harnesses, and systematic review guidelines. System B's citations are also relevant but some are marked as \"[n]\" which is less helpful.\n- **actionability_risks**: A - System A provides a well-structured table of risks and mitigations that are directly tied to the proposed experiments and the \"zero compute\" constraint. System B also does this well, but A's are slightly more specific to the proposed research.\n- **guideline_adherence**: A - System A adheres well to the persona and task, providing a detailed, actionable research plan that respects the \"no_compute\" constraint. It avoids overclaiming and grounds its suggestions in existing literature.\n\nSystem A is better because it provides a more concrete and actionable research plan that directly addresses the \"zero compute\" constraint by focusing on parameter-efficient methods, rigorous evaluation, and systematic reviews. Its experimental designs are well-defined, and the timeline and risk assessments are thorough. System B's approach is also valid but leans more towards API-based evaluation and data audits, which might be less aligned with the user's implicit desire to conduct research that *could* involve training, albeit with limited resources.\n\n### Final Winner: A\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more concrete and actionable research plan that directly addresses the 'zero compute' constraint by focusing on parameter-efficient methods, rigorous evaluation, and systematic reviews.
