      "raw": "* **A. Inquiry Quality**: System A's questions are more specific and directly address the user's constraints. System B's questions are broader and less tailored to the \"no Python\" constraint.\n* **B. Persona Adaptation**: System B is better at adapting to the persona's constraints. It focuses on no-code tools and workflows, whereas System A still implies some level of technical understanding.\n* **A. Methodology Critique**: System A provides a more thorough critique of potential methodologies, including baselines, metrics, and potential confounds. System B's critique is less detailed.\n* **A. Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A's plan is more comprehensive and logically ordered, covering all necessary aspects of research planning. System B's plan is less detailed and lacks some crucial elements.\n* **A. Literature Guidance Quality**: System A provides more relevant and up-to-date literature guidance, with a better selection of papers and tools. System B's references are less relevant and some are outdated.\n* **A. Actionability & Risks**: System A offers more concrete next steps and a more thorough risk assessment with actionable mitigations. System B's risks are more generic and less specific to the persona's constraints.\n* **A. Guideline Adherence**: System A adheres better to the guidelines by avoiding overclaiming and presenting information with appropriate uncertainty. System B makes some unsubstantiated claims and oversimplifies certain aspects.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more comprehensive, well-structured, and actionable research plan that better addresses the user's constraints. It offers a more detailed methodology critique, relevant literature guidance, and a more thorough risk assessment, making it a superior response. System B, while attempting to adhere to the no-code constraint, is less detailed and less grounded in its recommendations.\n\n## Detailed Comparison:\n\n### 1. Inquiry Quality\n\n*   **System A**: Asks specific, research-oriented questions that directly probe the user's goals and constraints (e.g., \"Do structured prompting strategies... outperform zero-shot on reasoning and truthfulness benchmarks in no-code settings?\"). These questions are well-scoped and aim to uncover novel research directions within the given limitations.\n*   **System B**: Asks broader questions about the user's desired outcomes and deliverables (e.g., \"What are your primary goals for this research?\"). While relevant, they are less focused on the *how* of research planning and more on the *what* of the final output.\n\n**Winner: A** - System A's questions are more incisive and directly geared towards planning the research methodology itself.\n\n### 2. Persona Adaptation\n\n*   **System A**: Explicitly acknowledges the \"no-code/low-code\" requirement and builds the entire plan around it, referencing vendor UIs and point-and-click tools. It also addresses the \"skills gap\" by focusing on accessibility.\n*   **System B**: Also focuses on no-code/low-code tools (Hugging Face AutoTrain, Label Studio, Prolific). It frames the research around \"meaningful, publishable AI research without writing Python.\"\n\n**Winner: Tie** - Both systems do a good job of adapting to the persona's constraints. System A feels slightly more grounded in the *evaluation* aspect of AI research, which aligns well with the prompt's implicit need for planning *how* to do research. System B leans more into *building* research artifacts.\n\n### 3. Methodology Critique\n\n*   **System A**: Offers a detailed critique within its experimental designs. For example, in Experiment 1, it specifies baselines (zero-shot prompt without abstention), evaluation metrics (exact match, accuracy, truthfulness score), and expected outcomes tied to hypotheses. Experiment 3 explicitly critiques the reliability of cloud evaluators against human judgment.\n*   **System B**: Also includes hypotheses, baselines, and metrics for each experiment. For instance, Experiment 1 contrasts fine-tuning with zero-shot prompting and lists EM/F1 as metrics. However, the critique feels less deep than System A's, particularly in how it addresses potential confounds or nuances of evaluation.\n\n**Winner: A** - System A's critique is more thorough, especially in its discussion of evaluator reliability and potential failure modes.\n\n### 4. Plan Completeness & Ordering\n\n*   **System A**: Presents a very comprehensive plan, broken down into Problem Framing, Experiments (with detailed sub-sections for each), Timeline, Resources, Risks, and Stretch Ideas. The ordering is logical, starting with high-level goals and drilling down into specifics.\n*   **System B**: Also provides a structured plan with similar sections. However, the \"Experiments\" section is slightly less detailed in its sub-components compared to System A. The timeline is also well-structured.",
