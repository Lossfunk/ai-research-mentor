This ensures the plan is based on current research and techniques.\n*   **Venue/Type:** The sources are primarily academic papers from reputable conferences (ACL, EMNLP, LREC) or pre-print servers (arXiv) for cutting-edge research. There's also a practical guide on TensorFlow Lite from learnopencv.com, which is appropriate for the 'resource-constrained' and 'on-device' aspects of the prompt. Datasets are linked to their respective academic papers or data repositories.\n*   **Relevance:** Each source directly supports a specific claim or proposed method within the research plan, such as specific datasets for benchmarking (Fakeddit, NewsCLIPpings, Weibo23), model compression techniques (Polino et al., TFLite), or federated learning for low-bandwidth (Efficient Asynchronous Federated Learning). The survey paper provides a good overview of the field.\n\nOverall, the sources are perfectly aligned with the user's goal and the technical nature of the request.",
