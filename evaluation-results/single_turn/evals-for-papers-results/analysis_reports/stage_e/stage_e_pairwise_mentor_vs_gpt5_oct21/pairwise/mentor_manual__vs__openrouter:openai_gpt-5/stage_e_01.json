      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems provide excellent, detailed lists of potential reviewer concerns. System A's concerns are slightly more granular and cover a broader range of potential issues (e.g., differential noise by field and time, leakage from post-hoc signals). System B's concerns are also very good and well-articulated.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona of a researcher anticipating reviewer concerns. They both adopt a helpful, advisory tone and provide actionable advice. System A feels slightly more proactive in its suggestions for experiments.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems excel here, identifying potential confounds, issues with baselines (implicitly, by suggesting how to handle weak labels), metrics (implicitly, by suggesting how to evaluate robustness), and leakage. System A's critique is more detailed, explicitly mentioning \"differential noise by field and time\" and \"leakage from post-hoc signals.\"\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide comprehensive plans. System A's plan is structured into \"Mitigations to state in the discussion\" and \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments,\" which is a very clear and logical ordering. System B also provides a good plan, but the separation between \"Commitments and mitigations\" and \"Three concrete, falsifiable experiments\" is slightly less distinct. System A's experiments are also more varied and cover a wider range of robustness checks.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant citations. System A's citations are more integrated into the text and directly support specific points. System B also cites well, but some of its citations are more general (e.g., the GitHub link). System A's inclusion of [P6] is particularly relevant to the \"outcome construct validity\" concern.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems offer concrete next steps and identify risks. System A's \"Mitigations to state in the discussion\" are very actionable. System B's \"Commitments and mitigations to include\" are also actionable. System A's experiments are arguably more concrete and falsifiable.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere well to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and focus on providing evidence-based suggestions. System A's inline evidence from attached material is a nice touch.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more comprehensive and granular critique of potential reviewer concerns, leading to a more detailed and actionable set of mitigations and experiments. Its structure is also slightly clearer, and its literature integration feels more natural.\n\n**Reasoning for Votes**:\n\n*   **Inquiry Quality**: A is slightly better due to more granular concerns.\n*   **Persona Adaptation**: Tie, both are excellent.\n*   **Methodology Critique**: A is better due to more detailed identification of issues like differential noise and leakage.\n*   **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: A is better due to clearer separation of mitigations and experiments, and a more diverse set of experiments.\n*   **Literature Guidance Quality**: A is better due to more integrated and directly supportive citations.\n*   **Actionability & Risks**: A is better due to more concrete and varied experimental suggestions.\n*   **Guideline Adherence**: Tie, both are excellent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more comprehensive and granular critique of potential reviewer concerns, leading to a more detailed and actionable set of mitigations and experiments.
