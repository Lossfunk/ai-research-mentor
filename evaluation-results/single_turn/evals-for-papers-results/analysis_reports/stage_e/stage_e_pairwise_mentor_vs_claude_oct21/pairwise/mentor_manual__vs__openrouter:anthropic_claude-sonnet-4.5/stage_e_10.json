      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks a direct question about how to address the skepticism and proposes a plan.\n    * System B: Does not ask a question but provides a comprehensive response to the prompt.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems understand the core task.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the prompt by composing a discussion section paragraph and then elaborating with concrete experiments. It aligns with the persona of a researcher needing to address limitations and plan extensions.\n    * System B: Provides an extremely detailed and structured response, including a full discussion section, a pilot study design, alternative minimal acknowledgments, key messaging points, and a checklist. This goes far beyond a single paragraph and feels more like a comprehensive project proposal or a set of guidelines for writing such a section. While it addresses the prompt, its sheer volume and structure might be overwhelming for a direct \"compose a discussion section paragraph\" request.\n    * **A**. System A is more focused on the specific output requested (a paragraph) while still providing the necessary detail. System B is too verbose and structured as a full document rather than a single paragraph.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Proposes concrete experiments with hypotheses, setups, metrics, and expected outcomes, which implicitly critiques potential methodological shortcomings of an English-only approach and outlines how to address them.\n    * System B: Discusses challenges for multilingual extension in detail (data availability, feature engineering, cross-lingual transfer, cultural differences) and proposes a multi-phase plan with different approaches and evaluation protocols. This is a more extensive critique and planning of methodology.\n    * **B**. System B provides a much deeper and broader critique of potential methodological issues and proposes a more robust plan to address them.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Outlines a clear, ordered list of steps for the multilingual extension. The subsequent experiments also follow a logical progression.\n    * System B: Provides a highly detailed, phased plan (5 phases over 18 months) covering data collection, feature engineering, model development, cultural analysis, and release. It also includes a pilot study design and a checklist. The ordering is logical and comprehensive.\n    * **B**. System B's plan is significantly more detailed, covering more aspects and providing a longer-term vision, making it more complete.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides two relevant literature anchors (XTREME, XNLI) with links and cites them appropriately.\n    * System B: Provides several literature anchors with links, covering multilingual models (mBERT, XLM-R), cross-lingual transfer, and even cultural differences in peer review.\n    * **B**. System B offers a broader and more diverse set of relevant literature.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Lists concrete steps for the extension plan and implicitly addresses risks by proposing solutions (e.g., updating tokenizer, language-adaptive pretraining). The experiments are actionable.\n    * System B: Explicitly lists \"Limitations and Risks\" with mitigations. The phased plan is highly actionable, with timelines, deliverables, resource requirements, and collaboration strategies.\n    * **B**. System B is much more explicit and thorough in identifying and mitigating risks, and its plan is highly actionable with detailed steps and resource considerations.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to the prompt by composing a paragraph and then elaborating. It avoids overclaiming and uses citations appropriately.\n    * System B: While providing a very thorough response, it significantly exceeds the request for a \"discussion section paragraph\" by generating a multi-document output. This might be seen as not strictly adhering to the output format requested, although the content is highly relevant. It also includes a lot of meta-commentary (\"Key Messaging Points\", \"Quick Reference\") which is not part of the requested discussion paragraph.\n    * **A**. System A is more focused on delivering the specific output requested (a paragraph) while still providing the necessary detail. System B is too verbose and structured as a full document rather than a single paragraph.\n\n### **Final Winner Justification**\n\nSystem B provides a far more comprehensive and detailed plan for addressing the multilingual extension, including a deeper critique of challenges, a more robust phased approach, and explicit risk mitigation. While System A is more concise and directly answers the prompt for a single paragraph, System B's depth and breadth make it a superior response for a research mentoring context where detailed planning and consideration of complexities are paramount.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature",
