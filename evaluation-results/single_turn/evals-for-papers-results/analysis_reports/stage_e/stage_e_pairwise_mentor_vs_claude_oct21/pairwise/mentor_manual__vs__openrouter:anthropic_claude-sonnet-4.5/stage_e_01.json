      "raw": "* **A**: System A is better because it provides a more comprehensive and actionable set of mitigations and experiments. It also correctly identifies and cites specific parts of the PeerRead dataset (ACL 2016 subset) that can be used for clean-label evaluation.\n* **B**: System B is also good, but its proposed mitigations and experiments are more general and less specific to the PeerRead dataset. It also incorrectly suggests using other PeerRead datasets (NIPS, ICLR) for validation, when the prompt specifically asks about the arXiv subset.\n\n### Aspect-by-Aspect Analysis:\n\n* **Inquiry Quality**: A is better because it asks more specific and insightful questions about the potential issues with the \"probably-rejected\" labels.\n* **Persona Adaptation**: A is better because it more closely aligns with the persona's expertise in sea ice research and the task of anticipating reviewer concerns.\n* **Methodology Critique**: A is better because it provides a more detailed and nuanced critique of the methodology, including potential confounds and leakage issues.\n* **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: A is better because it offers a more complete and well-ordered plan for addressing the reviewer concerns, including concrete experiments and discussion points.\n* **Literature Guidance Quality**: A is better because it provides more relevant and specific citations, including a direct reference to the PeerRead dataset itself.\n* **Actionability & Risks**: A is better because its proposed mitigations and experiments are more actionable and concrete.\n* **Guideline Adherence**: A is better because it adheres more closely to the persona's constraints and avoids overclaiming.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nSystem A is the clear winner. It provides a more thorough, actionable, and dataset-specific response to the user's prompt. Its proposed mitigations and experiments are more concrete and directly address the nuances of the PeerRead dataset's \"probably-rejected\" labels.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more comprehensive and actionable set of mitigations and experiments, directly referencing specific parts of the PeerRead dataset for clean-label evaluation.
