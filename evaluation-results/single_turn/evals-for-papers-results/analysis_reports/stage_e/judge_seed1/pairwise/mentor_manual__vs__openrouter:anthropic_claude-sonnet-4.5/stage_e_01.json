      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems provide excellent, detailed responses that directly address the user's prompt. They anticipate reviewer concerns and propose relevant mitigations. System B is slightly more detailed in its breakdown of concerns and mitigations, and its proposed experiments are more concrete and falsifiable.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona of a researcher (stage E) in the sea_ice domain, providing technical and methodological advice. System B's inclusion of specific literature anchors and methodological suggestions like PU learning and confident learning feels slightly more tailored to an experienced researcher.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems excel here. They identify potential confounds (selection bias, confounding by quality), discuss baselines (though System B is more explicit about PU learning as a baseline), and suggest metrics. System B's critique is more granular, touching on entity resolution and evaluation leakage.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide comprehensive plans. System A structures its response into \"Anticipated Reviewer Concerns,\" \"Proposed Discussion Section Structure,\" and \"Concrete Validation Experiments.\" System B integrates these more fluidly, presenting concerns, mitigations, experiments, and literature anchors. System B's proposed experiments are more detailed and framed as falsifiable hypotheses.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System B is superior here. It provides specific literature anchors with links and explicitly ties its points to prior work using \"[P1]\" and \"[P2]\" citations. System A provides two general sources for the PeerRead dataset but doesn't integrate broader literature as effectively into its arguments.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems offer actionable advice. System B's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is particularly strong in providing concrete next steps with clear hypotheses, designs, and metrics. Both systems implicitly highlight risks by detailing the potential flaws in the labels.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere well to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and focus on methodological rigor. System B's explicit framing of experiments as \"falsifiable\" and its detailed literature integration demonstrate a strong understanding of research best practices.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a more comprehensive and methodologically sophisticated response. Its critique of the label validity is more granular, its proposed experiments are more concrete and falsifiable, and its integration of relevant literature anchors significantly strengthens its advice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B offers a more detailed and methodologically rigorous response, including granular critiques, concrete falsifiable experiments, and stronger integration of relevant literature anchors.
