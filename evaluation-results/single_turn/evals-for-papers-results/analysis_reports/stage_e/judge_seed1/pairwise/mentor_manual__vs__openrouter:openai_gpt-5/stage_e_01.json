      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems provide excellent, detailed responses that directly address the user's prompt. They anticipate reviewer concerns and propose relevant mitigations and experiments. System A is slightly more structured in its presentation of concerns, mitigations, and experiments, making it marginally easier to follow.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona of a researcher (stage E) in the sea_ice domain, providing technical and domain-relevant advice. They both correctly identify the need for web search and research guidelines.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems excel here, offering detailed critiques of the \"probably-rejected\" labels, identifying potential confounds (selection bias, temporal censoring, entity resolution), and suggesting appropriate baselines, metrics, and ablation studies. System A's critique feels slightly more comprehensive in its breakdown of potential issues.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide complete plans, covering data issues, mitigation strategies, and experimental validation. System A's ordering of concerns, mitigations, and experiments is very logical and easy to follow.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant literature anchors. System A's integration of literature references within the \"Anticipated reviewer concerns\" and \"Mitigations\" sections, along with a dedicated \"Where this ties to prior work\" section, makes the guidance feel more deeply integrated and useful. System B's literature anchors are also relevant but less integrated.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems offer actionable advice and identify risks. System A's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is particularly strong, clearly outlining hypotheses, designs, and expected outcomes for each experiment. System B also provides good experiments, but System A's framing feels slightly more robust.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere well to the guidelines, avoiding overclaiming and grounding their advice in potential research practices.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A.\n\n**Justification**: System A is slightly better due to its more structured and comprehensive presentation of reviewer concerns, mitigations, and experimental designs. Its integration of literature references within the discussion of concerns and mitigations also makes the guidance feel more directly applicable. Both systems are excellent, but System A's organization and depth give it a slight edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more structured and comprehensive breakdown of reviewer concerns, mitigations, and experimental designs.
