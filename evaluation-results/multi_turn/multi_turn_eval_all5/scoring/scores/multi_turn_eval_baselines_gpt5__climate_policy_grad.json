      "mentor_reply": "Stage: A – Pre-idea to focused idea\n\nGreat domain choice. With 5 hours/week and county-level data, you can make real progress by scoping tightly and building a reproducible “Phase 0” pilot that you can iterate on.\n\nQuick intake questions\n- Which county-level datasets do you actually have in hand (emissions inventories, electricity use, building stock, EV registrations, policy adoption dates, demographics)?\n- What’s your near-term milestone: a class project, policy memo, conference poster, or a working paper? Timeline?\n- Do you have any mentorship/collaborators (faculty, local agency contacts)?\n- Compute: can you run basic Python notebooks locally; any restrictions on data access?\n- Biggest bottleneck right now: picking a question, finding data, methods, or tooling?\n\nPhase 0 (≤14 days, ≈10 hours): minimal, verifiable start\nDeliverables\n1) Prediction log: 14 small predictions (one per scenario or county) with a one-line rationale, and one reproduced figure/metric from a public simulator. \n2) One experiment card + one ablation/negative result (see below).\nTooling\n- Start from an open simulator to avoid heavy modeling: En-ROADS (global, transparent policy levers) and the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) for the U.S. (open-source, sector detail) [P1][P3][P4]. Use these to define scenarios and sanity-check monotonicity/sensitivity before any econometrics [P2]. \n- Use NGFS scenario-analysis guidance to frame your scenarios and validation targets (define horizon, outputs, and comparison baselines) [P6][P8].\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (compact and doable)\n1) Backtest a simple policy scenario\n- Objective & hypothesis: Choose a past policy shock (e.g., a state joining RGGI or tightening building codes). Hypothesis: A simple reduced-form scenario will correctly predict the sign and approximate magnitude (within X% tolerance you pre-specify) of county-level building- or power-sector emissions change over 2–4 years.\n- Setup: Use EPS to set a policy lever that mirrors the historical change at state level; map predicted state-sector changes to counties using proportional weights (e.g., baseline emissions shares). Data: historical county outcomes for the sector you choose.\n- Metrics: Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) versus actuals; directional accuracy; calibration plot.\n- Interpretation: If sign is wrong or MAPE is large, document which driver (activity vs. intensity) mispredicts; that’s your negative result.\n- Follow-ups: Ablate one driver at a time in EPS (e.g., fuel price elasticity, compliance rate) to see which assumption reduces error most [P3][P4].\n\n2) Difference-in-differences on a single lever\n- Objective & hypothesis: Did counties in states with stricter building codes exhibit larger per-capita electricity use reductions vs. matched controls? Hypothesis: Treated counties show a statistically significant additional decline versus controls after adoption.\n- Setup: Build a county panel (5–10 years), define treatment timing from policy records, controls via propensity score or exact matching on baseline load and income. Model: two-way fixed effects DiD (statsmodels).\n- Metrics: ATT with CIs, pre-trend test, placebo tests with fake adoption years.\n- Interpretation: If pre-trends fail, switch to staggered-adoption estimators or synthetic controls; report robustness as part of Phase 0 “ablation.”\n- Follow-ups: Compare the DiD point estimate to EPS’s implied effect for the same period to assess model realism [P3][P6].\n\n3) Model comparison sanity check (En-ROADS vs. EPS)\n- Objective & hypothesis: For a single policy lever (e.g., moderate carbon price), the direction of change and sectoral ordering of impacts (power > industry > buildings, for example) should align across models at the state aggregate. Hypothesis: Rank correlation of sectoral emissions changes is ≥0.7 across En-ROADS and EPS.\n- Setup: Run one scenario in both tools with matched levers; extract sectoral percent changes for your state(s) of interest.\n- Metrics: Spearman rank correlation, absolute differences by sector.\n- Interpretation: If rankings diverge, inspect each model’s documentation to identify structural differences (e.g., technology learning vs. static cost curves) and write up as a methodological note.\n- Follow-ups: Use the more conservative model as your baseline for county extrapolation [P1][P2][P3][P4].\n\nRecommendations tailored to your constraints\n- Low time/compute: Anchor on EPS/En-ROADS for scenario definitions and sensitivity checks, then run one reduced-form validation (backtest or DiD) with a single sector and a single state to keep scope tight [P1][P3][P6]. \n- Outputs you can publish quickly: a transparent notebook, a short memo with one figure comparing model vs. reality, and a brief “what failed and why” section.\n\nNext actions (this week, 2–3 hours)\n- Pick one lever, one sector, one state; tell me your datasets.\n- Draft one-page experiment card (hypothesis, falsifier, minimal test, variables, analysis plan, stop rule).\n- Reproduce one EPS scenario figure for your state and log 7 predictions from sensitivity sweeps [P3][P4].\n\nIntuition\n- Start from validated simulators to stand on others’ work, then shrink the gap to local reality with one narrow, testable check. This lets you learn the error surface cheaply before building complex models.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Open simulators like En-ROADS/EPS encode sectoral mechanisms and transparent policy levers; using them for scoping and sensitivities follows standard scenario-analysis practice [P1][P2][P3][P6]. \n- Framing with NGFS-aligned scenarios and simple causal designs (DiD/backtests) provides clear falsification paths and guards against overfitting and unvalidated counterfactuals [P6][P8].\n\nAnchors (read these first)\n- En-ROADS overview and user guide (for quick policy levers and transparent assumptions) [P1][P2].\n- Energy Policy Simulator documentation (for U.S.-specific policy levers and data structure) [P3][P4].\n\nCitations\n- [P1] En-ROADS - Climate Interactive — https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/\n- [P2] En-ROADS User Guide — https://docs.climateinteractive.org/projects/en-roads/en/latest/index.html\n- [P3] U.S. Energy Policy Simulator | Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- [P4] Introduction | Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/\n- [P6] Guide to climate scenario analysis for central banks and supervisors — https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/ngfs_guide_scenario_analysis_final.pdf",

      "mentor_reply": "Stage: B – Idea to research plan\n\nGreat—experiment #1 is the right choice for your time and data. Let’s lock a narrow, backtestable question and build the memo around one compelling figure comparing model predictions to county outcomes.\n\nStrategic questions to finalize scope\n- Which lever and state will you backtest? Two tractable options: (a) RGGI’s 2009 start in a participating state; or (b) a specific state RPS/carbon price episode captured in EPS. Pick one state and one lever.\n- Outcome and metric: power-sector CO2 (county-aggregated) or county electricity consumption? For the memo figure, do you want absolute error bars by county, or a calibration plot vs. predicted change?\n- Allocation rule: how will you map state-level EPS predictions to counties—baseline emissions shares, plant-level attribution, or population-weighted? Choose one primary method and one alternative for ablation.\n- Error tolerance: what’s your success criterion (e.g., MAPE ≤ 25% and ≥70% correct direction of change over 2–4 years)?\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (doable in ~5 hours/week)\n\n1) EPS backtest of a past policy shock (core result)\n- Objective & hypothesis: Using EPS to mirror a historical policy (e.g., RGGI start) will predict the sign and approximate magnitude of county-level power-sector CO2 changes over 2–4 years; hypothesis: MAPE ≤ 25% and ≥70% directional accuracy.\n- Setup: Select a single state and policy year. Run the analogous lever in EPS; extract state-sector percent change. Allocate to counties via baseline emissions shares (EPA inventory, pre-policy year). Use your EPA county inventory as ground truth. Document lever settings and assumptions consistent with scenario-analysis guidance [1][2].\n- Metrics: Mean absolute percentage error, sign accuracy, and a calibration plot (predicted vs. observed county changes). Pre-register a minimal threshold before running.\n- Interpretation: If large errors occur, tag whether they come from activity vs. intensity. This negative result is valuable—record it in your prediction log and experiment card [1][2][3].\n- Follow-ups: Single-parameter sensitivity in EPS (compliance rate or fuel price pass-through) to see if one assumption closes most of the error; limit to two sweeps for Phase 0 [2][3].\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation (robustness figure)\n- Objective & hypothesis: The choice of county allocation rule explains a large share of error; hypothesis: plant-level attribution (when available) outperforms simple baseline-share or population weighting.\n- Setup: Create three county allocations of the same state-level EPS prediction: (a) baseline emissions shares; (b) population-weighted; (c) plant-level mapping where major facilities drive county effects (can be proxied by facility county totals from EPA inventory).\n- Metrics: Compare MAPE and R^2 across methods; report ΔMAPE as the ablation effect.\n- Interpretation: If a simpler rule is competitive, pick it as your default and document why (simplicity and reproducibility). If not, justify the extra complexity in the memo.\n\n3) External validity check against empirical literature (sanity anchor)\n- Objective & hypothesis: Your backtest’s state-level aggregate change should align in sign and rough magnitude with published RGGI estimates; hypothesis: direction matches and your magnitude is within a broad ±30–40% band.\n- Setup: Aggregate your county results to state-level, compare to an empirical benchmark like Murray and Maniloff (2015) on RGGI power-sector impacts, and note any divergence as a model-structure vs. data-allocation issue [4].\n- Metrics: Directional agreement, percent difference vs. benchmark estimate.\n- Interpretation: Agreement suggests your mapping is reasonable; disagreement motivates a sensitivity write-up or model choice note in the memo.\n\nEight-week plan (Phase 0 gated)\n- Week 1–2 (Phase 0): Pick state+lever, write a one-page experiment card, reproduce one EPS scenario figure, log 14 predictions from two sensitivity sweeps; run the core backtest for one year window [2][3]. Gate: one reproduced plot and one ablation/negative result recorded.\n- Week 3–4: Extend to a 2–4 year window; run allocation-method ablation; draft the memo figure (calibration + county choropleth).\n- Week 5–6: External validity check vs. literature; tighten analysis; write methods.\n- Week 7–8: Polish memo, add limitations and policy implications.\n\nRecommendations tailored to your data/time\n- Choose a power-sector lever (RGGI or carbon price) and one state with good county inventory coverage. Start with the simplest allocation rule; keep plant-level mapping as an optional improvement if time permits. Frame the memo using NGFS-style scenario transparency and document assumptions and sensitivities [1][2][3].\n\nNext actions (this week, 2–3 hours)\n- Decide: state, lever, outcome metric, and error tolerance. Share your choices and I’ll help draft the experiment card text.\n- Reproduce one EPS state-level scenario plot and export predicted percent change for the power sector [2].\n- Build a one-year county panel (t−1, t+2 around policy) from the EPA inventory and compute deltas.\n\nIntuition\n- Start with a mechanistic simulator to propose a directional, quantitative claim, then test it against simple, observable county outcomes. The allocation method is likely the biggest error source—probing it yields insight without heavy modeling.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Scenario-analysis best practice emphasizes transparent levers, documentation of assumptions, and sensitivity checks before complex causal inference; EPS/En-ROADS provide this scaffold [1][2][3]. Using literature benchmarks like RGGI evaluations adds an external validity anchor that reduces the risk of overfitting to your dataset within a small-sample, low-time project [4].\n\nCitations\n- [1] Guide to climate scenario analysis for central banks and supervisors — https://www.ngfs.net/system/files/import/ngfs/medias/documents/ngfs_guide_scenario_analysis_final.pdf\n- [2] U.S. Energy Policy Simulator — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- [3] En-ROADS User Guide — https://docs.climateinteractive.org/projects/en-roads/en/latest/\n- [4] Murray, B. and Maniloff, P.

New York’s 2009 RGGI start with county-aggregated power CO2 is tractable and policy-relevant. Let’s finalize the experiment card, tighten the evaluation window, and line up your memo figure.\n\nStrategic questions\n- Window: Do you prefer a narrow backtest (2008 vs. 2011) or a smoothed pre/post (mean of 2006–2008 vs. 2010–2012) to reduce volatility from weather and the recession?\n- Carbon price path: Will you match early RGGI clearing prices (≈$3–$5/ton) or run a sweep (0–10 $/t) and choose the best-fitting path ex post? If ex post, note this as exploratory.\n- Confounders: Any known 2008–2011 NY plant retirements or fuel-switch events you want to tag? Your regional planning contact could flag these.\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (ready-to-run)\n1) Core EPS backtest: RGGI 2009 in NY\n- Objective & hypothesis: A state-level EPS scenario mimicking early RGGI will predict county-level 2011 power CO2 changes from a 2008 baseline within MAPE ≤ 25–30% and ≥70% correct sign. Falsifier: MAPE > 30% or sign accuracy < 60%.\n- Setup: Use the NY State Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) or the US EPS NY model variant. Implement a carbon price starting 2009 at ~$3–5/ton; extract predicted percent change in power-sector CO2 for 2011 vs. 2008. Allocate state predicted change to counties using 2008 county baseline emissions shares from your EPA inventory; compute observed 2011 vs. 2008 county changes.\n- Metrics: MAPE, sign accuracy, and a calibration plot (predicted vs observed).\n- Interpretation: If errors are large, classify whether counties with small baselines dominate MAPE, or whether statewide intensity/activity mismatch drives errors.\n- Follow-ups: One-parameter sensitivity on carbon price path (+/− 2 $/t) or compliance rate to see if a single lever reduces MAPE by ≥10% (record in prediction log).\n- Anchor: EPS documentation for model levers and outputs clarifies policy-to-emissions mappings (Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us). For context on RGGI magnitude, see Murray & Maniloff 2015 (Energy Economics) — https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeeneeco/v_3a51_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a581-589.htm.\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation\n- Objective & hypothesis: Allocation choice explains a meaningful share of error. Hypothesis: baseline emissions shares outperform population-weighted mapping by ≥5 percentage points in MAPE.\n- Setup: Produce county predictions under two mappings: (a) baseline emissions shares (primary), (b) population-weighted (ablation). Keep the EPS state-level percent change fixed.\n- Metrics: ΔMAPE, ΔR^2, sign accuracy change.\n- Interpretation: If population performs similarly, prefer it for simplicity and transparency; if baseline shares win clearly, justify the extra data work in the memo.\n\n3) Placebo and stability check\n- Objective & hypothesis: The pipeline does not generate spurious “effects” in the pre-period. Hypothesis: Applying a fake policy start in 2006 yields sign accuracy near 50% and MAPE that is not better than the true-post period.\n- Setup: Repeat the pipeline with 2005 vs. 2008 as a placebo window using the same EPS settings (but zero carbon price); report placebo MAPE/sign accuracy.\n- Metrics: Placebo vs. true-post MAPE difference; should favor the true policy window.\n- Interpretation: If placebo “outperforms” true-post, flag model misspecification or allocation issues and tighten your claims.\n\nMemo figure plan (one compelling graphic)\n- Panel A: County choropleth of absolute error |predicted − observed| in tons or percent.\n- Panel B: Calibration scatter (county predicted vs observed percent change) with 45-degree line and label a few outlier counties.\n- Caption: Note policy lever, years, allocation rule, MAPE, sign accuracy, and one-sentence sensitivity outcome.\n\nExperiment card (copy/paste and fill)\n- Hypothesis: EPS-predicted NY power CO2 change from a 2008 baseline to 2011 under a $3–5/t carbon price will achieve MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% sign accuracy at the county level.\n- Falsifier: MAPE > 30% or sign accuracy < 60%.\n- Minimal test: Single post year (2011) vs. 2008; baseline-share allocation; one EPS run; compute MAPE and sign accuracy.\n- Variables: Independent—EPS carbon price (2009 start), allocation rule. Dependent—county ΔCO2 (%). Controls—use same county list and consistent inventory method across years.\n- Expected patterns: Larger baseline-emitting counties show smaller relative error; population-weighting degrades fit.\n- Analysis plan: MAPE, sign accuracy, calibration plot, choropleth, sensitivity ±$2/t; pre-register thresholds.\n- Stop rule: If falsified, try one sensitivity; if still falsified, write negative-result memo with diagnosis and halt.\n\nMinimal code outline (pseudo-Python)\n- Pull EPS state-level percent change for 2011 vs 2008: p = pct_change_power_CO2\n- Load EPA county emissions for 2008, 2011; compute obs_pct = (CO2_2011 − CO2_2008) / CO2_2008\n- Compute weights w_i = CO2_2008_i / sum_i CO2_2008_i\n- Predicted county change pred_pct_i = p (same for all counties); or, if you want a level prediction: pred_CO2_2011_i = CO2_2008_i * (1 + p)\n- Metrics: mape = mean(abs(obs_pct − pred_pct_i)); sign_acc = mean(sign(obs_pct) == sign(pred_pct_i))\n\nTailored recommendations\n- Consider widening MAPE tolerance to 30% for county-level noise; keep the ≥70% sign accuracy target. Use a smoothed pre/post (mean 2006–2008 vs 2010–2012) if your baseline looks volatile.\n- Ask your regional planning contact to flag any unit retirements or major plant retrofits 2008–2011; note them as potential outliers and report results with and without those counties.\n\nNext actions (this week, 2–3 hours)\n- Lock the window (single-year vs smoothed) and carbon price path approach (fixed vs sweep).\n- Run the minimal test and compute MAPE and sign accuracy; make the calibration scatter.\n- Start the prediction log with 7 short entries from sensitivity sweeps (e.g., $3, $4, $5/t; baseline vs population allocation).\n\nIntuition\n- A simple, transparent simulator-to-county mapping plus a placebo check will quickly reveal whether the main error comes from the model’s statewide intensity change or your county allocation—without overbuilding methods.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Scenario analysis best practice emphasizes transparent levers, documented assumptions, and limited sensitivities before causal claims; EPS provides clear policy-to-emissions mappings suitable for this purpose. Anchoring your backtest against published RGGI evaluations adds an external validity check and guards against overinterpreting noisy county variation.\n\nCitations\n- U.S./New York Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

It really helps to see how these pieces fit together. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n*   **Lever and State:** I'll focus on **RGGI's 2009 start** in **New York**. It's a well-documented policy, and I have good county-level data for NY.\n*   **Outcome and Metric:** I want to look at **power-sector CO2 (county-aggregated)**. For the memo figure, I think **absolute error bars by county** would be most impactful to show the spatial variation in predictions.\n*   **Allocation Rule:** I'll start with **baseline emissions shares** as the primary method and use **population-weighted** as the alternative for ablation. This keeps it manageable for the first pass.\n*   **Error Tolerance:** I'll aim for **MAPE ≤ 25% and ≥70% correct direction of change** over 2–4 years. This feels ambitious",

If unsure, I can suggest a quick triage workflow.\n- Baseline zeros/small emitters: will you exclude counties with near-zero 2008 power CO2 (e.g., <10,000 tCO2) from MAPE to avoid division-by-small artifacts, or switch to sMAPE? Pick one rule and pre-register it.\n\nReady-to-run experiments (aligned to your choices)\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Objective & hypothesis: A state-level EPS carbon price path (starting 2009 at ~$3–5/t, held through 2011) predicts the sign and approximate magnitude of county-level power CO2 change from 2008 to 2011. Hypothesis: MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% sign accuracy.\n- Setup: In EPS, set a carbon price to mirror early RGGI auctions (~$3–5/t); export state-level percent change in power-sector CO2 for 2011 vs. 2008. Compute 2008 county weights from EPA inventory; predict county percent changes by applying the state percent to each county. Observed county changes come from EPA 2011 vs. 2008.\n- Metrics: MAPE (or sMAPE, if you keep small counties), sign accuracy, calibration scatter.\n- Interpretation: If error is high, classify whether it’s dominated by small-baseline counties or statewide mismatch. Record a one-sentence diagnosis in your prediction log.\n- Follow-ups: Single-parameter sensitivity on carbon price ±$2/t; report ΔMAPE and whether sign accuracy improves.\n- Anchor: Energy Policy Simulator documentation covers carbon-price levers and outputs; use it to document assumptions in your memo.\n\n2) Allocation ablation\n- Objective & hypothesis: Allocation drives a meaningful share of error. Hypothesis: baseline-share allocation beats population-weighted by ≥5 pp in MAPE.\n- Setup: Hold the EPS state percent change fixed; recompute county predictions under population-weighting. Keep the same county set and windows.\n- Metrics: ΔMAPE, ΔR^2, and sign accuracy change.\n- Interpretation: If population-weighting performs similarly, prefer it for simplicity; if baseline-shares win clearly, justify the extra data step in the memo.\n\n3) Placebo stability check\n- Objective & hypothesis: Pipeline does not invent spurious pre-trends. Hypothesis: A placebo window (2005→2008, no carbon price) yields MAPE not better than the true post window and ≈50% sign accuracy.\n- Setup: Repeat the full pipeline on 2005→2008 with EPS carbon price set to $0; compute MAPE/sign accuracy.\n- Metrics: Difference in MAPE between placebo and true post; sign accuracy comparison.\n- Interpretation: If placebo “outperforms,” flag allocation or data volatility issues; add a brief limitations note.\n\nMemo figure plan\n- Panel A: County choropleth of absolute percent error |predicted − observed|.\n- Panel B: Calibration scatter with 45° line; label 3–5 outlier counties; annotate overall MAPE and sign accuracy.\n- Caption: Specify EPS lever settings, years, allocation rule, and one-sentence sensitivity outcome.\n\nConcrete steps for this week (2–3 hours)\n- Data prep\n  - Load EPA county power-sector CO2 for 2008 and 2011; define a clean county set and handle zeros (exclude <10,000 tCO2 or switch to sMAPE).\n  - Compute county weights w_i = CO2_2008_i / sum_i CO2_2008_i and a population series for the ablation.\n- EPS runs\n  - Set carbon price path to approximate early RGGI auctions (e.g., $3→$4→$5/t for 2009–2011); export state-level power CO2 percent change 2011 vs. 2008.\n  - Log three predictions: $3, $4, $5/t outcomes and your expected direction/magnitude before viewing results.\n- Evaluation\n  - Compute county predicted vs. observed changes, MAPE (or sMAPE), sign accuracy; build the calibration scatter.\n  - Create the population-weighted ablation and compute ΔMAPE.\n  - Start a brief “diagnosis” note for outliers; if your planning contact flags major unit events, mark those counties and re-report metrics excluding them.\n\nThree 2-hour next-step options (pick one if you’re unsure about confounders)\n- A) Run the core backtest now, exclude counties <10,000 tCO2 in baseline; note outliers post hoc.\n- B) Quick triage: scan EPA facility data/eGRID for NY coal/gas units with large 2008–2011 changes; tag those counties as “event counties,” then run the backtest with and without them.\n- C) While awaiting your contact’s reply, run the placebo check and build the memo figure skeleton; drop in real numbers later.\n\nExperiment card (finalized text you can paste)\n- Hypothesis: Under a $3–5/t carbon price starting 2009 in EPS, NY’s county-level power CO2 changes from 2008→2011 will achieve MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% sign accuracy.\n- Falsifier: MAPE > 30% or sign accuracy < 60%.\n- Minimal test: Single post year (2011) vs. 2008; baseline-share allocation; fixed carbon-price path mirroring early RGGI; compute MAPE/sign accuracy and a calibration plot.\n- Variables: Independent—carbon price path, allocation rule. Dependent—county ΔCO2 (%). Controls—consistent county set and inventory method across years; optional exclusion of counties with baseline <10,000 tCO2.\n- Analysis plan: Primary metric MAPE (or sMAPE if including small counties), secondary sign accuracy; sensitivity ±$2/t; ablation with population-weighted allocation; placebo 2005→2008.\n- Stop rule: If falsified, attempt one sensitivity; if still falsified, document a negative result with diagnosis and stop.\n\nIntuition\n- You’re testing whether a simple, transparent statewide mechanism (RGGI carbon price) explains county-level changes once you account for baseline exposure. If it mostly does, errors should cluster in small or special-event counties; if not, the statewide mechanism or allocation is off.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Anchoring on a well-documented simulator and policy lever, documenting assumptions, and running limited sensitivities and a placebo aligns with scenario-analysis best practice and produces falsifiable claims suitable for a policy memo. Comparing simulator predictions to observed outcomes and a simple ablation provides a clean external validity and robustness check against overinterpreting noisy spatial variation.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

      "student_message": "This is incredibly detailed and helpful! Thank you for laying out the experiments so clearly. \n\nTo answer your strategic questions:\n\n- **Window:** I think a **narrow backtest (2008 vs. 2011)** makes the most sense for this initial experiment. It's more direct for a first pass, and I can always smooth it out later if needed. Given the recession, I'm a bit worried about smoothing obscuring the policy effect.\n- **Carbon price path:** I'll go with matching **early RGGI clearing prices (≈$3–$5/ton)** for the core backtest. It feels more grounded for the initial hypothesis. I'll note the sweep approach as exploratory for follow-ups if the initial results are compelling but need refinement.\n- **Confounders:** I'll reach out to my regional planning contact this week to ask about any known plant retirements or fuel-switch events between 2008-2011.

Below is a 90–120 minute “quick triage” workflow to flag event counties before you run the core backtest, plus a compact experiment set and next steps.\n\nQuick triage workflow for event counties (fast and reproducible)\n- Define your clean county set\n  - Exclude counties with 2008 power CO2 < 10,000 t to avoid division-by-small artifacts.\n  - Freeze this list and log it in your notebook.\n- Compute residuals and flag statistical outliers\n  - Compute observed county percent change: (CO2_2011 − CO2_2008)/CO2_2008.\n  - Get the EPS state-level percent change for 2011 vs 2008 under ~$3–5/t; assign it as each county’s predicted change.\n  - Residual r_i = observed_i − predicted_state. Flag outliers where |r_i| ≥ 20 percentage points OR in the top-5 absolute residuals.\n- Facility-level sanity cross-check (lightweight)\n  - Download eGRID for 2009/2012 (or nearest vintages) and EIA-860 unit status for 2008–2011. Map plants to counties (eGRID has county fields).\n  - Flag counties where any plant had a notable event:\n    - Retirement or mothball listed 2008–2011, or\n    - Net summer capacity change ≥ 50 MW, or\n    - Generation drop ≥ 40% at a coal/gas unit (approximate via eGRID gen or EIA-923 if time permits).\n- Create event_county indicator and two evaluation sets\n  - event_county = outlier OR facility_event.\n  - Compute MAPE and sign accuracy on: (a) all clean counties, (b) excluding event_county.\n  - Keep a short note: “EPS mismatch vs. allocation vs. discrete events?” to guide interpretation and memo text.\n- Quick confirmation with your regional contact\n  - Send the list of event_counties and ask for any known retirements/fuel switches 2008–2011; note confirmations in your appendix.\n\nConcrete, falsifiable experiments (aligned to your plan)\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Objective & hypothesis: EPS with a $3–5/t price starting 2009 predicts county-level power CO2 changes 2008→2011. Hypothesis: MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% sign accuracy on the clean county set.\n- Setup: EPS export of 2011 vs 2008 state percent change; baseline-share allocation; exclude <10,000 t counties. Observed county changes from EPA inventory.\n- Metrics: MAPE (primary), sign accuracy, calibration scatter; report both including and excluding event_counties.\n- Expected results: Largest errors concentrate in event_counties and very small baselines.\n- Interpretation: If MAPE > 30% or sign accuracy < 60%, record as falsified; diagnose whether the gap is statewide intensity mismatch or allocation artifacts. Follow-up: ±$2/t price sensitivity.\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation\n- Objective & hypothesis: Allocation choice affects fit. Hypothesis: baseline-share beats population-weighted by ≥5 pp MAPE on the clean set.\n- Setup: Hold the same EPS state percent change; compute county predictions using population weights. Keep identical county set and years.\n- Metrics: ΔMAPE, ΔR^2, change in sign accuracy; report both with/without event_counties.\n- Expected results: Baseline-share improves fit; if not, prefer population-weighted for simplicity.\n- Interpretation: If ΔMAPE is small (<2 pp), document that allocation is second-order for this case.\n\n3) Event-county exclusion test (targeted robustness)\n- Objective & hypothesis: Discrete plant events explain a meaningful share of error. Hypothesis: Excluding event_counties improves MAPE by ≥10 pp without materially changing sign accuracy.\n- Setup: Use event_county indicator from the triage workflow; recompute metrics on the reduced set.\n- Metrics: ΔMAPE and Δ sign accuracy relative to full clean set.\n- Expected results: Notable MAPE reduction; outliers cluster in event_counties.\n- Interpretation: If metrics barely change, errors likely stem from statewide intensity prediction or allocation, not discrete events. Follow-up: consider plant-level mapping only for those outlier counties.\n\n4) Placebo stability check (optional but quick)\n- Objective & hypothesis: Pipeline doesn’t create spurious “effects.” Hypothesis: 2005→2008 (no price) yields ≈50% sign accuracy and worse or similar MAPE vs. 2008→2011.\n- Setup: Same pipeline, carbon price = $0; compute metrics.\n- Interpretation: If placebo outperforms, revisit allocation and small-county rule.\n\nMinimal code sketch for triage\n- Compute residuals and outliers:\n  - obs_pct = (co2_2011 - co2_2008)/co2_2008\n  - pred_state = eps_pct_change_2011_vs_2008\n  - resid = obs_pct - pred_state\n  - outlier = abs(resid) >= 0.20 or rank_abs_resid <= 5\n- Merge eGRID/EIA indicators:\n  - event_facility = (retired_2008_2011) or (delta_capacity_mw >= 50) or (delta_gen_pct <= -0.40)\n- event_county = outlier or event_facility\n- Evaluate MAPE and sign accuracy with and without event_county\n\nNext actions (this week, ~2 hours)\n- Implement the triage workflow and generate event_county flags.\n- Run the core backtest and allocation ablation on the clean set; report metrics with and without event_counties.\n- Build the calibration scatter and a quick choropleth of absolute percent error; annotate event_counties.\n\nIntuition\n- Most county-level error will come from a few discrete plant events or from allocation mismatches rather than diffuse statewide dynamics. Quickly separating “event” from “non-event” counties focuses your analysis and clarifies what EPS can and cannot explain.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Triaging outliers and documenting discrete structural breaks before drawing conclusions aligns with robust empirical practice and scenario-analysis transparency.

      "mentor_reply": "Stage: C – Research plan locked; executing Phase 0\n\nYou’re in great shape. Let’s make your week smooth with a tight notebook skeleton, quick quality checks, and a memo-ready caption/template. We’ll also lock three falsifiable experiments so your summary table writes itself.\n\nStrategic questions\n- Metric weighting: do you want county metrics unweighted, or weighted by 2008 baseline CO2 to avoid small counties dominating? I suggest reporting both and leading with weighted.\n- Confidence intervals: do you want simple bootstrap CIs over counties for MAPE and sign accuracy? If yes, use 1,000 bootstrap resamples on the clean set.\n- Visualization: should the calibration scatter use bubble size proportional to 2008 CO2 and color to mark event_counties?\n- Output cadence: where will you keep your prediction log (top of the notebook as a markdown table, or a CSV you append to each run)?\n\nNotebook skeleton (doable in 60–90 minutes)\n- Load and clean\n  - Read EPA county power CO2 for 2008 and 2011; harmonize FIPS and units; filter to a clean set excluding counties with 2008 CO2 < 10,000 t.\n  - Compute county weights w_i = CO2_2008_i / sum(CO2_2008).\n- EPS state percent change\n  - Run EPS with a $3–$5/t carbon price path (2009–2011). Export state-level power CO2 percent change 2011 vs 2008 (p). Log your prior for sign accuracy and MAPE before viewing results.\n- Predicted vs observed\n  - obs_pct_i = (CO2_2011_i − CO2_2008_i)/CO2_2008_i\n  - pred_pct_i = p (uniform across counties under the baseline-share rule)\n  - For levels: pred_CO2_2011_i = CO2_2008_i * (1 + p)\n- Metrics utilities\n  - MAPE_pct(y_true, y_pred) on percent changes; sMAPE optional if you later include small counties.\n  - Weighted MAPE: sum(w_i * abs(obs_pct_i − p)); Sign accuracy: mean(sign(obs_pct_i) == sign(p)).\n  - Bootstrap CIs: resample counties (with replacement), recompute metrics 1,000 times; take 2.5/97.5 percentiles.\n- Quick triage for event counties\n  - resid_i = obs_pct_i − p; outlier flag if |resid_i| ≥ 0.20 or in top-5 |resid|.\n  - Merge a light plant-event indicator from eGRID/EIA-860 if time allows; event_county = outlier OR plant_event.\n- Allocation ablation\n  - Replace weights with population shares for predicted levels, then convert to percent changes. Recompute metrics and ΔMAPE, both with and without event_counties.\n- Figures\n  - Choropleth: absolute percent error by county; hatch or outline event_counties.\n  - Calibration scatter: x = predicted percent change (p), y = obs_pct_i; bubble size ~ CO2_2008_i; color = event_county; annotate MAPE and sign accuracy in the subtitle.\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Hypothesis: Under a $3–$5/t carbon price starting in 2009, EPS predicts county-level power CO2 changes 2008→2011 with MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% sign accuracy on the clean set.\n- Minimal test: Single EPS run (p), baseline-share mapping, exclude <10,000 t counties; compute MAPE (weighted and unweighted), sign accuracy, bootstrap CIs; calibration scatter and choropleth.\n- Falsifier: MAPE > 30% or sign accuracy < 60%. Expected follow-up: ±$2/t sensitivity; report ΔMAPE and whether sign accuracy improves.\n- Literature anchor: Murray & Maniloff (2015) for expected state-level RGGI magnitude context; cite in memo background.\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation\n- Hypothesis: Baseline-share allocation outperforms population-weighted by ≥5 percentage points in MAPE on the clean set.\n- Minimal test: Hold p fixed; recompute predictions with population weights; compute ΔMAPE (weighted and unweighted), ΔR^2, and Δ sign accuracy; report with and without event_counties.\n- Falsifier: ΔMAPE < 2 pp (allocation second-order). Follow-up: if small, prefer population weighting for simplicity and document rationale.\n\n3) Event-county exclusion robustness\n- Hypothesis: Excluding event_counties improves MAPE by ≥10 pp without materially changing sign accuracy.\n- Minimal test: Compute metrics on clean set vs. clean minus event_counties; ΔMAPE and Δ sign accuracy; show both on the calibration plot (e.g., different markers).\n- Interpretation: If improvement is small, error stems from statewide intensity mismatch (model) or mapping assumptions, not discrete events—note in limitations.\n\nOptional quick add-on\n- Placebo check (2005→2008, p=0): Expect ≈50% sign accuracy and similar or worse MAPE than the true post period; if it “wins,” revisit allocation or data volatility.\n\nSummary table template (drop these rows/cols into your memo)\n- Rows: Clean set; Clean – event_counties; Allocation (population) on clean; Allocation (population) on clean – event_counties.\n- Columns: N counties; MAPE (unweighted); MAPE (weighted by 2008 CO2); Sign accuracy; ΔMAPE vs. baseline.\n\nMemo caption template\n- “Predicted vs. observed changes in county power-sector CO2, New York (2008→2011). EPS scenario mimics early RGGI carbon prices ($3–$5/t starting 2009). Predictions allocate the state-level percent change uniformly across counties proportional to 2008 emissions. Panel A maps absolute percent error by county; Panel B shows calibration with county bubbles sized by 2008 CO2 and event_counties outlined. Overall MAPE = X% (Y% weighted), sign accuracy = Z%. Sensitivity: ±$2/t changes MAPE by Δ and does/does not affect sign accuracy. Allocation ablation yields ΔMAPE of A pp. See Methods for exclusion rule (<10,000 t) and event-county definition.”\n\nPitfalls to avoid\n- Scope consistency: ensure the EPA series is CO2 (not CO2e) and matches the power-sector definition across both years.\n- Denominator issues: document excluded counties and why; maintain the same county set across comparisons.\n- Double counting: when computing population-weighted predictions, keep the state total consistent so percent change is comparable.\n- EPS documentation: record the exact carbon price path and any default assumptions you changed for replicability.\n\nNext actions (2–3 hours)\n- Implement the notebook skeleton through figures; run the triage flag; produce the summary table.\n- Send the event_counties list to your NYSERDA contact for quick confirmation; note any plant-specific events.\n- Post your prediction log (7+ entries) at the top of the notebook; I can help refine wording for the memo once you paste the summary table.\n\nIntuition\n- Most of the spatial error will come from a handful of discrete plant events and small baselines, not from the statewide price signal itself. Cleanly partitioning those lets you evaluate the simulator’s statewide mechanism without conflating it with local shocks.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- You’re making a falsifiable claim with pre-registered thresholds, checking robustness via allocation ablation, and validating stability with a placebo—all standard, transparent scenario-analysis and empirical hygiene steps. Anchoring expectations to published RGGI evidence avoids overfitting and keeps your memo grounded in established magnitudes.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

Let’s lock implementation details so you can run cleanly and report defensibly this week.\n\nTwo quick checks before you run\n- Bootstrap design: prefer paired bootstrap over counties so comparisons (baseline vs population allocation; with vs without event_counties) preserve county identity. OK to use 1,000 resamples with a fixed seed?\n- Weighted sign accuracy: report both unweighted and weighted-by-2008-CO2 (weight each county’s correctness by its baseline share). Agreed?\n\nImplementation skeleton (drop-in)\n- Metrics\n  - Unweighted MAPE_pct = mean(abs(obs_pct_i − pred_pct_i))\n  - Weighted MAPE_pct = sum(w_i * abs(obs_pct_i − pred_pct_i)), w_i = CO2_2008_i / sum(CO2_2008)\n  - Sign accuracy (unweighted) = mean(sign(obs_pct_i) == sign(pred_state))\n  - Weighted sign accuracy = sum(w_i * 1[sign(obs_pct_i) == sign(pred_state)])\n- Paired bootstrap (1,000 reps, seed=123)\n  - For each b: sample indices with replacement from the clean county set; compute metric_b for baseline-share; compute metric_b for population allocation on the SAME resample; store differences Δ_b for ablation; CIs = percentiles 2.5/97.5.\n  - For event_county exclusion effect: compute metric_b on resample ∩ non-event counties; Δ_b = metric_b(non-event) − metric_b(all clean).\n- Outlier/event flags\n  - resid_i = obs_pct_i − pred_state; outlier if |resid_i| ≥ 0.20 OR among top-5 |resid|.\n  - event_county = outlier OR (plant retirement/mothball 2008–2011) OR (Δcapacity ≥ 50 MW) OR (Δgen ≤ −40% at a coal/gas unit).\n- Figures\n  - Calibration: x = pred_state (constant), y = obs_pct_i; size ∝ CO2_2008_i; color = event_county; annotate MAPE (weighted/unweighted), sign accuracy (weighted/unweighted) with bootstrap 95% CIs.\n  - Choropleth: absolute percent error by county; outline event_counties.\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (updated with weighting and CIs)\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Hypothesis: EPS with a $3–$5/t carbon price (2009 start) predicts 2008→2011 county power CO2 with weighted MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% weighted sign accuracy on the clean set.\n- Minimal test: One EPS run to get pred_state; exclude counties <10,000 t in 2008; compute weighted/unweighted metrics with 1,000 paired bootstraps for CIs; produce calibration and choropleth.\n- Falsifier: Weighted MAPE > 30% or weighted sign accuracy < 60%.\n- Interpretation: If falsified, record ±$2/t sensitivity; note whether errors concentrate in event_counties.\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation\n- Hypothesis: Baseline-share allocation outperforms population-weighted by ≥5 percentage points in weighted MAPE.\n- Minimal test: Hold pred_state fixed; compute weighted MAPE for baseline vs population; paired bootstrap ΔMAPE CIs; report unweighted as secondary.\n- Falsifier: ΔMAPE CI includes 0 and point estimate < 2 pp (allocation second-order). If so, prefer population weighting for simplicity and document.\n\n3) Event-county exclusion robustness\n- Hypothesis: Excluding event_counties improves weighted MAPE by ≥10 pp without materially changing weighted sign accuracy.\n- Minimal test: Compute metrics on clean vs clean-minus-event sets; paired bootstrap Δs; show both series on calibration plot.\n- Interpretation: If Δ small, errors likely from statewide intensity mismatch or mapping; note in limitations.\n\nSummary table (memo-ready)\n- Rows: Clean; Clean − event; Population allocation (clean); Population allocation (clean − event).\n- Columns: N counties; Weighted MAPE (95% CI); Unweighted MAPE (95% CI); Weighted sign accuracy (95% CI); Unweighted sign accuracy (95% CI); ΔMAPE vs baseline (if applicable).\n\nPrediction log template (top of notebook)\n- Columns: Date | Scenario (price path, allocation, inclusion rule) | Prior MAPE/sign | Observed MAPE/sign (weighted) | 1–2 sentence rationale/outcome.\n\nMemo methods paragraph (paste/edit)\n- “We simulate New York’s 2009 RGGI carbon price using the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS), exporting the state-level power-sector CO2 percent change for 2011 vs. 2008. We map this predicted percent change uniformly to counties proportional to their 2008 power CO2 (‘baseline-share’). The clean county set excludes counties with 2008 CO2 < 10,000 t. We evaluate county-level performance using weighted MAPE (weights = 2008 CO2 share) and weighted sign accuracy, with 1,000 paired bootstrap resamples to form 95% CIs. Robustness includes (i) a population-weighted allocation ablation and (ii) exclusion of counties flagged as event_counties via residual/outlier rules and public plant event data.”\n\nNext actions (2 hours)\n- Implement paired bootstrap and produce the summary table and two figures.\n- Email the event_counties list to your NYSERDA contact for quick confirmation.\n- Paste the table/figures here; I’ll help tighten the caption and discussion.\n\nIntuition\n- Weighting focuses evaluation on where emissions actually are, and paired bootstraps let you compare mappings apples-to-apples. If a few plant events drive most error, excluding them should sharply improve fit, revealing whether the simulator’s statewide signal is broadly right.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Pre-specifying thresholds, weighting by exposure, and using paired resampling for ablations are standard empirical hygiene steps that reduce small-sample artifacts and overinterpretation. Grounding the scenario in an established simulator and citing known RGGI magnitudes keeps claims calibrated and policy-relevant.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

      "student_message": "This is incredibly helpful and detailed! Thank you for breaking down the notebook skeleton and the three experiments so clearly. It makes the next steps feel much more manageable.\n\nTo answer your strategic questions:\n\n- **Metric weighting:** I agree, let's report both weighted by 2008 CO2 and unweighted, and lead with the weighted results. That makes a lot of sense to avoid small counties skewing things.\n- **Confidence intervals:** Yes, bootstrap CIs with 1,000 resamples sound perfect for MAPE and sign accuracy. That will give us a good sense of robustness.\n- **Visualization:** For the calibration scatter, I like the idea of bubble size proportional to 2008 CO2 and color to mark event_counties. It adds a lot of visual information.\n- **Output cadence:** I'll keep the prediction log at the top of the notebook as a markdown table for now. It feels easier to track and share that way initially.",

Using level changes for the scatter surfaces scale and outliers that percent-change plots can hide.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- You’re making pre-registered, falsifiable claims, controlling small-sample noise via paired resampling, and isolating mapping vs. event-driven errors—standard empirical hygiene and scenario-analysis transparency. Anchoring the policy lever to EPS and contextualizing magnitudes with established RGGI evidence keeps the memo calibrated and credible.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

      "student_message": "This is incredibly detailed, thank you for clarifying the bootstrap design and the weighted sign accuracy. 1,000 resamples with a fixed seed sounds perfect. And yes, reporting both unweighted and weighted-by-2008-CO2 for sign accuracy is a great idea. I've got the implementation skeleton and the three experiments laid out clearly.  I'll focus on getting the paired bootstrap and the figures generated this week.  The memo methods paragraph is also super helpful for framing the work.  I'll email my NYSERDA contact about the event counties list right away.  Really appreciate you walking me through this!",

Locking a few final details will maximize clarity and reproducibility.\n\nStrategic checks\n- Reproducibility: will you log EPS version/hash, the exact price path ($3/2009, $4/2010, $5/2011), and export the raw EPS outputs to a CSV for the repo?\n- Population-ablation math: confirm you’ll redistribute the 2011 state total to counties by population shares, then convert to percent change, so county predictions differ across counties (not a constant percent).\n- Diagnostics: do you want to report bias alongside MAPE (mean signed error in percent) and a simple regression of observed ΔCO2 on predicted ΔCO2 to check slope/intercept?\n- Event-county disclosure: okay to list event_counties in an appendix table with the outlier rule and any NYSERDA confirmations?\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (final, concise)\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Hypothesis: With EPS carbon price path $3→$4→$5/t (2009–2011), weighted MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% weighted sign accuracy for 2008→2011 county power CO2 on the clean set.\n- Setup: EPS state-level percent change (2011 vs 2008); exclude counties <10,000 t (2008); compute weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy with 1,000 paired bootstraps; figures: level-change calibration scatter and error choropleth.\n- Falsifier: Weighted MAPE > 30% or weighted sign accuracy < 60%.\n- Interpretation: If falsified, run ±$2/t sensitivity and diagnose whether errors cluster in event_counties.\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation\n- Hypothesis: Baseline-share allocation outperforms population-weighted by ≥5 pp in weighted MAPE on the clean set.\n- Setup: Hold the same EPS state total; reallocate 2011 state total to counties by population shares; convert to percent change; paired bootstrap ΔMAPE and Δ sign accuracy.\n- Falsifier: ΔMAPE CI includes 0 and point estimate < 2 pp.\n- Interpretation: If small, allocation is second-order—prefer population for simplicity and transparency, document the result.\n\n3) Event-county exclusion robustness\n- Hypothesis: Excluding event_counties improves weighted MAPE by ≥10 pp without materially changing weighted sign accuracy.\n- Setup: event_county = residual outliers (≥20 pp or top-5 |resid|) OR plant events (retirement/mothball 2008–2011, Δcapacity ≥ 50 MW, Δgen ≤ −40%); compute metrics with vs. without; paired bootstrap CIs.\n- Falsifier: ΔMAPE small (<3–5 pp) with overlapping CIs.\n- Interpretation: If minimal change, errors likely from statewide intensity mismatch or mapping assumptions—note in limitations.\n\nNear-term deliverables (Phase 0 gate)\n- Summary table: N counties; weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy (95% CIs); ΔMAPE for allocation; metrics with vs. without event_counties.\n- Figures: level-change calibration scatter (bubble size by 2008 CO2; color = event_county), error choropleth with event_county outlines.\n- Prediction log: ≥7 entries this week (target ≥14 over two weeks), including priors and outcomes for $3/$4/$5 and ±$2/t sensitivity, allocation ablation, and event-county exclusion.\n- Methods note: EPS version, price path, exclusion rule, event_county criteria, bootstrap seed/B.\n\nMemo anchors\n- Use the EPS documentation for lever settings and model mapping of carbon price to emissions; cite in Methods.

Let’s lock a clear “definition of done” for this week and a couple of high-impact checks that will make the memo write itself.\n\nStrategic questions\n- Statewide calibration: will you also compare EPS’s 2011 vs 2008 state total percent change to the observed state total to separate statewide miss vs allocation miss?\n- Regression spec: for the level-change diagnostic, do you want both (i) constrained slope-only regression (through origin) and (ii) unconstrained with intercept, and to report slope CIs?\n- Event-county appendix: will you include the residual threshold, plant-event criteria, and any NYSERDA confirmations as columns in the table so exclusions are auditable?\n- Repro bundle: will you save a “frozen” CSV (clean county set, event flags, obs/pred deltas, weights) to avoid accidental drift across re-runs?\n\nThis week’s “definition of done” (Phase 0 gate)\n- Summary table: N counties; weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy (95% paired bootstrap CIs); ΔMAPE for allocation; metrics with vs without event_counties.\n- Figures: level-change calibration scatter (bubble size = 2008 CO2, color = event_county); error choropleth with event_county outlines.\n- Diagnostics: mean signed percent error (bias); regression of observed ΔCO2 on predicted ΔCO2 (slope-only and with intercept, 95% CI); statewide percent change EPS vs observed.\n- Methods block + repro assets: EPS version/hash, price path ($3→$4→$5/t in 2009–2011), exclusion rule (<10,000 t), event_county criteria, bootstrap seed/B=123/1000, and export of raw EPS outputs + frozen analysis CSV.\n- Prediction log: ≥7 entries (priors and outcomes for $3/$4/$5, ±$2/t sensitivity, allocation ablation, event exclusion).\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (final confirmation)\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Hypothesis: With EPS $3→$4→$5/t (2009–2011), weighted MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% weighted sign accuracy for 2008→2011 at the county level on the clean set.\n- Minimal test: Exclude <10,000 t counties; compute weighted/unweighted metrics with 1,000 paired bootstraps; level-Δ calibration scatter; bias and regression diagnostics.\n- Falsifier: Weighted MAPE > 30% or weighted sign accuracy < 60%. Follow-up: ±$2/t sensitivity and note clustering in event_counties.\n\n2) Allocation-method ablation\n- Hypothesis: Baseline-share beats population-weighted by ≥5 pp in weighted MAPE.\n- Minimal test: Hold the same state 2011 total; redistribute by population shares; convert to percent; paired bootstrap ΔMAPE and Δ sign accuracy; report both with/without event_counties.\n- Falsifier: ΔMAPE CI includes 0 and point estimate < 2 pp. Interpretation: allocation is second-order; prefer population for simplicity and document.\n\n3) Event-county exclusion robustness\n- Hypothesis: Excluding event_counties improves weighted MAPE by ≥10 pp without materially changing weighted sign accuracy.\n- Minimal test: event_county = residual outliers (≥20 pp or top-5 |resid|) OR plant events (retire/mothball 2008–2011, Δcapacity ≥ 50 MW, Δgen ≤ −40%); paired bootstrap Δs.\n- Falsifier: ΔMAPE small (<3–5 pp) with overlapping CIs. Interpretation: errors stem from statewide intensity mismatch or mapping, not discrete events.\n\nNext actions (today, 2–3 hours)\n- Run EPS and export 2011 vs 2008 percent change; freeze the clean county set and event flags; generate figures and the summary table.\n- Add regression and bias diagnostics; add a one-line statewide comparison (EPS vs observed).\n- Email NYSERDA the event_counties list; record confirmations in the appendix table.\n\nIntuition\n- Most spatial error arises from a few discrete unit events or tiny baselines. Weighting by exposure and triaging events isolates the statewide carbon-price signal. Regression and bias checks tell you whether the mechanism is right in magnitude (slope) and level (intercept).\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Pre-registered thresholds, exposure-weighted metrics, and paired bootstraps enable apples-to-apples ablations with uncertainty. Statewide vs county diagnostics decompose model vs allocation error, and transparent event exclusions with public sources keep the analysis auditable and policy-relevant.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

For the population-ablation math, I'll make sure to redistribute the 2011 state total by population shares first, then convert to percent change – that makes sense for county-level variation. I'll also report bias alongside MAPE and the regression diagnostics. It's okay to list event_counties in an appendix with the outlier rule and NYSERDA confirmations. The three experiments look solid and the hypotheses are well-defined. I'm excited to get these running!",

Let’s tighten a few final choices and hand you memo-ready templates so you can drop in results as they come.\n\nStrategic questions\n- Regression weighting: OLS or weight by 2008 CO2 for slope/intercept? I recommend reporting both and leading with CO2-weighted to reflect exposure.\n- Sensitivity sets: will you hold the exact clean-county set fixed across price sensitivities and ablations to ensure apples-to-apples comparisons?\n- Rounding/units: okay to standardize all percent changes to percentage points (pp) with one decimal in the memo?\n\nActionable checklist (quick to implement)\n- Statewide calibration: compute EPS vs observed state total Δ% (2011 vs 2008). Report bias = observed − EPS in pp.\n- Regressions (level Δ): run y = observed ΔCO2_i, x = predicted ΔCO2_i.\n  - Slope-only (through origin), then full y = α + βx. Provide β with 95% CI for both; optionally CO2-weighted fits.\n  - Quick code: use HC3 robust SEs; check leverage; don’t remove points—just note event_counties.\n- Frozen analysis CSV: fips, co2_2008, co2_2011, obs_pct, pred_pct_base, pred_pct_pop, obs_delta, pred_delta_base, pred_delta_pop, weight_co2, event_county, outlier_rule, plant_event, region.\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (final confirmation)\n1) Core backtest: NY RGGI 2009\n- Hypothesis: With EPS $3→$4→$5/t (2009–2011), weighted MAPE ≤ 30% and ≥70% weighted sign accuracy.\n- Minimal test: Exclude <10,000 t; compute weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy with 1,000 paired bootstraps; level-Δ calibration scatter; bias and regression diagnostics; statewide Δ%.\n- Falsifier: Weighted MAPE > 30% or weighted sign accuracy < 60%.

Let’s lock QA guardrails, set the Phase 0 gate, and add three quick, falsifiable add-on checks that will make your results robust and memo-ready.\n\nStrategic questions\n- Data sources: which population source/year will you use for the allocation ablation (e.g., ACS 2008/2010), and will you document it in Methods?\n- Bootstrap convergence: do you want to sanity-check B by running B=500 and B=1500 once to verify CI stability (expected change ≤1–2 pp)?\n- Threshold sensitivity: will you run a quick sensitivity on the 10,000 t exclusion (e.g., 5,000 and 20,000 t) and record whether weighted metrics move materially?\n\nQA checklist (fast, high impact)\n- Reconciliation: sum of county CO2 equals state total in 2008 and 2011; flag any FIPS mismatches.\n- Units/scope: confirm CO2 (not CO2e) and consistent power-sector definition in both years; document any exclusions.\n- Statewide vs county: compute observed state Δ% and compare to EPS; report bias in pp.\n- Fixed sets: freeze the clean-county set and event flags; reuse across all sensitivities/ablations.\n- Bootstrap: paired resampling across all variants; fixed seed; optional convergence check.\n- Regressions: report OLS and CO2-weighted slopes with HC3 SEs; slope-only and with intercept; do not delete outliers—just mark event_counties.\n\nPhase 0 gate (definition of done for this week)\n- Summary table with weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy (95% paired bootstrap CIs), ΔMAPE for allocation, with/without event_counties, plus statewide EPS vs observed Δ%.\n- Figures: level-change calibration scatter (size = 2008 CO2, color = event_county) and error choropleth with event_county outlines.\n- Diagnostics: bias (mean signed percent error), two regressions with 95% CIs, leverage check.\n- Repro bundle: EPS version/hash and price path ($3/$4/$5 in 2009–2011), raw EPS exports, frozen CSV (clean set + flags + obs/pred deltas + weights), event appendix with criteria and NYSERDA confirmations.\n- Prediction log: ≥7 entries this week.\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable add-on experiments (compact and fast)\n1) Placebo pre-period check (2006→2008)\n- Hypothesis: With no carbon price (p=0), county-level sign accuracy ≈50% and weighted MAPE not better than the post period.\n- Setup: Build 2006 and 2008 county CO2; set pred_pct=0 for all counties; compute weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy with 1,000 paired bootstraps.\n- Success/falsifier: If placebo “beats” the true post period (lower MAPE, higher sign), revisit mapping/measurement error; otherwise, treat as a sanity check that you’re not overfitting noise.\n- Interpretation: Confirms the post-period fit is not an artifact of volatility.\n\n2) Exclusion-threshold sensitivity\n- Hypothesis: Weighted metrics are stable (≤2–3 pp change) when varying the exclusion threshold from 10,000 t to 5,000 t and 20,000 t.\n- Setup: Re-run the core backtest on three clean sets; compute weighted metrics and CIs; keep event_county rule unchanged.\n- Success/falsifier: Large swings imply instability from small baselines; if observed, document and keep the 10,000 t main spec while flagging small-county volatility as a limitation.\n- Interpretation: Validates robustness of your inclusion rule.\n\n3) One-year-ahead robustness (2012 vs 2008)\n- Hypothesis: EPS-calibrated 2012 vs 2008 statewide percent change achieves similar weighted MAPE/sign accuracy as 2011 vs 2008.\n- Setup: Export EPS 2012 state Δ%; recompute county predictions and metrics (same clean set and flags).\n- Success/falsifier: If performance collapses in 2012 (e.g., weighted MAPE worsens by ≥10 pp), note potential year-specific shocks or price path misalignment; otherwise, cite temporal robustness.\n\nNext actions (today, 2 hours)\n- Finish EPS run, export raw outputs, freeze the CSV, and compute statewide Δ% vs observed.\n- Run core metrics with paired bootstraps and generate both figures; add bias and regression diagnostics.\n- Send event_counties and criteria to NYSERDA; log any confirmations immediately in the appendix table.\n\nIntuition\n- A small set of discrete plant events and tiny baselines drive most spatial error. Exposure-weighted evaluation, fixed datasets across variants, and placebo/threshold/time-window checks isolate whether your mechanism (statewide price signal) works apart from local shocks and sample quirks.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- These steps align with empirical hygiene: pre-registered thresholds, exposure weighting, paired resampling for ablations, and orthogonal robustness checks to guard against overfitting and researcher degrees of freedom. Anchoring to an established simulator and comparing to known RGGI magnitudes keeps claims calibrated and auditable.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- Murray, B.

Let’s lock a couple final choices and give you compact experiment cards you can run and drop straight into the memo.\n\nStrategic questions\n- FIPS and boundaries: will you verify ACS 2010 population aligns 1:1 with your 2008/2011 county FIPS (no discontinued/split counties) and document any crosswalks?\n- Directional accuracy deadband: do you want a small tie-band around zero (e.g., |obs_pct| ≤ 2 pp → “no change”) so sign accuracy isn’t dominated by noise near zero? If yes, pre-register it and apply consistently.\n- Missing/zero baselines: how will you treat counties with very small denominators that slip past the 10,000 t cut but yield extreme percent changes? Consider capping |obs_pct| at 200% in diagnostics only, not in metric computation, and flagging those counties in the appendix.\n\nThree concrete, falsifiable experiments (ready-to-run)\n1) Placebo pre-period (2006→2008)\n- Objective: Ensure the framework doesn’t “find signal” when there should be none. Hypothesis: With p=0, weighted sign accuracy ≈50% and weighted MAPE not better than the 2008→2011 backtest. \n- Setup: Build county CO2 for 2006 and 2008; set pred_pct=0; compute weighted/unweighted MAPE and sign accuracy with 1,000 paired bootstraps on the same clean set and flags.\n- Metrics and expected results: Weighted MAPE comparable to or worse than the post period; sign accuracy near chance. \n- Interpretation: If placebo beats the real backtest, revisit mapping/measurement error. If it underperforms, treat as a passed sanity check.\n- Follow-ups: Repeat with 2007→2008 to confirm stability.\n\n2) Exclusion-threshold sensitivity (5,000 t vs 10,000 t vs 20,000 t)\n- Objective: Test robustness to inclusion rules. Hypothesis: Weighted metrics move by ≤2–3 pp across thresholds.\n- Setup: Recompute metrics and CIs for each threshold; keep event flags and allocation rules fixed; reuse paired bootstrap draws for apples-to-apples comparisons.\n- Metrics and expected results: Minimal movement in weighted MAPE/sign accuracy; larger movement in unweighted metrics is acceptable due to small-county noise.\n- Interpretation: Large swings imply instability from tiny baselines; keep 10,000 t as the main spec and report sensitivity as a limitation if needed.\n- Follow-ups: Add a “top-N CO2 counties only” check (e.g., top 80% by 2008 CO2).\n\n3) One-year-ahead robustness (2012 vs 2008)\n- Objective: Check temporal stability of the EPS signal. Hypothesis: Weighted MAPE and sign accuracy for 2012 vs 2008 are similar to 2011 vs 2008.\n- Setup: Export EPS 2012 percent change; hold the clean set and event flags fixed; compute metrics and 1,000 paired bootstraps; regenerate the level-Δ scatter.\n- Metrics and expected results: ≤5–7 pp difference in weighted MAPE; sign accuracy within ~5 pp of the 2011 result.\n- Interpretation: If performance collapses, document likely year-specific shocks or price-path mismatch; if stable, cite as evidence of generality.\n- Follow-ups: Repeat with 2010 vs 2008 for symmetry.\n\nQA quick hits (to finish Phase 0 cleanly)\n- Reconcile county sums to state totals in 2008 and 2011; flag any mismatches.\n- Preserve the state 2011 total in both baseline-share and population allocations; verify with a unit test.\n- Report OLS and CO2-weighted regressions (slope-only and with intercept) with HC3 SEs; mark event_counties but do not exclude them from the fit.\n- Run bootstrap convergence once at B=500 and B=1500; note any CI shifts >2 pp.\n\nNext actions (today)\n- Finish EPS run, export raw outputs, and write the frozen CSV (clean set, flags, obs/pred deltas, weights).\n- Compute core metrics with paired bootstraps; generate the two figures and the statewide vs observed comparison.\n- Kick off the three add-on experiments; post summary numbers and CIs for each.\n\nIntuition\n- The statewide carbon-price signal should manifest as proportional level changes across high-emitting counties; most deviations come from discrete plant shocks and tiny baselines. By weighting, fixing datasets across variants, and adding placebo/threshold/time-window checks, you separate genuine policy signal from sampling artifacts.\n\nWhy this is principled\n- Exposure-weighted metrics, paired resampling, and transparent sensitivity/placebo tests are standard empirical hygiene that reduce researcher degrees of freedom and overfitting. Grounding the scenario in a documented simulator and referencing the RGGI price path keeps magnitudes calibrated and claims auditable.\n\nCitations\n- U.S. Energy Policy Simulator Documentation — https://docs.energypolicy.solutions/models/us\n- RGGI Auction Results (historical clearing prices) — https://www.rggi.org/auctions/auction-results",

I'll plan to do that.\n- For threshold sensitivity, I'll run quick checks on 5,000 t and 20,000 t exclusions and record any material movement in the weighted metrics.\n\nI'm also excited about the three add-on experiments – they seem like perfect, fast ways to build confidence in the results.
