The user wants a research plan for multimodal misinformation detection in low-bandwidth regions. Key constraints: resource-constrained, low-bandwidth. This is a specific technical problem, not a vague question, so I can give a focused response.

My honest assessment: This is a promising area because most existing multimodal models assume high-bandwidth, cloud-based inference. The core challenge is making detection work on-device or with minimal data transfer.

What they need to hear: Focus on the bandwidth constraint first, then build detection around it. Don't start with a fancy model that won't deploy.

Plan structure:
1. Lead with assessment
2. Core technical approach (lightweight model + selective downloading)
3. Evaluation strategy that reflects real constraints
4. What to avoid

Keep it under 300 words, focused, no lists of 5+ items.

This is a strong research direction because it addresses a real deployment gap—most multimodal misinformation work assumes u...
