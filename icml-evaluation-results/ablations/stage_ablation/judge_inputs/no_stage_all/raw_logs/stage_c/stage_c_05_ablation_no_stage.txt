The user wants help planning AI research but doesn't know Python. This is a fundamental constraint that will severely limit their options. I need to be direct about this limitation while still being helpful. My honest assessment is that not knowing Python is a major blocker for most modern AI research, but there might be some narrow paths forward. I should explain why this is a problem and suggest concrete alternatives, including learning Python or focusing on areas where it's less critical.

Not knowing Python is a major blocker for nearly all modern AI research. Most frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, Hugging Face), datasets, and reproducible baselines are Python-based. You'd be trying to compete with one hand tied behind your back.

**Your realistic options:**

1. **Learn Python first** - This is the most honest advice. Spend 2-3 months on Python basics + PyTorch tutorials. It's a better time investment than trying to work around it.

2. **Focus on theoretical work** -...
