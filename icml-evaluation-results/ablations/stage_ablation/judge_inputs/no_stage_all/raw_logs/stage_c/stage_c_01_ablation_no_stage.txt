The user wants a research plan for GNNs for sea ice. This is a specific technical request, so I should give a focused, critical assessment and concrete direction. I need to:

1. Assess what's missing: They haven't specified the task (prediction? classification?), data type (satellite images? time series?), or what makes this novel.
2. Give my honest take: This is too vague to be a research plan. It's just a topic pairing.
3. Explain why: Without specifics, I can't evaluate feasibility, novelty, or impact.
4. Offer a path forward: Give them the key questions they need to answer to turn this into a real plan.

I should be direct and not soften the criticism. The plan needs to be testable and novel.

This isn't a research plan—it's just a topic. I can't evaluate it without specifics.

**What's missing:**
- **Task**: Are you predicting sea ice concentration, thickness, edge location, or something else?
- **Data**: Satellite imagery? Buoy measurements? What resolution...
