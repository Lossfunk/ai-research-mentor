The user wants a final submission checklist for a privacy-preserving NLP paper. They specifically mention:
- Artifact requirements
- Ethics statements
- Timeline checkpoints
- Deadline in six weeks

This is a practical, specific request. I should give them a focused checklist that covers these areas without being overly verbose. I need to be direct about what's critical and what can be skipped.

Key things to include:
1. Immediate actions (week 1-2)

4. Ethics documentation
5. Final polish items
6. Submission logistics
