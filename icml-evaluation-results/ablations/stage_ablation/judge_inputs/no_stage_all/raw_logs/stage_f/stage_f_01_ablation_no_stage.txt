The user wants venue recommendations for a 6-month compressible LLMs project plus a simulated reviewer summary. I need to:
1. Assess what makes sense for a 6-month project scope
2. Recommend appropriate venues with ethics/formatting constraints
3. Write a brief, realistic reviewer summary

For a 6-month project, this is likely a focused contribution (not a massive system). Top-tier venues like NeurIPS/ICLR might be too ambitious unless the results are truly breakthrough. More realistic targets would be workshops or second-tier conferences where focused work is valued.

Let me think about venues:
- Workshops at major conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) - good for early work
- EMNLP Findings - solid NLP venue, accepts shorter contributions
- COLM - new venue, might be good fit
- MLSys - if there's systems angle
- arXiv + blog post - always an option

Ethics constraints: need to mention model size, energy, reproducibility
Formatting: page limits, anonymity, code submission
