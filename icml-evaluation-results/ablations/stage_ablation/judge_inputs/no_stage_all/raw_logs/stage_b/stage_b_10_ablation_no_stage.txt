The user is asking about running self-supervised learning on hospital shift notes. This is a specific technical question with ethical implications. I need to:

1. Assess the idea honestly - is it promising or problematic?
2. Check for prior work (should use search tool)
3. Evaluate ethical risks directly
4. Give clear direction

Let me search for prior work first, then structure my response.

This is a high-risk idea that needs serious scrutiny before you touch any data.

**Prior work exists and it's sobering.** Self-supervised learning on clinical notes is well-studied (e.g., ClinicalBERT, GatorTron, NYUTron), but these models were trained on *de-identified* notes with IRB approval and institutional resources you likely don't have. The technical novelty is minimal unless you have a specific angle.

**The ethical risks are severe and immediate:**
- **HIPAA violation**: Shift notes contain PHI (names, dates, MRN). Even "anonymized" notes often fail re-identificati...
