The user is asking about novelty of using graph nets for sea-ice forecasting. I need to:
1. Give my honest assessment of novelty
2. Check if this has been done before (requires search)
3. Explain why it might or might not be novel
4. Give direction on what to do next

Let me search for existing work on graph neural networks and sea ice forecasting.

This is likely not novel. Graph neural networks have been applied to sea-ice forecasting since at least 2021-2022, with several papers using GNNs, message passing, and graph transformers for Arctic sea ice prediction.

The key issue isn't whether *anyone* has used graph nets—it's whether *your specific formulation* adds something new. Most existing work uses grid graphs or hand-crafted spatial neighborhoods. If you're just swapping a CNN for a GNN in a standard setup, that's incremental.

**What would actually be novel:**
- Graph structure that captures meaningful physical relationships (e.g., ice floe connectivity, o...
