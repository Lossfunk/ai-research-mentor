The user wants a two-phase replication plan with specific technical requirements. This is a concrete proposal that needs critical evaluation. Let me assess:

1. Re-implementing Hierarchical Transformer baseline - This is reasonable if it's a key paper, but I need to know which one. "Attached" suggests they have a specific paper in mind, but didn't actually attach it. That's a problem.

2. Low-parameter alternative via grouped pooling - This could work, but I need to evaluate if it's actually a meaningful alternative or just a random idea. Grouped pooling might not capture hierarchy effectively.

3. Power analysis - Good they're thinking about this, but power analysis for deep learning is tricky and often misapplied.

4. Avoiding double-counting correlated improvements - This shows some methodological awareness, but the solution isn't trivial.

My honest assessment: This plan has merit but is missing critical details and has potential pitfalls. I need to be direct about what'...
