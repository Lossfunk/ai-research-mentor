The user wants to reproduce a Hierarchical Transformer paper's training and evaluation pipeline. They want:
1. Key components (data preprocessing, hierarchical blocks, training schedule)
2. Comparability requirements
3. Leakage risks between pretraining and evaluation

I need to be critical and direct. First, I should note that they haven't actually attached the paper, so I'm working blind. This is a problem - I can't give specific reproduction guidance without knowing which paper they're referring to. There are multiple hierarchical transformer papers (e.g., Hierarchical Transformer for Long Documents, HiT, etc.).

I should:
1. Lead with the critical assessment: can't help without the paper
2. Explain why this matters (different papers have different architectures)
3. Give them a framework for what to look for when they share the paper
4. Keep it concise and focused

I should NOT:
- Pretend I know which paper they mean
- Give generic advice that might be wrong
- Write a lon...
