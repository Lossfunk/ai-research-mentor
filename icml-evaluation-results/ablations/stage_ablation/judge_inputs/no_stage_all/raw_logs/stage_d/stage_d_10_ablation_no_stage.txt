The user wants to test how adding privacy/governance constraints (specifically offline inference) affects verification-like failure rates in a Hierarchical Transformer. They need baselines, datasets, and statistical tests.

Key points:
- Need to understand what "verification-like failure rates" means in this context
- Need to pick appropriate baselines (what are they comparing against?)
- Need datasets that can measure this
- Need statistical tests that are appropriate for the comparison

I should ask for clarification on what "verification-like failure rates" means and what the current setup is, since I don't have the attached model details. I also need to understand what their baseline is - are they comparing to the same model without constraints, or to other architectures?

This is a specific technical question but lacks context about the model and what verification failures look like. I should be direct about what's missing.

I need more context to give you u...
