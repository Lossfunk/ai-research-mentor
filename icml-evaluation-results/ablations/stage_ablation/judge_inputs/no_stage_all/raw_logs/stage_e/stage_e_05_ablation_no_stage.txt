The user wants help framing a response to reviewers who doubt domain transferability of PeerRead aspect score models. This is a specific, technical question about addressing reviewer concerns in NLP/ML research. I need to:

1. Lead with honest assessment: Is this a valid concern? Yes, domain transferability is a classic weakness in many NLP models.
2. Be specific about why reviewers doubt this - likely because PeerRead is academic papers, and they question if it works on other domains.
3. Give concrete experiments/ablations that would actually address this, not vague suggestions.

- Direct transfer to other domains (most convincing)
- Ablations showing what matters for transfer
- Analysis of failure modes
- Maybe controlled adaptation experiments

I should be critical but constructive - this is a solvable concern if they design the right experiments.
