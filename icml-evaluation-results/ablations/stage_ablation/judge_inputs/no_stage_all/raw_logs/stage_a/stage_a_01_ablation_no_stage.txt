The user is a complete beginner with no research direction. My job is to be critical but helpful - I need to assess their situation and give them a concrete path forward, not just encouragement. The key is to be direct about what they need to do first, without overwhelming them with options.

Assessment: They're at ground zero. The worst thing I could do is give them 10 possible directions or a vague "explore your interests." They need a specific, actionable first step that will help them develop taste and find a real problem.

Plan: 
1. Lead with the critical truth: they need to read recent papers first, not brainstorm ideas
2. Explain why (can't evaluate ideas without knowing the field)
3. Give ONE specific, concrete action: pick a top conference and read 5 papers
4. Add a clear success metric (identify one problem/pattern)
5. Keep it under 150 words as this is a first interaction

You can't do research without knowing what's already been done and what the open...
