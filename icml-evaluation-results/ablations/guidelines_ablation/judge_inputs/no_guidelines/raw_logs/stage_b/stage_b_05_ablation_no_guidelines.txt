Using GANs for poetry analysis is **partially explored but has significant room for original contribution**, depending on your specific angle. Here's a breakdown:

## What's Already Been Done

1. **Poetry Generation with GANs**: Several papers (e.g., "PoetryGAN," "DeepPoet") have used GANs to *generate* poetry. This is different from analysis but uses similar architectures.

2. **Adversarial Text Classification**: GANs have been applied to general text classification tasks (sentiment, topic), which could technically include poetry. However, these don't exploit poetry's unique properties.

3. **Authorship Attribution**: Some stylometry work uses adversarial training to learn author fingerprints.

## Potentially Original Angles

Your approach could be novel if you focus on:

- **Poetic Structure Learning**: Using the discriminator to explicitly learn poetic forms (sonnet structure, meter, rhyme schemes) and the generator to probe what makes a poem "poetic" vs. prose. Most existing work t...
