Using graph neural networks (GNNs) for sea-ice forecasting is a promising idea that sits at the intersection of two active research areas, but its novelty depends on the specifics of your approach. Here's a breakdown:

### Current Landscape

**ML for Sea Ice Forecasting:**
- **CNN-based methods** are well-established (e.g., using U-Net architectures for sea ice concentration prediction from satellite data)
- **Temporal models** (LSTMs, ConvLSTMs) are also common for forecasting
- Physics-informed neural networks are emerging

**GNNs in Climate/Weather:**
- GNNs are rapidly gaining traction in atmospheric forecasting (e.g., DeepMind's **GraphCast** for global weather prediction, which includes surface variables but isn't sea-ice focused)
- They've been applied to ocean modeling, regional climate downscaling, and general spatio-temporal forecasting
- The key advantage is handling irregular spatial structures and explicit relational modeling
