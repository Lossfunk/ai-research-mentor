Here are tiered venue recommendations for a 6-month compressible LLMs project, with key constraints and a simulated review:

---

### **Tier 1: High-Impact Main Conferences** (Best for strong, complete results)

**1. ICLR 2025 (International Conference on Learning Representations)**
- **Deadline**: ~October 2024 (6-month timeline fits perfectly)
- **Format**: 9 pages + unlimited references, double-blind, LaTeX template
- **Ethics**: Requires Ethics Statement (max 1 page) addressing environmental claims, reproducibility, and potential misuse of efficient models. Must report full compute budgets (training/inference) and carbon estimates using standard tools like ML CO2 Impact calculator.
- **Fit**: Excellent for novel compression algorithms with theoretical insights. Strong emphasis on open-source code.

**2. MLSys 2025 (Machine Learning and Systems)**
- **Deadline**: ~October 2024
- **Format**: 9 pages + references, single-blind, ACM template
- **Ethics**: Mandatory Artifact Evaluation....
