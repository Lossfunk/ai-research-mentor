For a language-model-for-law paper at major AI/NLP conferences, you must satisfy these **mandatory** ethics/compliance sections (check conference CFPs for exact requirements, as they evolve):

---

### **1. MANDATORY GENERAL SECTIONS**

- **Limitations Section** (required at ACL/EMNLP/NAACL): Explicitly discuss your model's failures, constraints, and what it *cannot* do. For legal LM: hallucination rates, jurisdiction specificity, domain coverage gaps.
