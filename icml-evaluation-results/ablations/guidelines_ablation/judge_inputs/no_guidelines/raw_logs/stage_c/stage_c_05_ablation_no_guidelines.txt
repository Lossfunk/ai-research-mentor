Great! Not knowing Python is a temporary obstacle, not a dealbreaker. Many successful AI researchers started without coding backgrounds. Here's a practical roadmap to plan your research while building necessary skills:

## Phase 1: Plan Your Research (No Python Needed)

**Start with these foundational steps:**

1. **Define your research question** - What specific problem are you solving? The more precise, the better. Write it in plain English.

2. **Literature review** - Use Google Scholar, arXiv, and conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR). Focus on understanding *what* was done and *why*, not the code details. Tools like Elicit or Connected Papers can help.

3. **Identify your data** - Where will it come from? Is it public? Do you need to collect it? What format is it in? Document this thoroughly.

4. **Choose your methodology** - Will you:
   - Apply existing models to a new domain?
   - Compare different approaches?
   - Develop a new theoretical framework?
   - Focus on AI et...
