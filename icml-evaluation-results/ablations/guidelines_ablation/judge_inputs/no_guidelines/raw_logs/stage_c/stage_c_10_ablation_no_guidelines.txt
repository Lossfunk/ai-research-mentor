# Resource-Constrained Research Plan: Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Low-Bandwidth Regions

## 1. Problem Scoping & Requirements Analysis (Months 1-3)

**Core Research Questions:**
- What misinformation modalities are most prevalent in low-bandwidth contexts?
- What is the minimum viable data requirement for effective detection?
- How do bandwidth limitations (e.g., 2G/3G, data caps, intermittent connectivity) affect real-time detection feasibility?

**Resource-Constrained Methods:**
- **Partner with 2-3 local NGOs** in target regions for community-based needs assessment rather than large-scale surveys
- **Conduct bandwidth mapping** using tools like Facebook's OpenCellular or open-source bandwidth test data to quantify constraints
- **Analyze existing platform data** (with permission) from lightweight apps already used in these regions (e.g., SMS-based services, WhatsApp Business API logs)
- **Deliverable:** Prioritized list of misinformation types and modality combinations (l...
