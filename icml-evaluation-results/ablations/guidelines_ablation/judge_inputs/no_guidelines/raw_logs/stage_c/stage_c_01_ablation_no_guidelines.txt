# Research Plan: Graph Neural Networks for Sea Ice Modeling and Prediction

## 1. Project Overview & Motivation

**Goal**: Develop physically-constrained Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures to advance sea ice prediction, classification, and emulation capabilities beyond traditional deep learning methods.

**Rationale**: Sea ice exhibits complex spatiotemporal dependencies, non-local interactions, and topological changes (fracturing, melting) that grid-based CNNs struggle to capture. GNNs offer a natural framework for modeling sea ice as interconnected nodes with explicit spatial relationships and dynamic graph structures.

## 2. Research Questions & Objectives

### Core Research Questions:
1. How can we optimally represent sea ice data as dynamic graphs that capture both local and long-range spatial dependencies?
2. Which GNN architectures best balance predictive accuracy with physical consistency for sea ice variables?
3. Can GNNs emulate sea ice thermodynamic models with re...
