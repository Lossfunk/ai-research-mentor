I don't see any attached paper in our conversation. Could you please share the specific Hierarchical Transformer paper you're referring to? Once you provide it, I can give you a precise breakdown of its training and evaluation pipeline.

In the meantime, here's a general framework for reproducing hierarchical transformer pipelines that you can use as a checklist when reviewing the paper:

## Key Components to Identify

**1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Hierarchical structure**: How is raw data segmented into hierarchy levels (e.g., documents → paragraphs → sentences → tokens)?
- **Segmentation strategy**: Fixed-size chunks vs. semantic boundaries?
- **Position encoding**: How are hierarchical positions encoded (absolute, relative, rotary)?
- **Special tokens**: Hierarchy-level separators or CLS tokens
- **Tokenization**: WordPiece, BPE, or SentencePiece parameters

**2. Hierarchical Blocks Architecture**
- **Attention patterns**: Which levels use self-attention vs. cross-attention?
- **Inf...
