# Experimental Design: Testing Offline Inference Impact on Verification Failures

I'll design a comprehensive test framework since the attachment isn't visible. This assumes a standard **Hierarchical Transformer** (e.g., processing document → paragraph → token levels).

## 1. Model Variants & Baselines

**Test Condition**: Offline inference (no external API/database calls during inference)

**Baselines to compare against**:
- **Online (unconstrained)**: Model can retrieve from Wikipedia, search APIs, or knowledge bases
- **Offline (constrained)**: Same trained model, but retrieval modules disabled
- **Ablation**: Non-hierarchical transformer (standard BERT/GPT) to isolate architecture effects

## 2. Datasets for Verification Tasks

Choose datasets where external knowledge is **helpful but not strictly necessary**:

| Dataset | Task | Why It Matters for Offline |
|---------|------|---------------------------|
| **FEVER** | Fact verification | Requires Wikipedia evidence; offline model m...
