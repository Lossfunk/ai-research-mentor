Starting research in AI can feel overwhelming, but here's a practical roadmap to help you begin:

## 1. Build Strong Foundations
**Math**: You'll need:
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Calculus (derivatives, gradients)
- Probability & statistics
- Optimization basics

**Programming**: Python is essential. Get comfortable with:
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Git/GitHub

**Core ML Knowledge**:
- Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course (Coursera)
- Work through "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (free online)
- Complete Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning course

## 2. Explore the Field
AI is broad. Read about different subfields:
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, computer vision, NLP
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learning through interaction
- **Robotics**: Physical AI systems
- **AI Safety & Alignment**: Making AI systems robust and beneficial
- **Neurosymbolic AI**: Combining neural and symbolic approaches
