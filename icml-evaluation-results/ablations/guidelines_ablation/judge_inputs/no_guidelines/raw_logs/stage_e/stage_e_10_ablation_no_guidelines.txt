A legitimate concern raised by reviewers is whether our findings, derived primarily from English-language experiments, will generalize to multilingual settings—a skepticism we share given known cross-linguistic variations in syntactic structure and discourse patterns. To address this, we propose a three-phase extension: **Phase 1** will replicate our core experiments on five typologically diverse languages (Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, and Finnish) using UD-Parse and XL-Sum datasets, systematically varying morphological richness and word order flexibility. **Phase 2** introduces a controlled comparison across three resource levels: high (German), medium (Korean), and low (Swahili), leveraging the FLORES-200 evaluation suite to isolate data scarcity effects. **Phase 3** tests zero-shot transfer to 20 additional languages, measuring performance degradation via our proposed cross-lingual consistency metric (Δ-Score). We will release all multilingual checkpoints and a standardized eva...
