To address this, we propose a three-phase extension: **Phase 1** will replicate our core experiments on five typologically diverse languages (Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, and Finnish) using UD-Parse and XL-Sum datasets, systematically varying morphological richness and word order flexibility. **Phase 2** introduces a controlled comparison across three resource levels: high (German), medium (Korean), and low (Swahili), leveraging the FLORES-200 evaluation suite to isolate data scarcity effects. **Phase 3** tests zero-shot transfer to 20 additional languages, measuring performance degradation via our proposed cross-lingual consistency metric (\u0394-Score). We will release all multilingual checkpoints and a standardized eva...",

ICLR 2025 (International Conference on Learning Representations)**\n- **Deadline**: ~October 2024 (6-month timeline fits perfectly)\n- **Format**: 9 pages + unlimited references, double-blind, LaTeX template\n- **Ethics**: Requires Ethics Statement (max 1 page) addressing environmental claims, reproducibility, and potential misuse of efficient models. Must report full compute budgets (training/inference) and carbon estimates using standard tools like ML CO2 Impact calculator.\n- **Fit**: Excellent for novel compression algorithms with theoretical insights. Strong emphasis on open-source code.\n\n**2.
