  The user is asking me to help map venue-specific formatting and artifact expectations (pages, anonymization, code/data release) and adapt their plan. This is a research-related question about academic publication venues (conferences, journals) and their specific requirements.

Since the user hasn't provided:
1. Their current plan
2. The specific venue(s) they're targeting
3. Their field of research

I need to ask for these details to provide a helpful, tailored response. I should be clear about what information I need and why.

Let me structure my response to:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Explain what information I need to help effectively
3. Provide a general framework they can use in the meantime
4. Offer to do the detailed mapping once they provide specifics

I should be helpful and informative while being clear about my limitations without specific details.

I'd be happy to help you map venue-specific requirements and adapt your plan! To provide you with accurate, tailored guidance, I'll need a few key details:

## Information Needed

1. **Target venue(s)**: Which specific conference(s) or journal(s)? (e.g., "NeurIPS 2024", "ICML", "Nature Medicine", "ACL 2024")
2. **Your current plan**: What does your existing timeline/outline look like?
3. **Research area**: What's your field? (e.g., ML, NLP, systems, computational biology)
4. **Planned artifacts**: What are you planning to release? (code, data, models, etc.)

## General Framework (While You Gather Details)

Here's a template you can start with. Once you provide the specifics, I'll fill in the exact requirements:

| Requirement | Venue A | Venue B | Your Current Plan | Adaptation Needed |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Page Limit** | | | | |
| **Anonymization Period** | | | | |
| **Code Release** | | | | |
| **Data Release** | | | | |
| **Model Release** | | | | |
| **Supplementary Material** | | | | |
| **Ethics Statement** | | | | |
| **Reproducibility Checklist** | | | | |
| **Key Deadlines** | | | | |

## Common Patterns by Field

- **ML/AI conferences**: Typically 8-9 pages + references, strict anonymization, mandatory code release (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
- **Systems conferences**: Often 11-12 pages, less strict anonymization, emphasize artifact evaluation (SOSP, OSDI)
- **NLP conferences**: 8 pages + references, anonymization, data/code release encouraged (ACL, EMNLP)
- **Medical journals**: No page limits, no anonymization, strict data sharing policies, clinical trial registration

**Please share your venue list and current plan, and I'll create a detailed mapping with specific adaptations for your situation.**
