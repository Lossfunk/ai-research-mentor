  The user is asking about "compressible LLMs" - they want to know what the novelty is and what tests they should run. This seems like a research idea they're considering. I need to:

1. Clarify what "compressible LLMs" might mean
2. Discuss potential novelty - what's already been done in this space
3. Suggest concrete experiments/tests to run

Let me think about what "compressible LLMs" could refer to:
- Models that are inherently compressible (e.g., through sparsity, low-rank structure)
- Compression algorithms specifically designed for LLMs
- LLMs that can compress data (like a compressor)
- LLMs that can be heavily compressed without performance loss

The most likely interpretation is about model compression techniques for LLMs - making them smaller/faster while maintaining performance. This is a very active area of research.

Novelty aspects to consider:
- There's already a lot of work on quantization, pruning, distillation, low-rank factorization
- Recent work on sparse attention, mixture of experts (MoE), etc.
- The "compressibility" property itself might be interesting - which models compress better? Why?
- Maybe they mean something like "LLMs as compressors" - using LLMs for data compression, which connects to the minimum description length principle and recent work showing that scaling laws relate to compression

I should cover multiple interpretations to be helpful.

For tests/experiments, I should suggest:
- Standard compression techniques applied to various LLMs
- Measuring the trade-offs (size vs performance)
- Analyzing which architectural features lead to better compressibility
- Maybe some theoretical analysis

Let me structure my response:
1. Clarify the concept/interpretations
2. Discuss novelty (what's been done, what gaps might exist)
3. Suggest specific experiments with metrics and methodologies

I should be concrete and actionable. The user is likely a researcher planning experiments.

Key areas of existing work:
- Quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, bitsandbytes)
- Pruning (unstructured, structured, magnitude-based, movement pruning)
- Knowledge Distillation
- Low-rank factorization
- Architecture design (MoE, sparse patterns)
- Efficient attention (FlashAttention, etc.)

Novelty could be in:
- New compression methods
- Better understanding of why some models compress better
- Compression at different stages (pretraining, finetuning, post-hoc)
- Compression for specific properties (reasoning, memorization)
- Theoretical connections to generalization

For tests, I should suggest:
- Baselines: Compare against standard methods
- Metrics: Perplexity, downstream task performance, size, speed, memory
- Ablation studies: What components matter?
- Analysis: Where does compression hurt performance? Which layers? Which types of knowledge?
- Scaling laws: How does compressibility change with scale?

Let me write a comprehensive but clear answer.

"Compressible LLMs" is a good framing, but the novelty depends heavily on which angle you take. Here are the main interpretations and how to carve out something new:

---

### **1. Clarify What You Mean**

The term could refer to:
- **Post-hoc compression**: Applying quantization/pruning to existing LLMs (well-trodden)
- **Inherent compressibility**: Architectural properties that make models *naturally* compressible (more interesting)
- **LLMs *as* compressors **: Using LLMs for data compression (theoretically rich, underexplored)
- ** Compressibility as a metric **: Using compression ratios to evaluate models (novel perspective)

---

### ** 2. Novelty Check: What's Already Done **

** Saturated areas **:
- Quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, QLoRA) - very mature
- Unstructured pruning - standard, but brittle
- Standard distillation - hard at scale

** Gaps & Opportunities **:
- ** Structured compression ** that preserves emergent abilities (e.g., reasoning, in-context learning)
- ** Dynamic/sparse activation patterns ** (which subnetworks matter for which inputs?)
- ** Compressibility during pretraining ** (can you *train* for compressibility?)
- ** Theoretical links ** between compressibility, generalization, and scaling laws
- ** Compression for specific capabilities ** (compress memorization but preserve reasoning)

---

### ** 3. Concrete Tests to Run **

#### ** A. Baseline Sweep (Establish Your Floor) **
Run these on 2-3 model sizes (e.g., 1B, 7B, 13B):
- ** Quantization **: GPTQ, AWQ, bitsandbytes (4-bit → 2-bit)
- ** Pruning **: Magnitude, Wanda, SparseGPT (unstructured & 2:4/4:8 structured)
- ** Distillation **: Distill to 30-50% size, measure KL divergence

** Metrics **: Perplexity, MMLU, HellaSwag, GSM8K, inference speed, memory footprint.  
** Key analysis **: Plot *size vs. performance* Pareto curves for each method.

#### ** B. Compressibility Analysis (The "Why") **
- ** Layer-wise sensitivity **: Compress each layer independently. Which layers are most robust? (Often: early layers are fragile)
- ** Attention vs. MLP **: Prune attention heads vs. MLP neurons separately. Which matters more for which tasks?
- ** Rank analysis **: Compute SVD of weight matrices. Plot singular value decay. Are some layers inherently low-rank?

#### ** C. Architectural Probing (If Designing for Compression) **
- ** Train with sparsity-inducing regularization **: L1 on activations, weight decay variants. Does it improve post-hoc compression?
- ** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) as compression **: Train dense model, then extract top-K experts per layer. Measure "effective parameter count."
- ** Input-dependent routing **: Train a tiny gating network that skips layers/heads. Measure average compute vs. performance.

#### ** D. LLM-as-Compressor (Theoretical) **
- ** Compress a corpus **: Use model to compress Wikipedia (arithmetic coding on token probabilities). Compare compression ratio to gzip, bzip2.
- ** Correlation check **: Does better compression (lower bits-per-byte) correlate with downstream performance? Test across model scales.

---

### ** 4. What Would Actually Be Novel **

Focus on a question like:
- *"Which emergent abilities survive aggressive compression, and why?"*
- *"Can we predict compressibility from training dynamics (gradient norms, Hessian spectrum)?"*
- *"Is there a 'critical compression threshold' where in-context learning breaks?"*

Run **ablations that answer a specific mechanism**, not just "method X is better."

---

**Quick Start**: Pick a 7B model, run Wanda pruning at 50% sparsity, and **analyze which MMLU subjects drop most**. That'll reveal if compression hits factual knowledge vs. reasoning differently—likely a small but publishable insight.
