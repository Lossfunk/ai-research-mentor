  The user is asking for help crafting double-blind compliance notes for a human-centered AI evaluation paper. This involves:
1. Double-blind compliance notes (for anonymity in peer review)
2. Artifact release notes (for making code/data available)
3. Anonymized appendices

This is a common requirement for academic conferences, especially in HCI and AI venues like CHI, CSCW, FAccT, NeurIPS, etc. I need to provide guidance on how to write these sections while preserving anonymity.

Let me think about what each component needs:

**Double-blind compliance notes**: These typically explain how the authors have ensured anonymity in their submission. This includes:
- Removing author names and affiliations from the paper
- Anonymizing citations to the authors' own prior work
- Removing identifying information from the appendix
- Ensuring the artifact release doesn't compromise anonymity
- Describing how the system/artifact will be anonymized for review

**Artifact release**: This needs to balance transparency with anonymity. Common approaches:
- Providing an anonymous link (e.g., anonymous GitHub repo, anonymous Dropbox/Google Drive)
- Including instructions for reviewers to access it
- Describing what the artifact contains (code, data, etc.)
- Mentioning that identifying information will be removed upon acceptance

**Anonymized appendices**: These should contain supplementary material without revealing author identities. This might include:
- Survey instruments
- Interview protocols
- Additional results
- System screenshots (with identifying info removed)
- IRB approval letters (with institution info redacted)

I should provide templates and concrete examples that the user can adapt. I should also mention common pitfalls and best practices.

Let me structure my response:
1. Overview of double-blind requirements
2. Template for double-blind compliance notes
3. Template for artifact release section
4. Guidance on anonymized appendices
5. Best practices and checklist
6. Example scenarios

I should be careful not to assume a specific conference, so I'll make it general but mention common venues as examples. I'll also note that requirements vary by venue.

The user wants "help me craft" - so I should provide actual text they can use/modify, not just abstract advice. I'll create templates with clear placeholders.

Let me think about the specific content:

For double-blind compliance notes, I should include:
- Statement of anonymity
- How prior work is cited
- How the artifact is anonymized
- What will happen upon acceptance
- Any exceptions or special considerations

For artifact release:
- Anonymous URL
- Contents description
- Instructions for access
- License information (anonymized)
- Statement about deanonymization after acceptance

For anonymized appendices:
- What to include
- How to anonymize different types of content
- Special cases like IRB letters

I should also mention tools like Anonymous GitHub, Zenodo with anonymous links, etc.

Let me draft this now.

Here are templates and guidance for crafting double-blind compliance notes for a human-centered AI evaluation paper, including artifact release and anonymized appendices. These are designed for common venues like CHI, CSCW, FAccT, or similar double-blind conferences.

---

## **1. Double-Blind Compliance Statement (for paper submission)**

Place this in a dedicated section before references, titled "Double-Blind Compliance and Anonymized Artifact Release."

---

### **Template: Double-Blind Compliance Statement**

> **Double-Blind Compliance and Anonymized Artifact Release**
> 
> This submission complies with the double-blind review policy of [VENUE NAME]. We have taken the following steps to ensure anonymity:
> 
> 1. **Author Identity Removal**: All author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments have been removed from this manuscript. The manuscript is compiled using the anonymous submission option.
> 
> 2. **Self-Citations**: All citations to our prior work have been anonymized as "Anonymous" with identifying details removed. These will be restored upon acceptance. Specifically:
>    - [Anonymous, 2023] refers to our foundational work on [brief, neutral description]
>    - [Anonymous, 2024] refers to our dataset described in Section 4
> 
> 3. **System/Tool Names**: The evaluated system is referred to as "System X" throughout the paper. All logos, branding, and identifying UI elements have been removed from screenshots and figures.
> 
> 4. **Participant Recruitment**: Participant recruitment materials (e.g., MTurk/Prolific links) used generic language without institutional branding. IRB approval was obtained from a research institution; the approval letter is included in the anonymized appendix with identifying information redacted.
> 
> 5. **Artifact Anonymization**: The artifact release (Section 2) uses an anonymous repository and does not contain author-identifying information.
> 
> Upon acceptance, we will deanonymize the paper, restore all citations, and release the final artifact with author attribution.

---

## **2. Artifact Release Section (Anonymized)**

### **Template: Anonymized Artifact Release**

> **Artifact Release**
> 
> To ensure reproducibility and support future research, we provide an anonymized artifact containing:
> - De-identified dataset (n=XXX responses)
> - Analysis scripts (Python/R)
> - Survey instrument and interview protocol
> - System interface screenshots (anonymized)
> 
> **Anonymous Access**: Reviewers can access the artifact at:  
> 🔗 **https://anonymous.4open.science/r/[RANDOM-STRING]**  
> (or: anonymous GitHub link: https://github.com/Anonymous-HCAI-2024/artifact)
> 
> **Contents**: The repository includes:
> - `/data`: CSV files with participant responses; direct identifiers (names, emails) removed; geographic data aggregated to region-level
> - `/scripts`: Reproducible analysis pipeline (Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown)
> - `/materials`: Anonymized IRB approval letter, consent forms, survey instrument
> - `/screenshots`: UI figures from the paper in high resolution (identifying elements blurred)
> 
> **License**: The artifact is released under the MIT License (author field: "Anonymous Authors"; will be updated upon acceptance).
> 
> **Post-Acceptance**: We will archive the final artifact on Zenodo/OSF with DOI and proper attribution.

## **3. Anonymized Appendices Structure**

Create a separate file `appendix-anonymized.pdf` with the following sections:

### **A. IRB Approval Letter**
- **Redact**: Institution name, committee member names, logos, protocol numbers containing institution codes.
- **Keep**: Approval status, date (can keep year only), general protocol description.

> **[Redacted] Institutional Review Board**  
> **Approval Letter**
> 
> **Study Title**: Human Evaluation of AI-Generated Content  
> **Protocol #**: [REDACTED-2024-XXX]  
> **Approval Date**: [Month, 2024]
> 
> The above-referenced protocol has been approved. [Remaining text with institutional identifiers removed...]

### **B. Survey Instrument / Interview Protocol**
- Remove institutional letterheads
- Use generic email addresses (e.g., `research-study@anonymous.com`)
- Remove researcher names from consent language

### **C. Additional Screenshots**
- Blur or black out: logos, usernames, institutional branding, system names in URL bars
- Use generic labels: "System X", "User A", "Task 1"

### **D. Participant Demographics (Extended)**
- Aggregate small categories (e.g., if only 1-2 participants in a major, combine with "Other")
- Remove free-text responses that could identify institutions or locations

### **E. Extended Results**
- Ensure no deanonymizing details in qualitative quotes (check for names, places, system-specific terms)
- Remove participant IDs that could be traced to recruitment platforms

## **4. Best Practices Checklist**

**Before Submission:**
- [ ] Run `grep -r "University\|@institution\|FirstName" .` on your LaTeX source
- [ ] Check PDF metadata: `exiftool paper.pdf` (should not show author names)
- [ ] Verify all self-citations use "Anonymous" or third-person neutral language
- [ ] Test anonymous artifact link in incognito browser
- [ ] Ensure screenshots have no identifying pixels (check at 400% zoom)
- [ ] Remove "Acknowledgments" section entirely
- [ ] Check footer/header templates for bleed-through of author info
- [ ] Verify system name is generic throughout (including in code comments)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- **GitHub history**: Create a *new* clean repository; don't reuse one with prior commits
- **PDF metadata**: LaTeX `\pdfauthor{}` and `\pdftitle{}` must be empty or anonymous
- **Zoom backgrounds**: Screenshots may reveal institution in virtual backgrounds
- **Consent forms**: Often contain institution names in standard templates—redact thoroughly
- **Dataset**: Check for embedded metadata in CSV/JSON files (creator names, paths like `/Users/lastname/...`)

---

## **5. Example: Handling Specific Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: You must cite a non-anonymous dataset you created**
> "We use the [Anonymous] dataset, a publicly available corpus of X (originally published under the authors' real names, which are omitted for double-blind review)."

**Scenario 2: System is publicly associated with your lab**
> "We evaluate System X, a prototype developed for research purposes. While the system has been described in prior work [Anonymous, 2023], all identifying branding has been removed for this evaluation."

**Scenario 3: You need to share a demo video**
- Upload to YouTube/Vimeo as "Unlisted" with anonymous account
- Use screen recorder with no identifying OS elements
- Narrate with synthetic voice or text-only annotations

---

## **6. Post-Acceptance Steps**

Prepare a `deanonymization-plan.txt` in your repository:

```text
POST-ACCEPTANCE UPDATES:
1. Update repository name to: hcai-evaluation-[system-name]
2. Replace "Anonymous Authors" with: Jane Doe, John Smith, University of X
3. Restore citations: Replace [Anonymous, 2023] with actual references
4. Add IRB approval letter with full institution details
5. Update license and add CONTRIBUTING.md
6. Archive to Zenodo with DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX
```

---

**Final Tip**: Many conferences now have a "Supplementary Materials" upload option that is *only* visible to reviewers (not to other authors during rebuttal). Use this for your anonymized appendix if available, rather than including it in the main PDF, to reduce deanonymization risk.

Would you like me to tailor these templates to a specific conference (e.g., CHI 2025, FAccT) or a particular type of artifact (e.g., dataset vs. software system)?
