  The user wants a two-week sprint plan for polishing a camera-ready version of a graph foundation models paper. This includes:
1. Paper polishing
2. Artifact packaging
3. Licensing
4. Release notes

This is a research paper submission scenario, likely for a conference that requires artifacts. I need to create a detailed, actionable plan that covers all these aspects in a two-week sprint format.

Key considerations:
- Camera-ready deadlines are typically strict
- Artifact evaluation requires careful packaging and documentation
- Licensing needs to be properly chosen and applied
- Release notes should be comprehensive
- The plan should be realistic and account for dependencies

I should structure this as a sprint with daily tasks, organized by weeks, and include specific deliverables. I'll assume a typical 2-week period (10 working days) and include weekends for final touches if needed.

Let me create a comprehensive plan:

Week 1: Focus on paper finalization and artifact preparation
Week 2: Focus on licensing, release notes, final packaging, and submission

I'll break it down day by day with specific tasks, owners (if team-based), and deliverables. I should also include buffer time and contingency planning.

Key components to cover:
- Paper polishing: proofreading, figure quality, appendix, references
- Artifact packaging: code, data, models, environment, documentation
- Licensing: choosing a license, applying it to code/data, legal review
- Release notes: version history, features, known issues, citations
- Final checks: reproducibility, accessibility, metadata

I should also mention common pitfalls and best practices for each component.

# Two-Week Sprint Plan: Graph Foundation Models Paper & Artifact Release

## Week 1: Paper Finalization & Artifact Preparation

### Day 1-2: Paper Polish & Consistency Check
**Morning (4h):** 
- Perform complete read-through focusing on narrative flow and logical consistency
- Verify all theorem numbers, figure references, and citations are correct
- Check for "??" or "[?]" unresolved references
- Ensure consistent terminology: "graph foundation model" vs "GFM", "node embedding" vs "vertex representation"

**Afternoon (4h):**
- Finalize all figures: export at 600 DPI, verify font consistency (Helvetica/Computer Modern)
- Run algorithmic notation audit: ensure $G=(V,E)$ notation is consistent throughout
- Check appendix completeness: proofs, experimental details, dataset statistics
- **Deliverable:** Paper_v0.9.pdf with all internal references resolved

### Day 3: Reproducibility Audit
**Full day:**
- Execute entire experiment pipeline from scratch in clean environment
- Verify all random seeds produce reported results (within variance)
- Document exact hardware/software versions (CUDA, PyTorch, DGL/PyG versions)
- Time all experiments and add runtime to appendix table
- **Deliverable:** reproducibility_log.md with SHA hashes of key results

### Day 4-5: Code Artifact Packaging
**Day 4 (8h):**
- Create `/artifact` directory structure:
  ```
  ├── src/
  ├── data/
  ├── pre-trained-models/
  ├── scripts/
  ├── docs/
  └── README.md
  ```
- Strip repository of dead code, personal notes, and large temporary files
- Create `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` with exact versions
- Write `INSTALL.md` with step-by-step setup for CPU/GPU environments

**Day 5 (8h):**
- Build automated download script for datasets (OGB, synthetic graphs) with checksums
- Create model inference demo script that runs in <5 minutes on CPU
- Add progress bars and clear logging to all scripts
- **Deliverable:** Code repository ready for Docker containerization

## Week 2: Licensing, Documentation & Release

### Day 6: Licensing & Legal
**Morning (3h):**
- Choose license: **MIT License** for code, **CC BY-NC 4.0** for models/data (or match community standards)
- Add LICENSE file to repository root
- Insert license headers in all source files using `addlicense` tool

**Afternoon (5h):**
- Create `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for all dependencies
- Verify no proprietary data/snippets are included
- If using pre-trained models: add model cards with intended use limitations
- **Deliverable:** Repository with complete legal documentation

### Day 7-8: Release Notes & Metadata
**Day 7 (8h):**
- Write `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with sections:
  - Version (match paper version: v1.0-camera-ready)
  - Citation information (BibTeX from paper)
  - Features: model architectures, supported tasks, datasets
  - Known limitations: scalability bounds, graph size limits
  - Changelog from earlier preprints

**Day 8 (4h):**
- Create `CITATION.cff` file for GitHub integration
- Write `MODEL_CARD.md` with ethics statement, training data composition
- Generate `codemeta.json` for repository metadata
- **Deliverable:** Complete documentation suite

### Day 9: Containerization & Final Testing
**Full day:**
- Build Docker image: `docker build -t gfm-camera-ready .`
- Test image on fresh VM (AWS EC2/GCP instance)
- Create `run_all_experiments.sh` that reproduces main paper results
- Verify artifact size < 5GB (or conference limit); use git-lfs if needed
- **Deliverable:** Tested Docker image + push to Docker Hub

### Day 10: Submission Package & Buffer
**Morning (4h):**
- Create final submission zip: `paper.pdf`, `appendix.pdf`, `artifact.zip`
- Write artifact `README.md` with conference-specific badge instructions
- Record 3-minute demo video (screen capture of key experiments)
- Generate final SHA256 checksums for all files

**Afternoon (4h):**
- **Buffer time:** Address any issues from final tests
- Peer review: have labmate install and run artifact blind
- Final spell-check of all documentation
- **Deliverable:** camera_ready_package/ ready for portal submission

## Sprint-Wide Considerations

### Daily Standup (15 min)
- What did I complete?
- What technical debt remains?
- Are there any blockers (e.g., missing baseline data)?

### Contingency Tasks
- If experiments fail: Use cached results with explicit note in README
- If size limit exceeded: Host models on HuggingFace Hub with download script
- If legal questions: Contact university tech transfer office immediately

### Final Checklist
- [ ] Paper: All fonts embedded, page limits met, appendix properly referenced
- [ ] Code: Runs on CPU-only environment, includes quick-start demo
- [ ] License: Compatible with dependencies, includes all attributions
- [ ] Release notes: Clearly states what results are reproducible vs. approximate
- [ ] Metadata: DOI reserved (via Zenodo), GitHub repo is public/private as required

**Pro tip:** Start Day 10's buffer tasks on Day 9 if ahead of schedule—unexpected Docker issues are the #1 cause of missed artifact deadlines.
