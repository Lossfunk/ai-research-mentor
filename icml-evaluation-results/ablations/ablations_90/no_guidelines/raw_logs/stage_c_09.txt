  The user wants a one-year roadmap for evaluating interpretability tools on autonomous driving perception models. This is a complex research project that requires careful planning. I need to structure this as a comprehensive research plan with phases, milestones, ablations, and governance checkpoints.

Key components to include:
1. **Phases**: Break down the year into logical phases (e.g., foundation, implementation, evaluation, integration)
2. **Interpretability tools**: Identify relevant tools for autonomous driving perception
3. **Perception models**: Specify which types of models to evaluate
4. **Ablations**: Design systematic ablation studies
5. **Governance checkpoints**: Include review points, ethics considerations, safety reviews
6. **Metrics**: Define evaluation criteria
7. **Deliverables**: Specify outputs for each phase

Let me structure this as a 12-month roadmap with quarterly phases, monthly milestones, and clear governance checkpoints.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Tool Selection (Months 1-3)**
- Literature review
- Tool selection
- Dataset curation
- Baseline model selection
- Governance: Ethics approval, safety protocol

**Phase 2: Implementation & Baseline (Months 4-6)**
- Tool implementation
- Baseline evaluations
- Initial ablations
- Governance: Mid-year review, safety audit

**Phase 3: Deep Evaluation & Ablations (Months 7-9)**
- Comprehensive evaluation
- Ablations
- Human studies
- Governance: Ethics review, stakeholder review

**Phase 4: Integration & Final Assessment (Months 10-12)**
- Tool integration
- Real-world validation
- Final reporting
- Governance: Final review, publication review

I should include specific interpretability tools like:
- Saliency maps (Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients)
- Concept-based methods (TCAV, Concept Bottleneck Models)
- Counterfactual explanations
- Attention visualization
- Feature attribution methods

For autonomous driving perception, focus on:
- Object detection (cars, pedestrians, cyclists)
- Semantic segmentation
- Depth estimation
- Sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, radar)

Ablations should cover:
- Tool parameters
- Model architectures
- Input modalities
- Scenario complexity

Governance checkpoints should address:
- Safety reviews
- Ethics board approval
- Stakeholder engagement
- Regulatory compliance (especially important for autonomous driving)

Let me create a detailed, actionable roadmap.
