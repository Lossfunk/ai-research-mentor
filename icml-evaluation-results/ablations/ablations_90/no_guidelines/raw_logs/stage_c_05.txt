  The user wants help planning AI research but doesn't know Python. This is a common situation - many researchers come from different backgrounds or are just starting out. I should provide practical, actionable advice that acknowledges this constraint while not making it seem like an insurmountable barrier.

Key points to address:
1. Python is the dominant language in AI/ML, but it's not the only path
2. How to approach learning Python efficiently if they want to go that route
3. Alternative tools and frameworks that require less coding
4. Research planning strategies that minimize immediate coding needs
5. Building foundational knowledge first
6. Collaboration strategies
7. Specific resources for non-Python approaches

I should be encouraging but realistic. Python is indeed important, but they can start research planning and even some experiments without deep Python knowledge initially.

Let me structure this as a phased approach:
- Phase 1: Foundational planning (no coding needed)
- Phase 2: Low-code/no-code tools
- Phase 3: Learning Python efficiently (if they choose)
- Phase 4: Collaboration models

I should also mention specific alternatives like:
- MATLAB (common in some fields)
- R (for statistical ML)
- GUI-based tools (RapidMiner, KNIME)
- Cloud AutoML platforms
- Julia (growing in scientific computing)
- Using LLMs to help write code

The research planning itself should be language-agnostic: literature review, problem formulation, hypothesis development, experimental design, etc.

I need to be concrete and give specific examples of tools and resources. I should also address the mindset - not knowing Python now doesn't mean they can't do AI research, but it might affect the pace and approach.

Let me make sure I'm not overwhelming them. The key is to start where they are and build a path forward.

Great! Not knowing Python is a temporary obstacle, not a dealbreaker. Here's a practical roadmap for planning and starting AI research while building coding skills at a sustainable pace:

## **Phase 1: Research Planning (Start Here - No Coding Needed)**

**Focus on the science, not the tools:**
- **Literature review**: Use Google Scholar, arXiv, Papers With Code. Understand what problems exist and where the gaps are.
- **Problem formulation**: Clearly define your research question. What do you want to discover or improve?
- **Hypothesis development**: What do you predict your results will be? What theory underpins this?
- **Experimental design**: What data would you need? What metrics would measure success? Sketch flowcharts on paper.
- **Baseline identification**: Find existing papers with code/repos you can eventually modify or run as-is.

**Tools**: Zotero/Mendeley for papers, Notion/Obsidian for notes, draw.io for diagrams.

## **Phase 2: Low/No-Code Experimentation**

Start building intuition without deep coding:

- **Google Colab + LLMs**: Use Claude or ChatGPT to generate Python code snippets. You can run these in Colab's free notebooks by just clicking "Run." Copy-paste errors back to the LLM for fixes.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Many models have web demos. Test hypotheses by experimenting with inputs/outputs.
- **MATLAB**: If you have access, its ML toolbox is GUI-driven and well-documented (common in engineering labs).
- **R + Tidymodels**: If you know R, it's viable for statistical ML.
- **Cloud AutoML**: Google Vertex AI, Azure ML, or Amazon SageMaker Canvas let you train models with minimal code.
- **Julia**: Syntax is more math-friendly; growing in scientific AI (SciML).

## **Phase 3: Strategic Python Learning (Parallel Track)**

Don't aim to "master Python" first. Learn **just enough** for research:

1. **Week 1-2**: Basics (variables, loops, functions) via *Python for Everybody* (free) or *Automate the Boring Stuff*.
2. **Week 3-4**: NumPy & Pandas for data manipulation. Use *Kaggle Learn* micro-courses (4 hours each).
3. **Week 5+**: Pick **one** framework: PyTorch (more research-friendly) or scikit-learn (for classical ML). Follow the official tutorials and **immediately** apply to your problem.

**Key strategy**: Learn by modifying existing code from Papers With Code, not from scratch.

## **Phase 4: Collaboration & Resource Hacks**

- **Find a coding collaborator**: Pair with a CS student or postdoc. You bring domain expertise; they bring implementation skills.
- **Use RA/TA budget**: Hire an undergrad coder to implement your designs.
- **Ask your advisor**: Many labs have code templates and senior students who can mentor.
- **GitHub Copilot**: $10/month, but writes 30-50% of code for you after minimal learning.

## **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Today**: Spend 2 hours on arXiv. Find 5 papers in your area. Download their code (even if you can't read it yet).
2. **This week**: Open a free Colab account. Ask an LLM: "Write Python code to load CSV data and plot it." Run it.
3. **This month**: Identify a "toy version" of your research problem that you could test with existing code.

**Bottom line**: Start planning *now*. The coding will catch up. Most successful AI researchers spend 80% of their time thinking and 20% coding anyway.
