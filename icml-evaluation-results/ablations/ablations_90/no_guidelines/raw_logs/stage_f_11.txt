  The user is asking for a comprehensive dissemination plan for a sustainable AI optimization project. This involves multiple components:

1. **Code, models, and datasets release strategy**
2. **Licensing considerations**
3. **README structure**
4. **Community channels**

This is a research-oriented question about best practices for open-sourcing AI research outputs with a focus on sustainability. I should provide a detailed, actionable plan that covers:

- Release timing and versioning
- Platform selection (GitHub, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Licensing options for different components (code, models, data)
- README structure with sustainability focus
- Community engagement strategy
- Documentation and support
- Impact measurement
- Sustainability considerations throughout

Let me structure this comprehensively:

**1. Release Strategy & Timeline**
- Phased approach
- Versioning system
- Platform selection

**2. Licensing Framework**
- Code license
- Model license
- Dataset license
- Commercial use considerations
- Ethical/sustainability clauses

**3. README Structure**
- Clear sections
- Sustainability metrics
- Usage examples
- Citation info

**4. Community Channels**
- Communication platforms
- Contribution guidelines
- Governance model

**5. Documentation & Support**
- Technical docs
- Tutorials
- Issue management

**6. Impact & Sustainability Tracking**
- Usage metrics
- Environmental impact
- Community health

**7. Long-term Maintenance**
- Sustainability plan
- Funding models
- Succession planning

I should make this practical and tailored to the "sustainable AI optimization" theme, ensuring environmental considerations are woven throughout. I'll use established best practices from open-source research projects and add specific sustainability-focused elements.

Let me draft this now.

## 3. README Structure Template

```markdown
# [Project Name]: Sustainable AI Optimization Toolkit

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/carbon-badge.svg" alt="Carbon Footprint: 12.3 kg CO2e">
  <img src="assets/energy-badge.svg" alt="Energy Savings: Up to 45%">
</div>

## 🌱 Sustainability Impact
- **Training emissions**: 12.3 kg CO2e (verified with CodeCarbon)
- **Average inference savings**: 35-45% energy reduction
- **Equivalent impact**: Removing 2 cars from road for 1 day

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install with pip (recommended)
pip install sustainable-ai-opt

# Verify installation and get sustainability baseline
python -c "import sustainable_ai_opt; print(sustainable_ai_opt.get_carbon_footprint())"
```

## 📊 Performance vs. Efficiency Trade-offs
| Model | Accuracy | Energy (Wh) | Carbon (g) | Efficiency Score* |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Baseline | 92.1% | 450 | 180 | 1.0x |
| Ours (int8) | 91.8% | 248 | 99 | 1.82x |

*Efficiency Score = Accuracy / Carbon
