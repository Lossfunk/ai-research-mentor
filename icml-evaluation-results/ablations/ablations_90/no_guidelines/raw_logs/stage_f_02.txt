<thinking>
  The user wants me to check their paper for ethics/compliance risks related to:
1. Dataset licenses
2. Human data
3. Compute disclosures

They want me to list fixes for any issues found.

However, I don't see any paper attached or provided. I need to ask the user to provide the paper (or relevant sections) so I can actually check it.

I should:
1. Acknowledge their request
2. Explain what I need to help them
3. Ask them to provide the paper or relevant sections
4. Offer to check specific sections if they don't want to share the full paper
5. Briefly outline what I'll be looking for in each category to show I understand the task

Let me craft a helpful response.

I'd be happy to help check your paper for ethics and compliance risks! To do this effectively, I'll need you to provide the paper or relevant sections.

**Please share:**
- The full paper (PDF or text), OR
- Specific sections covering: datasets, methods, ethics statements, acknowledgments, and any supplementary materials

---

### What I'll check for:

**1. Dataset Licenses**
- Missing or incorrect license attributions
- Commercial use restrictions
- Share-alike requirements
- Proper citations vs. just URLs
- Derivative work permissions

**2. Human Data**
- IRB approval statements (or lack thereof)
- Consent procedures documented
- Privacy protection measures (anonymization, PII removal)
- Data collection ethics compliance
- Special population considerations (minors, vulnerable groups)
- Re-identification risk assessment

**3. Compute Disclosures**
- Missing hardware specifications
- Incomplete carbon footprint estimates
- Energy consumption details
- Cloud vs. local compute attribution
- Reproducibility information (runtime, cost estimates)

**If you can't share the full paper**, you can paste the relevant paragraphs here, and I'll review those specifically.
