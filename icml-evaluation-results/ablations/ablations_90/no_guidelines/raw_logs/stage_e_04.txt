  The user is asking about the PeerRead paper and what targeted ablations and error analyses reviewers would expect for the paper acceptance classification task, particularly regarding hand-engineered features.

First, I need to recall what the PeerRead paper is. PeerRead is a dataset and study from 2018 by Kang et al. (or similar authors) about predicting paper acceptance. The key aspect is that it compares hand-engineered features with neural/textual features.

The user is specifically asking about:
1. Targeted ablations reviewers would expect
2. Error analyses reviewers would expect
3. Especially concerning hand-engineered features

Let me think about the PeerRead paper's setup:
- Task: Predicting paper acceptance (accept/reject)
- Features: Hand-engineered features (metadata, author stats, etc.) vs. textual features from the paper content
- Models: Various classifiers (LR, SVM, etc.) on different feature sets

Key hand-engineered features in PeerRead typically include:
- Author-related features (h-index, past acceptance rate, seniority)
- Venue-related features (impact factor, acceptance rate)
- Paper metadata (number of references, pages, etc.)
- Abstract/summary features (but these might be textual)

Reviewers would expect ablations that test the importance and interaction of these feature groups. They'd want to know:
- Which feature groups are most predictive?
- Do hand-engineered features add value beyond text?
- Are there confounding factors?
- How robust are the results?

For error analysis, reviewers would expect:
- Analysis of false positives/negatives
- Domain-specific errors (e.g., certain venues, author types)
- Temporal analysis (data leakage, train/test splits)
- Feature importance analysis
- Qualitative examples

Let me structure a comprehensive answer covering:
1. Expected ablation studies
2. Expected error analyses
3. Specific considerations for hand-engineered features
4. Potential reviewer concerns and how to address them

I should be specific and actionable, suggesting concrete experiments and analyses that would strengthen the paper.

Based on typical reviewer expectations for the PeerRead acceptance classification task, here are the targeted ablations and error analyses they'd likely demand, especially concerning hand-engineered features:

## **Expected Ablations**

### **1. Feature Group Ablation (Most Critical)**
Reviewers will expect systematic removal of hand-engineered feature groups to isolate contributions:
- **Author prestige features only**: h-index, past acceptance rates, seniority, institution rank
- **Venue features only**: impact factor, historical acceptance rate, venue prestige scores
- **Paper metadata only**: page count, reference count, figure/table counts, appendix presence
- **Textual features only**: abstract, title, introduction (TF-IDF or embeddings)
- **Combinations**: Author+Venue vs. Author+Text vs. Venue+Text

**Key test**: Show that hand-engineered features provide *incremental* value beyond text by demonstrating a significant drop in performance when removed from a joint model.

### **2. Temporal Ablation**
- **Train on older papers, test on recent papers**: This tests if hand-engineered features capture stable signals vs. spurious temporal correlations
- **Remove features that could leak future information**: e.g., author h-index *at submission time* vs. *current h-index* (critical to avoid data leakage)

### **3. Interaction Ablation**
- **Linear vs. non-linear interactions**: Test if tree-based models (XGBoost) on hand-features outperform logistic regression, suggesting complex interactions
- **Feature crossing ablation**: Explicitly test crossed features (e.g., author seniority × venue tier)

### **4. Ablation by Venue Subset**
- **High-impact vs. low-impact venues**: Hand-features may matter more at selective venues
- **Single-blind vs. double-blind venues**: If double-blind data exists, test if author features still "work" (suggests bias or leakage)

## **Expected Error Analyses**

### **1. Confusion Matrix Stratification**
- **False positives**: Papers with low hand-feature scores but accepted (text quality triumphs)
- **False negatives**: Papers with high hand-feature scores but rejected (maybe controversial or off-topic)
- **Quantify**: "What % of errors are from high-prestige authors?"

### **2. Feature Importance Sanity Checks**
- **SHAP/LIME on hand-features**: Are models using plausible features? Reviewers will flag if "author name length" is top-weighted
- **Permutation importance**: Show that shuffling author identity features hurts performance more than shuffling reference count

### **3. Temporal Drift Analysis**
- **Plot performance by year**: If hand-feature model degrades faster than text model, it suggests overfitting to historical biases
- **Author feature stability**: Do models rely on features that change over time (e.g., h-index inflation)?

### **4. Qualitative Case Studies**
Reviewers expect **3-5 concrete examples**:
- **High-prestige author, rejected**: Show text signals (weak methods, limited novelty) that overrode features
- **Unknown author, accepted**: Show strong textual signals that compensated for weak hand-features
- **Borderline cases**: Where hand-features tipped the balance

### **5. Bias and Fairness Analysis**
- **Demographic parity**: Do acceptance predictions for female/underrepresented authors differ when controlling for text quality?
- **Institution bias**: Are state university papers under-predicted vs. Ivy League papers with similar text?

### **6. Cross-Venue Generalization**
- **Train on CS venues, test on Physics/Econ**: Hand-features (especially venue-specific ones) should fail; text features should generalize better
- **This directly tests if hand-features are just memorizing venue biases**

## **Reviewer Red Flags to Preempt**

1. **"You're just predicting author prestige"**: Include an ablation where author features are replaced with *random* author IDs to show the model isn't just memorizing a few famous names
2. **"Data leakage through h-index"**: Explicitly state h-index is computed *up to submission date only* and provide an ablation using *pre-submission* metrics only
3. **"Hand-features are just proxies for text quality"**: Show partial dependence plots: for papers with *identical BERT embeddings*, do hand-features still vary predictions?

**Bottom line**: Reviewers want evidence that hand-features capture *signal*, not *noise or bias*, and that they complement rather than duplicate textual information.
