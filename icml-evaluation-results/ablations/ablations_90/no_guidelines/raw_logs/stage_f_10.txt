  The user is asking about ethics/compliance sections required for a "language-model-for-law" paper for major AI conferences. They specifically mention disclosure checklists and artifact adherence. This is a specific, technical question about academic publishing requirements.

I need to provide accurate information about:
1. Ethics/compliance sections generally required for law-related AI papers
2. Specific disclosure checklists (like NeurIPS checklist, ACL checklist, etc.)
3. Artifact adherence requirements (like artifact submission, reproducibility)
4. Conference-specific requirements for major AI venues

The user is asking about "major AI conferences" - I should cover the top-tier ones like:
- NeurIPS
- ICML
- ICLR
- ACL/EMNLP (for NLP-focused work)
- AAAI
- FAccT (for fairness/accountability)
- COLING

For a language-model-for-law paper, there are special considerations:
- Legal domain has high stakes
- Potential for misuse
- Privacy/confidentiality issues with legal data
- Bias and fairness concerns
- Professional responsibility implications

I should structure my answer to cover:
1. General ethics sections needed
2. Specific disclosure checklists by conference
3. Artifact submission requirements
4. Special considerations for legal domain
5. A checklist/summary they can use

I don't need to use tools for this - this is knowledge I have about academic publishing standards. I should be comprehensive and accurate.

Let me think about the specific requirements:

**NeurIPS**:
- Broader Impact Statement (required)
- NeurIPS Checklist (required)
- Ethics review for sensitive papers
- Artifact submission (optional but encouraged)

**ICML**:
- Broader Impact Statement
- Checklist
- Artifact submission

**ICLR**:
- Ethics guidelines
- Reproducibility checklist
- Code submission encouraged

**ACL/EMNLP**:
- Ethics statement
- Reproducibility checklist
- Limitations section
- Artifact submission

**AAAI**:
- Ethics statement
- Code/data availability

**FAccT**:
- Very heavy on ethics, social impact

For legal domain specifically:
- Data privacy and confidentiality
- Attorney-client privilege concerns
- Potential for unauthorized practice of law
- Bias against protected classes
- Transparency and explainability needs
- Professional ethics rules

I should provide a comprehensive list that the user can check off.

Here are the essential ethics/compliance sections and checklists your language-model-for-law paper must satisfy for major AI conferences:

## **1. Mandatory Ethics & Broader Impact Sections**

### **For All Major Conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI):**
- **Broader Impact Statement** (1-2 paragraphs): Discuss potential societal consequences, both positive and negative, specific to legal applications
- **Ethics Statement** (dedicated section): Address legal domain-specific risks:
  - Privacy/confidentiality of legal data (attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine)
  - Risk of unauthorized practice of law
  - Potential for reinforcing systemic biases (e.g., against protected classes in sentencing, bail, hiring)
  - Misuse for surveillance, legal harassment, or evading regulation
  - Impact on legal professionals and access to justice
- **Limitations Section**: Explicitly state model limitations that could lead to legal errors or malpractice

### **Conference-Specific Requirements:**
- **ACL/EMNLP**: Requires explicit "Limitations" and "Ethics Statement" sections
- **NeurIPS**: Broader Impact Statement is mandatory; ethics review triggered for high-risk applications
- **FAccT**: Requires comprehensive ethics analysis and stakeholder impact assessment

## **2. Disclosure Checklists**

### **NeurIPS Paper Checklist** (must be included in appendix):
- **Computing Resources**: Full hardware specs, total compute time, cloud costs
- **Data**: Sources, licenses, privacy protections, anonymization methods
- **Model**: Architecture details, hyperparameters, training procedures
- **Experiments**: Number of runs, random seeds, statistical significance tests
- **Access**: Whether data/models can be released given legal constraints
- **Ethical Concerns**: Specific risks and mitigation strategies

### **ACL/EMNLP Reproducibility Checklist**:
- **Data**: Collection process, splits, preprocessing, licensing
- **Model**: Complete architecture specification, initialization
- **Training**: Hyperparameters, number of parameters, optimization details
- **Evaluation**: Metrics, significance testing, random seeds
- **Resources**: Compute infrastructure, total runtime

### **ICML Reproducibility Checklist**:
Similar to NeurIPS but with stronger emphasis on:
- Code availability
- Full experimental setup details
- Ablation studies

---

## **3. Artifact Adherence Requirements**

### **Artifact Submission Policies:**
- **NeurIPS/ICML**: 
  - Code submission *strongly encouraged* (can be marked "non-anonymous" for legal review)
  - If data cannot be shared (common in legal domain), provide:
    - Synthetic data examples matching format
    - Detailed data statement explaining restrictions
    - Instructions for data access agreements
  - Model weights: Submit if possible, or provide training scripts

- **ACL/EMNLP**:
  - Mandatory "Data Availability" statement
  - Artifact submission track available (badges for availability)
  - For legal data: Document anonymization pipeline and IRB/ethics board approval

### **Legal Domain-Specific Artifact Requirements:**
- **Data Use Agreements**: If using private legal data (PACER, Westlaw, Lexis), state compliance with terms
- **Anonymization Certification**: Describe methods for removing PII, privileged information
- **Licensing**: Specify if model outputs could constitute legal advice (liability disclaimers)
- **Access Tiers**: Propose staged release based on user credentials (e.g., researchers vs. practitioners)

## **4. Special Compliance for Legal AI**

### **Additional Sections to Include:**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Discuss alignment with:
  - ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (especially 1.1 competence, 5.3 non-lawyer assistance)
  - GDPR/CCPA if applicable
  - Court rules on AI-generated filings (e.g., recent Texas/Manhattan requirements)
- **Bias Auditing**: Report results from bias testing across protected classes (race, gender, income)
- **Error Analysis**: Document failure modes that could cause legal malpractice
- **Human-AI Interaction Protocol**: Specify required human oversight for legal tasks

### **Documentation to Prepare (for reviewers):**
- IRB approval or exemption letter (if using human subjects data)
- Data license agreements
- Legal ethics consultation memo (if available)
- Risk assessment matrix

---

## **5. Summary Checklist for Submission**

- [ ] Broader Impact Statement addressing legal-specific risks
- [ ] Dedicated Ethics Statement section
- [ ] Limitations section with legal failure modes
- [ ] Completed conference-specific checklist (NeurIPS/ACL/etc.)
- [ ] Data statement with privacy/anonymization details
- [ ] Compute resources disclosure
- [ ] Code submission (or detailed explanation if restricted)
- [ ] Model architecture and training details
- [ ] Statistical significance testing reported
- [ ] Regulatory compliance discussion
- [ ] Bias audit results (if applicable)
- [ ] Artifact availability statement with legal constraints noted
- [ ] IRB/data license documentation ready for PC chairs if requested

**Pro Tip**: For legal domain papers, consider submitting to the **FAccT conference** or **Legal NLP workshops** (at ACL/EMNLP) where reviewers are more familiar with legal ethics constraints.
