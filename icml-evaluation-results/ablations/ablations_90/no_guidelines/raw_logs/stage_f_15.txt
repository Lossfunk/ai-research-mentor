<thinking>
  The user wants a step-by-step publishing playbook for a cross-lingual dialogue paper. This is a very specific and practical request. I need to cover:
1. Camera-ready preparation
2. Archival uploads (likely to arXiv, ACL Anthology, etc.)
3. Disclosure statements

Since this is about academic publishing, I should be comprehensive and cover typical venues like ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, etc., which are common for dialogue and NLP papers. I should also mention conference-specific requirements and general best practices.

Let me structure this as a clear, actionable playbook with distinct phases. I'll make it detailed enough to be useful but general enough to apply to different venues.

Key considerations for cross-lingual dialogue papers:
- Multiple languages involved
- Potential use of translation
- Data collection across languages
- Ethical considerations
- Reproducibility
- Resource availability

I should include:
- Pre-camera-ready checks
- Formatting requirements
- Software/artifact preparation
- ArXiv submission process
- ACL Anthology process
- Disclosure statement specifics
- Ethical considerations specific to cross-lingual work
- Post-publication steps

Let me create a comprehensive, step-by-step guide.

# Cross-Lingual Dialogue Paper Publishing Playbook

## Phase 1: Camera-Ready Preparation (2-4 weeks before deadline)

### Step 1: Verify Venue Requirements
- [ ] Download the official camera-ready checklist from the conference website (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/etc.)
- [ ] Check exact page limits (long/short papers often differ for camera-ready)
- [ ] Verify formatting requirements (fonts, margins, line spacing)
- [ ] Note the deadline timezone (usually AoE - Anywhere on Earth)
- [ ] Confirm if supplementary materials count toward page limit

### Step 2: Finalize Paper Content
- [ ] **Cross-lingual specific checks:**
  - [ ] All language codes follow ISO 639-1 standards (e.g., "en" not "English")
  - [ ] Language names are consistent throughout (e.g., "Chinese" vs "Mandarin")
  - [ ] Translation protocols are fully described (human, machine, or hybrid)
  - [ ] Annotator language proficiency levels are documented
  - [ ] Any transliteration schemes are explicitly defined
- [ ] Run final spell-check in *all* languages used in examples
- [ ] Verify all tables/figures render correctly in PDF
- [ ] Ensure example dialogues are properly aligned and readable
- [ ] Check that language-specific fonts are embedded in PDF

### Step 3: Formatting & Compilation
- [ ] Use official LaTeX/Word template (never modify margins/fonts)
- [ ] Set `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` and needed language packages (e.g., `\usepackage{CJK}`)
- [ ] Run `pdffonts yourpaper.pdf` to verify all fonts are embedded
- [ ] Check for Type 3 fonts (common with matplotlib plots) and replace with Type 1
- [ ] Ensure paper compiles cleanly with no warnings
- [ ] Verify PDF is PDF/A compliant if required (`pdfx` package can help)

### Step 4: Accessibility Checks
- [ ] Add `\pdfstringdefDisableCommands` for proper metadata
- [ ] Verify screen readers can read your PDF (test with Adobe Acrobat's Read Aloud)
- [ ] Ensure colorblind-friendly palettes in all figures (use ColorBrewer or Viridis)
- [ ] Add alt-text descriptions for figures in the LaTeX source (using `\Description{}` in ACL templates)

### Step 5: Author Information Finalization
- [ ] Confirm author order and affiliations with all co-authors
- [ ] Use consistent author names (match ORCID and previous publications)
- [ ] Add ORCID IDs if venue requires them
- [ ] Verify email addresses are professional and permanent

## Phase 2: Supplementary Materials & Artifacts

### Step 6: Prepare Supplementary Files
- [ ] Create `README.txt` with clear file descriptions
- [ ] Organize into logical folders: `data/`, `code/`, `appendices/`
- [ ] **Cross-lingual specific inclusions:**
  - [ ] Original dialogues in source languages
  - [ ] Translation guidelines given to annotators
  - [ ] Language proficiency test scores/certificates (anonymized)
  - [ ] Bilingual evaluation rubrics
  - [ ] Code-switching annotation guidelines if applicable

### Step 7: Anonymization Check
- [ ] Scrub GitHub repositories of private information
- [ ] Remove internal project names from code comments
- [ ] Check for hardcoded file paths revealing usernames
- [ ] Ensure no author names in data files or logs
- [ ] Verify license files don't contain author emails

### Step 8: License & Documentation
- [ ] Choose appropriate license (MIT for code, CC-BY for data)
- [ ] Add `LICENSE.txt` to root directory
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` with exact versions
- [ ] Document language-specific dependencies (e.g., jieba for Chinese, MeCab for Japanese)
- [ ] Add `CITATION.bib` file with expected citation format

## Phase 3: Disclosure Statements (Critical for Cross-Lingual)

### Step 9: Data Statement (Mandatory for ACL)
Create a dedicated section following Bender & Friedman (2018) guidelines:

```latex
\section*{Data Statement}
\textbf{Languages:} English (en), Spanish (es), Mandarin Chinese (zh)
\textbf{Dialects:} Mexican Spanish, Mainland Mandarin
\textbf{Language Varieties:} Standard American English

\textbf{Speaker Demographics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{English:} 250 speakers, ages 18-35, self-reported L1 speakers
    \item \textbf{Spanish:} 250 speakers, ages 20-40, recruited via Latin American university
    \item \textbf{Chinese:} 250 speakers, ages 19-30, recruited via Chinese crowdsourcing platform
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Annotator Information:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professional translators with 5+ years experience
    \item Spanish: Certified by Mexican Association of Translators
    \item Chinese: HSK 6+ proficiency, verified via test
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Collection:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timeframe: March-June 2023
    \item Location: Online (Amazon MTurk for EN, Prolific for ES, 腾讯众包 for ZH)
    \item Compensation: \$15/hour (USD equivalent)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ethics Approval:} IRB Protocol #2023-0123, [University Name]
```

### Step 10: Limitations Statement
```latex
\section*{Limitations}
\textbf{Linguistic Coverage:} Our study covers only three high-resource languages. 
Low-resource languages like Swahili or Quechua are not included due to resource constraints.

\textbf{Cultural Nuances:} Translations may not capture culture-specific dialogue acts. 
For example, Spanish formal pronoun usage (usted) patterns may not generalize to 
Rioplatense Spanish.

\textbf{Annotator Bias:} All annotators were university-educated, potentially 
introducing sociolect bias. Dialectal variations within each language are under-represented.

\textbf{Evaluation:} Our automatic metrics (BLEU, chrF) may not correlate with 
human judgments across all language pairs, particularly for non-European languages.
```

### Step 11: Ethics Statement
```latex
\section*{Ethics Statement}
\textbf{Translator Compensation:} Professional translators were paid above local 
living wage rates (\$25/hour USD equivalent).

\textbf{Data Privacy:} All dialogue data was anonymized to remove personally 
identifiable information. Chinese data was stored on servers located within 
the EU to comply with GDPR.

\textbf{Language Communities:} For indigenous language data (if applicable), 
we obtained consent from community elders and will share 10\% of profits 
from commercial applications.

\textbf{Environmental Impact:} Training our largest model emitted approximately 
2.3 tons CO2eq. We offset this via Gold Standard certified projects and will 
release a carbon budget table.
```

### Step 12: Broader Impact Statement
Address potential harms specific to cross-lingual systems:
- Perpetuation of dialect bias
- Unequal performance across language varieties
- Potential for misuse in surveillance across languages
- Impact on professional translators
- Digital language death for low-resource languages

- [ ] Submit during business hours (EST) for faster approval
- [ ] After announcement, update with DOI once available

### Step 14: ACL Anthology Upload
- [ ] Wait for official notification from publication chairs
- [ ] Access the START system upload page
- [ ] Upload files in this order:
  1. PDF (final version)
  2. Supplementary materials (as single .tgz)
  3. Code repository (zip of GitHub release)
- [ ] Fill metadata form:
  - [ ] Verify author names match ORCID records
  - [ ] Add language tags in keywords: `multilingual dialogue`, `cross-lingual evaluation`
  - [ ] Link to associated workshop papers if any
- [ ] Upload corrected version if needed within 72-hour window

### Step 15: GitHub Release
- [ ] Create release tag: `v1.0-acl2024-camera-ready`
- [ ] Upload assets:
  - `data.tar.gz` (if allowed by venue)
  - `models.tar.gz` (trained checkpoints)
  - `paper.pdf` (camera-ready)
- [ ] Enable GitHub DOI via Zenodo integration
- [ ] Add citation information to README:
  ```markdown
  ## Citation

  @inproceedings{yourpaper2024,
    title = {Your Title},
    author = {Author, A. and Author, B.},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of ACL 2024},
    year = {2024}
  }
  ```
- [ ] Pin the repository to your profile

- [ ] Upload to Hugging Face Datasets hub:
  ```python
  from datasets import Dataset
  dataset = Dataset.from_dict({...})
  dataset.push_to_hub("your-org/crosslingual-dialogue-v1")
  ```
- [ ] Add language-specific metadata tags: `language:zh`, `language:es`
- [ ] Create dataset card with translation guidelines

### Step 20: Model Release
- [ ] Upload multilingual models to Hugging Face Hub
- [ ] Add language capabilities to model card:
  ```
  languages:
  - en
  - es
  - zh
  license: apache-2.0
  ```
- [ ] Include example code for each language
- [ ] Add fairness evaluation results per language

### Step 21: Community Engagement
- [ ] Create demo on Hugging Face Spaces with language selection

## Emergency Protocol: Last-Minute Issues

**If you discover a critical error after submission:**
1. **Within 72 hours:** Contact publication chairs immediately with corrected PDF
2. **After 72 hours:** Most venues allow minor corrections (typos, broken URLs) until a hard deadline
3. **Major errors:** May require withdrawal and resubmission to next venue

**If arXiv submission is delayed:**
- Submit with "Anonymous" as author temporarily
- Update metadata after conference notification

**If copyright issues arise:**
- Contact your institution's tech transfer office
- For translated data, ensure you have rights to both source and translations

---

## Final Pro Tips

- **Timeline:** Start camera-ready prep 4 weeks before deadline; last 48 hours should be for emergencies only
- **Backup:** Keep 3 copies: local, cloud (Dropbox), and version control (GitHub)
- **Co-authors:** Use shared checklist (Google Sheets) to track completion
- **Cross-lingual nuance:** Have a native speaker of *each* language review the final PDF for font rendering issues

Good luck with your publication!
