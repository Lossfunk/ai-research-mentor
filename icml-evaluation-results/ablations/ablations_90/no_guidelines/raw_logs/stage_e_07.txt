  The user is asking me to draft a response to reviewers who flagged missing comparisons to large language models in a PeerRead study. I need to:
1. Acknowledge the gap identified by reviewers
2. Outline a principled plan for future inclusion of LLM comparisons

First, I need to understand what PeerRead is. PeerRead is a dataset and framework for reviewing scientific papers, typically used in NLP research. The study likely involved some automated review generation or analysis system.

The reviewers are pointing out that the study didn't compare their approach against large language models (like GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.), which is a significant omission given the current state of the field. Many recent papers use LLMs as baselines or competitors.

I should draft a response that is:
- Succinct (as requested)
- Professional and constructive
- Acknowledges the limitation clearly
- Provides a concrete, principled plan for addressing it in future work

The plan should be "principled" meaning it should be thoughtful, systematic, and well-justified, not just "we'll add some LLM comparisons."

Key elements to include:
1. Acknowledgment of the gap and why it matters
2. Explanation of why it wasn't included (optional but helpful - maybe LLMs weren't as prevalent when the study was conducted, or computational/resource constraints)
3. A clear plan with specific dimensions:
   - Which models to compare against (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, open-source alternatives)
   - What aspects to compare (e.g., review quality, specific criteria)
   - How to evaluate (metrics, human evaluation)
   - Considerations like cost, reproducibility, etc.
   - Timeline or version where this will be included

Let me structure this as a response to reviewers, which would typically be part of a rebuttal or revision plan.

I should make it sound like it's coming from researchers who are taking the feedback seriously and have a well-thought-out plan.

Thank you for this important feedback. We agree that LLM comparisons are now essential for contextualizing our results.

**Acknowledgment & Rationale:**  
The current study predates widespread access to instruction-tuned LLMs. Including them retrospectively requires careful design to ensure fair, reproducible, and meaningful comparisons.

**Principled Plan for Future Work:**  
We will systematically benchmark against LLMs across three dimensions:

1. **Model Selection:** Compare against (a) API-based models (GPT-4, Claude) for performance ceiling, and (b) open-weight models (Llama-3, Mistral) for reproducibility. We'll document versions, parameters, and system prompts.

2. **Evaluation Protocol:** Match our task exactly: same input (paper + metadata), same output schema (structured reviews), and identical automatic metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore). We'll add targeted human evaluation on coherence and actionability, with cost-per-review reported.

3. **Analysis Depth:** Beyond head-to-head scores, we'll analyze failure modes where our approach differs from LLMs, particularly on long-context reasoning and domain-specific nuance, to clarify complementary value.

This will be a core component of our next submission.
