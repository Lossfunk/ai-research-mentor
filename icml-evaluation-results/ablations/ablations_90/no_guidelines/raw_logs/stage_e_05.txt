  The user wants me to frame a discussion response to reviewers who doubt the domain transferability of PeerRead aspect score models. I need to:
1. Acknowledge the reviewers' concerns about domain transferability
2. Provide pointers to new experiments or ablations that could address this critique
3. Be clear, helpful, and informative

First, I need to understand what PeerRead is. PeerRead is a dataset and framework for automated scientific paper review, particularly focusing on aspect-based review scoring (like clarity, originality, etc.). The domain transferability concern would be about whether models trained on one domain (e.g., computer science papers) can generalize to other domains (e.g., physics, biology).

The key concerns reviewers might have:
- Do the aspect scoring patterns generalize across domains?
- Are the linguistic features domain-specific?
- Does the model performance degrade significantly on out-of-domain data?
- Are the aspect definitions consistent across domains?

I should structure my response to:
1. Acknowledge the validity of the concern
2. Propose specific experiments to test transferability
3. Suggest ablation studies to understand what helps/hurts transfer
4. Discuss potential mitigation strategies
5. Keep it constructive and scientific

Let me think about specific experiments:

**Direct Transfer Experiments:**
- Train on one domain, test on others (zero-shot)
- Train on one domain, fine-tune on small samples from target domain (few-shot)
- Multi-domain training vs single-domain training

**Ablations:**
- Remove domain-specific vocabulary/features
- Analyze which aspects transfer better than others
- Compare different model architectures (size, pre-training data)
- Examine the effect of pre-training domain

**Analysis:**
- Error analysis on cross-domain predictions
- Feature space visualization (t-SNE/UMAP) to see domain overlap
- Measure domain similarity and correlate with transfer performance
- Human evaluation of cross-domain predictions

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Domain adaptation techniques
- Domain-aware training
- Meta-learning approaches
- Prompting strategies with domain context

I should frame this as a constructive response that shows we take the critique seriously and have a concrete plan to address it. The tone should be collaborative rather than defensive.

Let me draft the response:

Opening: Thank reviewers for raising this important concern
Body: 
- Acknowledge why transferability is crucial for practical deployment
- Propose specific experiments (zero-shot, few-shot, multi-domain)
- Suggest ablations (feature analysis, architecture comparison, aspect-level analysis)
- Discuss analysis methods (error analysis, embedding space analysis)
- Mention potential mitigation strategies
Closing: Emphasize that these experiments will strengthen the paper

I should be specific about what datasets to use, what metrics to report, and what hypotheses to test. For PeerRead, domains might include CS, Physics, etc. I should also mention using other review datasets like ASAP or ASAP-AC if available.

Let me make sure I'm accurate about PeerRead. PeerRead includes papers from ACL, NIPS, ICLR, etc., which are CS venues. The domain transferability question would be about transferring to non-CS venues or even other CS subfields.

I should also consider:
- Using domain adaptation benchmarks
- Testing on completely out-of-domain text (like news articles) to see if the model learns general quality aspects
- Comparing with baselines that are known to be more robust (like simpler models or different pre-training)

The response should be framed as something that could go into a paper's discussion section or a rebuttal letter.

Thank you for raising the critical question of domain transferability. This is indeed a key limitation of our current work and essential for the practical deployment of aspect score models. We appreciate the opportunity to outline concrete experiments and ablations to systematically address this concern.

**Proposed Experiments to Evaluate Transferability:**

1. **Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Evaluation:** We will train aspect scoring models on individual PeerRead domains (e.g., ACL, NIPS, ICLR) and evaluate them on held-out domains, reporting performance degradation metrics. This will establish a clear transferability baseline.

2. **Few-Shot Adaptation Study:** Using target domain samples of varying sizes (10, 50, 100 reviews), we will measure how quickly performance recovers with in-domain fine-tuning. This tests practical adaptation scenarios.

3. **Multi-Domain vs. Single-Domain Training:** We'll compare models trained on all PeerRead domains jointly against domain-specific models, analyzing whether shared patterns improve generalization or if domain interference occurs.

4. **Out-of-Domain Stress Test:** We will evaluate our models on non-CS review datasets (e.g., ASAP-AC for biomedical reviews, if available) to test true out-of-domain generalization and identify failure modes.

**Ablations to Isolate Transfer Mechanisms:**

- **Aspect-Level Transfer Analysis:** We'll compute per-aspect transferability scores (e.g., "clarity" vs. "originality") to test the hypothesis that surface-level aspects transfer better than content-dependent ones.
  
- **Feature Space Probing:** Using activation patching and representation similarity analysis (e.g., CKA), we'll quantify how much the model's latent space shifts across domains and which layers are most domain-sensitive.

- **Vocabulary Overlap Study:** We'll ablate domain-specific terminology by masking technical terms and measuring performance change, testing if models rely on lexical shortcuts versus generalizable discourse patterns.

- **Architecture Scaling:** We'll compare transfer performance across model sizes (e.g., BERT-base vs. BERT-large) to see if larger models are more robust or more prone to overfitting to training domain idiosyncrasies.

**Mitigation Strategies to Explore:**

- **Domain-Adversarial Training:** Adding a domain classifier with gradient reversal to learn domain-invariant aspect representations.
- **Prompt-Based Domain Conditioning:** Prefixing reviews with domain identifiers during training to encourage domain-aware but aspect-focused representations.
- **Meta-Learning Setup:** Framing domain adaptation as a few-shot learning problem using MAML or similar approaches.

These experiments will produce a transferability matrix, identify which aspects are most portable, and yield actionable insights for building more robust review assistance systems. We believe this analysis will significantly strengthen the paper's contribution beyond the current single-domain evaluations.
