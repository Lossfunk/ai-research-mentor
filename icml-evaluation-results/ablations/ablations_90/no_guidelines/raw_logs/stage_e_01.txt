  The user is asking about the PeerRead dataset and specifically about the "probably-rejected" labels for arXiv papers. They want me to anticipate reviewer concerns about the validity of these labels and propose mitigations for the discussion section.

First, I need to understand what the PeerRead dataset is. I recall that PeerRead is a dataset of peer reviews, primarily from conferences like ICLR, and it includes arXiv papers that were "probably rejected" from these conferences. The key issue is that these papers were not actually submitted to the conferences (or at least not confirmed to be submitted), so the "rejected" label is inferred rather than observed.

Let me think about the specific concerns:

1. **Selection bias**: The papers on arXiv that look like submissions might not be representative of all submissions. Authors might post to arXiv after rejection, or they might post versions that are different from what was submitted.

2. **Label noise**: The "probably-rejected" label is probabilistic, not certain. Some papers might have been accepted but not published in the conference proceedings for various reasons (withdrawn, published elsewhere, etc.). Some might not have been submitted at all.

3. **Temporal issues**: The timing of arXiv submissions vs. conference deadlines might not align perfectly. A paper might be posted after the conference decision, making the inference invalid.

4. **Domain mismatch**: The arXiv papers might be from different domains or of different quality than actual submissions.

5. **Confirmation bias**: Researchers might be using these labels to train models, but the labels themselves are suspect.

6. **Ethical concerns**: Using inferred rejection status might stigmatize authors or papers unfairly.

Now, for mitigations in the discussion section:

1. **Acknowledge limitations**: Be transparent about the uncertainty in the labels.

2. **Sensitivity analysis**: Show results hold under different assumptions about label accuracy.

3. **Validation studies**: Manually verify a sample of labels.

4. **Alternative labeling strategies**: Compare with other approaches.

5. **Separate analysis**: Analyze "probably-rejected" vs. confirmed rejected separately.

6. **Confidence weighting**: Use probabilistic labels with uncertainty quantification.

7. **Temporal filtering**: Use strict temporal cutoffs to ensure valid inference.

8. **Author surveys**: Contact authors to verify submission status (though this has its own issues).

9. **Focus on relative differences**: Emphasize that while absolute numbers might be off, relative patterns are still meaningful.

10. **Multiple datasets**: Validate findings on datasets with confirmed labels.

Let me structure this into a clear, actionable response that would be suitable for a discussion section of a paper using this dataset.

I should also mention the specific methodology used to create these labels. From what I recall, the PeerRead dataset identifies "probably-rejected" papers by finding arXiv papers that:
- Appear around conference submission deadlines
- Have similar formatting/style to submissions
- Were not found in the conference proceedings

This is inherently noisy. Let me make sure I'm accurate about this.

The PeerRead dataset (Kang et al., 2018) includes reviews from conferences and also "probably-rejected" papers from arXiv. The methodology involves scraping arXiv for papers that look like conference submissions (based on timing, style, etc.) but don't appear in the proceedings.

Key concerns:
- False positives: Papers that were never submitted but look like they could have been
- False negatives: Papers that were submitted and rejected but don't fit the scraping criteria
- Temporal misalignment
- Version mismatch (arXiv version might be different from submitted version)

Mitigations should address these specific issues.

Let me draft a comprehensive response that covers:
1. The core validity concerns
2. Specific mitigations for the discussion section
3. How to frame these mitigations in academic language

I should be clear, specific, and actionable. The user wants this for a discussion section, so it should be written in a way that could be directly adapted or used as a template.

Here are anticipated reviewer concerns about the "probably-rejected" labels in PeerRead and concrete mitigations for your discussion section:

### **Core Validity Concerns**

1. **Label Uncertainty**: The "probably-rejected" designation is an *inferred* status, not ground truth. Papers may be false positives (never submitted) or false negatives (rejected but not captured).
2. **Selection Bias**: Authors self-select to post rejections on arXiv; these may be systematically different (e.g., higher quality, less controversial) than the true rejection pool.
3. **Temporal & Version Mismatch**: arXiv posting dates may lag conference decisions, and the uploaded version may differ from the submitted one.
4. **Domain Drift**: arXiv papers span broader topics than conference-specific submissions, creating distribution shift.

### **Mitigations for Discussion Section**

**1. Transparent Uncertainty Quantification**
- *Statement*: "We acknowledge that ~30% of 'probably-rejected' labels are estimated to be false positives based on manual validation (see Appendix). All results should be interpreted as correlational rather than causal."
- *Action*: Report confidence intervals using label noise-aware metrics (e.g., MSE with asymmetric noise models).

**2. Sensitivity Analysis**
- *Statement*: "Our key findings persist when restricting to high-confidence rejections (papers posted within 30 days of notification date) and when simulating 20% label corruption."
- *Action*: Include a robustness table showing model performance across label confidence thresholds.

**3. Stratified Validation**
- *Statement*: "We manually verified 200 random samples: 68% were confirmed rejections via author contact or public reviews; 15% were false positives (never submitted); 17% were ambiguous."
- *Action*: Report separate metrics on the validated subset and bootstrap confidence bounds.

**4. Temporal Guardrails**
- *Statement*: "We exclude papers posted >60 days after the conference notification date to minimize post-hoc arXiv submissions."
- *Action*: Document strict date-matching heuristics in methods and show results degrade without them.

**5. Emphasize Relative Over Absolute**
- *Statement*: "While absolute acceptance rate predictions are biased by label noise, the *relative* ranking of review dimensions (e.g., 'clarity' vs. 'originality') remains stable across validation subsets."
- *Action*: Focus analysis on comparative patterns rather than point estimates.

**6. Cross-Dataset Triangulation**
- *Statement*: "Findings replicated on the ICLR 2017-2018 subset with 100% verified labels (r=0.89, p<0.01), suggesting arXiv noise does not invalidate conclusions."
- *Action*: Validate key hypotheses on confirmed-label subsets when available.

**7. Ethical Caveat**
- *Statement*: "These labels should not be used to evaluate individual researchers. We release only aggregated statistics to avoid stigmatization."
- *Action*: Add a limitations paragraph on potential misuse.

### **Example Discussion Paragraph**

*"A limitation of our study is the use of inferred rejection status for arXiv papers. While we implemented temporal filters (±30 days) and formatting heuristics to minimize false positives, manual validation suggests ~15-20% noise remains (Appendix Table 4). However, our primary finding—that review helpfulness scores predict acceptance better than technical scores—holds across both high-confidence arXiv subsets (n=1,200) and the verified ICLR 2018 data (n=500). This robustness suggests label noise introduces bias toward the null rather than spurious associations. Future work could validate labels via author surveys, though response rates may introduce new selection biases."*

This approach preempts reviewer skepticism by acknowledging limitations while demonstrating empirical rigor.
