  The user is asking for a final submission checklist for a privacy-preserving NLP paper. They want:
1. Artifact requirements
2. Ethics statements
3. Timeline checkpoints before a deadline in six weeks

This is a research assistant task. I should provide a comprehensive, practical checklist tailored to privacy-preserving NLP specifically, since that has unique requirements.

Key considerations:
- Privacy-preserving NLP papers often have special requirements around code, data, and ethics
- Different venues (conferences, journals) have different requirements, but I should make this general enough to adapt
- The six-week timeline needs realistic checkpoints
- I should highlight specific things that are easy to miss for this subfield

Let me structure this as:
1. A master checklist organized by category (Content, Artifacts, Ethics, Documentation, Submission Mechanics)
2. A specific section on privacy-preserving NLP considerations
3. A 6-week timeline with weekly checkpoints

For privacy-preserving NLP specifically, I need to think about:
- Code for privacy-preserving methods (differential privacy, federated learning, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, etc.)
- Data handling - often can't share raw data, need synthetic data or detailed processing scripts
- Privacy guarantees - need formal statements, proofs, parameter settings
- Baselines - need to include non-private and private baselines
- Threat model - must be clearly defined
- Experimental validation of privacy claims
- Ethics considerations are paramount

Let me create a comprehensive checklist that covers:
- Paper content quality
- Artifact requirements (code, data, models)
- Ethics statements and privacy-specific documentation
- Submission mechanics (formatting, supplementary materials)
- Timeline with weekly goals

I'll make it actionable and specific to privacy-preserving NLP.

# Final Submission Checklist: Privacy-Preserving NLP Paper

**Deadline Countdown: 6 Weeks**  
*Tailored for privacy-preserving NLP with artifact and ethics emphasis*

---

## **I. Paper Content & Quality (Week 6: Final Polish)**

### Core Content
- [ ] **Privacy claims are precise and verifiable**: All DP guarantees (ε, δ), security parameters, or privacy metrics are explicitly stated with correct notation
- [ ] **Threat model is clearly defined**: Who are the adversaries? What can they observe? What is the trust model?
- [ ] **Baselines include both non-private AND private alternatives**: At least one standard non-private baseline and one privacy-preserving baseline (e.g., DP-SGD vs. non-DP, or different ε values)
- [ ] **Privacy-utility tradeoffs are quantified**: Tables/figures show performance across multiple privacy budgets (ε values) or security parameters
- [ ] **Formal definitions included**: DP, secure MPC, or federated learning definitions match your implementation; include proof sketches in appendix if needed
- [ ] **Limitations section addresses privacy risks**: Explicitly state what your method does NOT protect against

### Writing & Presentation
- [ ] **Anonymous for double-blind review**: Remove author names, affiliations, GitHub links, and self-references; use third-person for citations
- [ ] **Supplementary material is cited in main text**: "See Appendix A for privacy proofs" or "Code in supplementary materials"
- [ ] **All figures are readable in grayscale**: Reviewers may print in black & white
- [ ] **Check for deanonymization risks in examples**: Ensure synthetic examples don't leak real data patterns

---

## **II. Artifact Requirements (Critical for Privacy-Preserving NLP)**

### Code Repository
- [ ] **Complete implementation provided**: All privacy mechanisms (DP noise, encryption, federated aggregation) are included, not just wrappers
- [ ] **Randomness is controlled**: Set seeds for all random number generators; document if cryptographic RNGs are required
- [ ] **Dependencies are pinned**: Exact versions of libraries (e.g., `opacus==1.4.0`, `tf-privacy==0.8.12`) in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`
- [ ] **Privacy accounting is reproducible**: Include code for computing privacy budgets (e.g., RDP accountant, moment accountant)
- [ ] **Synthetic data generator included**: If real data can't be shared, provide code that generates synthetic data with similar statistical properties
- [ ] **README with privacy-specific instructions**: How to verify DP guarantees, run security tests, or reproduce privacy experiments

### Data & Models
- [ ] **Data processing pipeline is complete**: Scripts for anonymization, tokenization, and privacy preprocessing included
- [ ] **Model checkpoints provided**: If space allows, include final models; otherwise, provide training logs with loss curves
- [ ] **No real sensitive data in repository**: Scrub all development data, logs, or config files that might contain PII
- [ ] **Data cards / model cards included**: Document intended use, privacy properties, and limitations (see Hugging Face templates)

### Verification Scripts
- [ ] **Privacy audit script**: Code that verifies ε-DP guarantees empirically (e.g., membership inference test, privacy curve reconstruction)
- [ ] **Attack implementation for evaluation**: If you evaluate against privacy attacks (MIA, reconstruction), include the attack code
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking script**: Reproduces all tables/figures with a single command

---

## **III. Ethics & Privacy Statements (Mandatory for This Subfield)**

### Ethics Statement Section
- [ ] **IRB approval documented**: If human data used, include approval number or exemption justification
- [ ] **Data source legality confirmed**: Confirm dataset licensing permits privacy research; mention GDPR/CCPA compliance steps
- [ ] **Potential misuse acknowledged**: Address how your technique could be used to hide model bias or enable malicious use
- [ ] **Environmental impact noted**: Privacy methods often have compute overhead; report energy costs if significant

### Broader Impact Statement
- [ ] **Privacy benefits quantified**: Who gains privacy? What is the magnitude of protection?
- [ ] **Equity implications addressed**: Does privacy protection disproportionately affect model performance for certain groups?
- [ ] **Dual-use risks assessed**: Could your privacy technique also protect malicious actors?

### Supplementary Ethics Documentation
- [ ] **Data Use Agreement (DUA) included**: If sharing derived data, include a DUA restricting re-identification attempts
- [ ] **Responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities**: If you discovered weaknesses in existing methods, have you notified authors? Is there a disclosure timeline?

---

## **IV. Submission Mechanics (Week 6: Final 48 Hours)**

### Formatting & Compliance
- [ ] **Page limit checked**: Main text + references + ethics statements; appendices usually don't count
- [ ] **Anonymization verified**: Search PDF for author names, emails, grant numbers; check metadata
- [ ] **License selected**: Choose appropriate license for artifacts (e.g., MIT for code, CC-BY for data)
- [ ] **Supplementary material size limit**: Check conference limit (often 50MB); compress large files
- [ ] **BibTeX cleaned**: No missing venues, page numbers, or arXiv links for published work

### Final Checks
- [ ] **Read the Call for Papers again**: Verify any privacy/artifact track-specific requirements
- [ ] **Link anonymization**: Use anonymous links (e.g., Anonymous GitHub) or promise code release after review
- [ ] **Contact program chairs**: If your privacy method requires special handling (e.g., cryptographic keys), email chairs now

## **VI. Privacy-Preserving NLP Red Flags**

**Check these NOW to avoid desk rejection:**
- [ ] **No "privacy for free" claims**: If you claim privacy with no utility loss, triple-check your threat model
- [ ] **ε values are reasonable**: ε < 1 is very private; ε > 10 is weak; justify your range
- [ ] **Composition is accounted for**: If you have multiple DP steps, privacy budget is composed correctly
- [ ] **Randomness is cryptographically secure**: Standard Python `random` is not secure; use `secrets` or crypto libraries
- [ ] **No hidden privacy violations**: Check that pre-trained embeddings or external APIs don't leak data

**Final Tip**: For privacy-preserving NLP, reviewers will scrutinize your ethics statement and artifacts more than typical NLP papers. A missing privacy proof or non-reproducible ε calculation is as serious as a missing SOTA comparison. When in doubt, disclose more.
