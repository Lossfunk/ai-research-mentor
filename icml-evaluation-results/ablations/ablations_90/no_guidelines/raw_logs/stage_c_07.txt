  The user wants a six-month plan for low-power computer vision tools to monitor coral reef health using volunteer divers. This is a research-oriented question that requires planning, technical knowledge, and practical considerations. Let me break this down:

Key components:
1. Low-power computer vision tools
2. Coral reef health monitoring
3. Volunteer divers (non-experts)
4. Six-month timeline

I need to design a comprehensive plan that covers:
- Technical development
- Training
- Field deployment
- Data collection
- Analysis
- Sustainability

Since this is a research assistant role, I should provide a structured, realistic plan that considers:
- Technical constraints (underwater environment, low-power requirements)
- Human factors (volunteer training, safety)
- Scientific validity (coral health metrics)
- Logistical challenges
- Timeline feasibility

I don't need to use any tools for this - it's a planning/design question that I can answer based on my knowledge. The current date is 2024-12-19, but that doesn't significantly impact this plan.

Let me structure this as a phased approach over 6 months:

Month 1: Planning & Design
Month 2: Hardware/Software Development
Month 3: Testing & Refinement
Month 4: Volunteer Training & Pilot
Month 5: Field Deployment
Month 6: Data Analysis & Future Planning

I should include specific details about:
- Computer vision models (efficient architectures for low-power)
- Hardware options (low-power cameras, processing units)
- Coral health indicators (bleaching, disease, coverage)
- Volunteer considerations (skill levels, safety, data quality)
- Power management strategies
- Data workflow

Let me create a comprehensive but practical plan.

Here's a six-month plan to develop and deploy low-power computer vision tools for volunteer-based coral reef monitoring:

---

### **Month 1: Requirements & System Design**

**Week 1-2: Define scientific targets**
- Identify 3-4 key coral health indicators: bleaching extent, algal overgrowth, disease lesions, and substrate composition
- Establish image quality standards (resolution, lighting, distance) for reliable classification
- Partner with marine biologists to create a labeled dataset of 5,000+ reference images

**Week 3-4: Hardware architecture**
- Select low-power platform: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (0.8W idle) or Coral Edge TPU (2W inference)
- Choose camera: Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 with underwater housing (avoids power-hungry processing)
- Design power system: 10,000mAh battery pack (~8 hours operation) with solar charging for surface intervals
- Develop prototype rig: Aluminum tray with handles, distance markers, and 45° angle guides for consistent photo geometry

---

### **Month 2: Software Development**

**Week 5-6: Model optimization**
- Train EfficientNetV2-S (1.8M parameters) on coral segmentation
- Quantize to INT8 format for Edge TPU (reduces power by 60%)
- Benchmark: <2W continuous inference, processing 1 frame/second
- Build offline-capable mobile app (React Native) for dive logging

**Week 7-8: Edge processing pipeline**
- Implement selective capture: only process images with >40% coral coverage (saves 70% storage/power)
- Add underwater white balance correction using color card detection
- Create dive-time data validation: real-time blur detection rejects poor images
- Develop compression: 1920x1080 JPEG at 85% quality (~300KB/image)

---

### **Month 3: Testing & Refinement**

**Week 9-10: Pool trials**
- Test system in controlled conditions: verify 6-hour continuous operation
- Calibrate distance markers: 0.5m and 1m quadrat frames for area estimation
- Validate model accuracy: target >85% agreement with expert annotations

**Week 11-12: Open-water validation**
- Conduct 5 test dives (10-15m depth) with research divers
- Measure power consumption under load: target <3W average
- Refine buoyancy and handling based on diver feedback
- Create troubleshooting guide for common issues (condensation, battery swaps)

---

### **Month 4: Volunteer Training & Pilot**

**Week 13-14: Training program**
- Develop 4-hour workshop: system operation, photo protocol, species ID basics
- Create certification: 20 practice photos with >80% protocol compliance
- Build online portal for dive planning and data upload
- Recruit 15-20 certified divers through dive clubs and conservation groups

**Week 15-16: Pilot deployment**
- Launch at 2-3 reef sites with known baseline data
- Each volunteer completes 3 supervised dives
- Collect 500+ validation images for model retraining
- Gather usability feedback: system weight (target <2kg), startup time (<30s)

---

### **Month 5: Full Field Deployment**

**Week 17-20: Data collection**
- Deploy kits to 10-15 volunteer teams
- Target: 50 dives/week, 200+ images/dive
- Implement quality control: automated screening removes 30-40% of images
- Track metrics: battery life, dive depth, GPS coordinates, water temperature
- Establish data sync: Wi-Fi upload at dive centers every 3 days

---

### **Month 6: Analysis & Sustainability**

**Week 21-22: Health mapping**
- Process collected imagery: generate benthic cover maps with uncertainty estimates
- Calculate site-level health scores: bleaching index, disease prevalence
- Compare results to historical surveys (if available)
- Build interactive dashboard for stakeholders

**Week 23-24: Future planning**
- Publish volunteer-collected dataset (CC BY-NC)
- Develop maintenance schedule: battery replacement every 2 years, housing seals every 6 months
- Create funding model: $500/unit hardware cost + $200/year maintenance
- Plan expansion: add fish population counting module, water quality sensor integration

### **Key Technical Specifications**

| Component | Power Draw | Runtime (10Ah) | Cost |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------|
| Edge TPU + Pi Zero | 2.5W | 16 hours | $120 |
| Camera module | 0.3W | Continuous | $35 |
| Dive housing | - | - | $180 |
| **Total system** | **<3W** | **8-10 dives** | **~$500** |

**Success Metrics:**
- 80% volunteer retention after 10 dives
- <10% data rejection rate
- Model drift <5% over 6 months
- Cost per survey: <$15 (vs. $200+ for professional surveys)

This plan prioritizes power efficiency through edge processing, volunteer-friendly design, and scientific rigor while keeping costs low enough for community-scale adoption.
