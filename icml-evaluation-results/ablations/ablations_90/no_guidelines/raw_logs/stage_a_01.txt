 The user wants to do research in AI but doesn't know where to start. This is a common question from beginners. I should provide a structured, actionable roadmap that covers:

1. Foundational knowledge needed
2. How to identify research interests
3. Practical steps to get started
4. Resources and tools
5. How to build a research portfolio
6. Community engagement

I should be encouraging but realistic about the effort required. I'll structure this as a step-by-step guide that progresses from basics to more advanced activities.

Key points to cover:
- Math and programming prerequisites
- Core AI/ML concepts
- Reading research papers
- Replicating experiments
- Finding a niche
- Getting involved in the community
- Potential pathways (academia, industry, independent)

I should avoid being overly prescriptive and instead offer multiple pathways since people have different backgrounds and goals. I'll also mention that "AI research" is broad and includes many subfields.

Let me create a comprehensive but digestible plan.

Starting AI research can feel overwhelming, but here's a practical roadmap to get you oriented and making progress:

## 1. Build Your Foundations (3-6 months)

**Math Essentials:**
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Calculus (derivatives, gradients)
- Probability & statistics
- *Resource:* Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra," or MIT OpenCourseWare

**Programming:**
- Python fluency
- PyTorch or TensorFlow basics
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- *Resource:* Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning course

**Core ML Knowledge:**
- Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course (Stanford/Coursera)
- Deep Learning Specialization
- Understand: supervised learning, neural networks, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs/Transformers

## 2. Immerse Yourself in the Literature

**Start reading papers regularly:**
- Begin with classic, foundational papers (e.g., AlexNet, ResNet, Attention Is All You Need)
- Use ArXiv Sanity Preserver to find trending papers
- Follow top conferences: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ACL
- **Key skill:** Learn to skim—read abstract, intro, figures, then conclusions before diving deep

**Practice reproduction:**
- Reimplement simple papers from scratch
- Start with GitHub repositories and try to understand every line
- Use Papers With Code to find implementations

## 3. Find Your Niche

AI research is vast. Explore subfields:
- **Deep Learning:** Architectures, optimization, theory
- **Computer Vision:** Object detection, generative models
- **NLP:** LLMs, reasoning, multilingual models
- **Robotics:** Control, simulation-to-real
- **AI Safety:** Alignment, interpretability, robustness
- **Efficiency:** Compression, quantization, edge AI

**How to choose:** Follow your curiosity. What problems excite you? What applications matter to you?

## 4. Get Hands-On Experience

**Mini-projects:**
- Don't wait for a "perfect" idea. Start small:
  - Implement a recent paper and test a variant
  - Analyze a model's failure modes
  - Create a benchmark for a specific scenario
- Document everything on GitHub with clear READMEs

**Contribute to open source:**
- Fix bugs in popular libraries
- Add features to research repositories
- Join communities like EleutherAI or Hugging Face

## 5. Join the Research Community

**Online:**
- Follow researchers on Twitter/X
- Join Discord/Slack communities (e.g., EleutherAI, Hugging Face)
- Subscribe to The Gradient, Import AI newsletters

**In-person (when possible):**
- Attend local meetups
- Volunteer at conferences
- Apply to research-focused internships

## 6. Create Your Research Portfolio

- **GitHub:** Clean, well-documented code for your projects
- **Blog:** Write accessible explanations of papers or your experiments (uses your own understanding)
- **Twitter/X:** Share interesting findings, engage with researchers

## 7. Formal Pathways (if applicable)

**If you're a student:**
- Take advanced ML courses
- Do a research project with a professor (even unpaid)
- Apply for undergraduate research programs (REUs, UROPs)

**If you're not in academia:**
- Industry research labs (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Research engineer roles
- Independent research (harder but possible—see communities like EleutherAI)

## 8. Your First "Real" Research Project

1. **Identify a problem:** Find a limitation in existing work (what do authors mention as future work?)
2. **Simple hypothesis:** "What if we changed X?"
3. **Quick experiment:** Test in < 2 weeks
4. **Iterate:** Most ideas fail; that's normal
5. **Write up:** Even negative results are valuable for learning

**Key Mindset Shifts:**
- **From student to researcher:** You're not just learning answers, you're asking questions
- **Embrace ignorance:** It's okay not to understand things—ask questions constantly
- **Persistence:** Research is 90% failure and confusion; the breakthroughs make it worthwhile

**Start this week:** Pick one paper from your subfield of interest, read it, and try to implement the simplest component. You'll learn more by doing than by planning.

What background do you have (student, professional, field of study)? I can give more specific guidance.
