  The user wants a conference-ready slide outline for a trustworthy LLM evaluation paper. This is a common structure for research presentations. I should create a clear, professional outline that highlights:

1. Contributions - what makes their work novel/important
2. Limitations - honest assessment of current work
3. Future work - next steps and open problems

Since I don't have the specific paper details, I need to create a general but comprehensive template that would work for a trustworthy LLM evaluation paper. I should make it adaptable and include typical elements found in such papers.

Key aspects of trustworthy LLM evaluation typically include:
- Bias detection
- Fairness metrics
- Robustness testing
- Interpretability
- Safety alignment
- Factuality/hallucination detection
- Privacy considerations
- Transparency

I'll structure this as a slide-by-slide outline with clear bullet points. The tone should be professional and suitable for a conference presentation (e.g., NeurIPS, FAccT, ACL, ICLR).

Let me create a template that covers:
- Title slide
- Motivation/Problem
- Related work (brief)
- Methodology/Approach
- Key Contributions (highlighted)
- Results (brief mention)
- Limitations
- Future Work
- Conclusion

I'll make the contributions section particularly strong and detailed since that's what the user emphasized. The limitations should be honest but framed constructively. Future work should be specific and actionable.

I should use clear, concise language that would work for oral presentation slides - short bullet points, not paragraphs. I'll also add speaker notes suggestions where helpful.

Let me create a comprehensive but flexible outline.

Here is a conference-ready slide outline for your trustworthy LLM evaluation paper. Adapt the bracketed placeholders to your specific work:

---

### **Slide 1: Title**
**Title:** "Towards Trustworthy Evaluation of Large Language Models: [Your Specific Approach/Metric Suite]"  
**Authors:** [Your names]  
**Affiliations:** [Institutions]  
**Contact:** [Email/project page QR code]

---

### **Slide 2: The Trustworthiness Gap**
- **Problem:** Existing LLM evals focus on accuracy, not trustworthiness dimensions
- **Gap:** No unified framework for measuring [bias/fairness/robustness/interpretability] holistically
- **Consequence:** Deployed LLMs exhibit [harmful biases/catastrophic failures/opaque decisions] despite high benchmark scores
- **Our Vision:** Systematic evaluation that aligns with human values and safety requirements

---

### **Slide 3: Key Contributions (HIGHLIGHT SLIDE)**
**✦ Contribution 1:** Novel evaluation framework integrating [X] trustworthiness dimensions  
 → Enables multi-dimensional scoring and trade-off analysis

**✦ Contribution 2:** [Your Methodology] - [e.g., Counterfactual perturbation suite / Adversarial social bias probes / Causal interpretability pipeline]  
 → Reveals failure modes missed by existing benchmarks (e.g., 40% drop in fairness under distribution shift)

**✦ Contribution 3:** Comprehensive evaluation of [X] leading LLMs across [Y] tasks  
 → First systematic analysis of trustworthiness trade-offs at scale

**✦ Contribution 4:** Open-source toolkit & dataset with [Z] test cases  
 → Enables reproducible audits by practitioners

---

### **Slide 4: Methodology at a Glance**
- **Framework Architecture:** [Diagram showing components: Input Generator → Perturbation Engine → LLM → Trustworthiness Analyzer → Dashboard]
- **Key Innovation:** [Your technical approach - keep it visual]
- **Evaluation Dimensions:** Bias, Robustness, Interpretability, Privacy, Safety
- **Scale:** Tested on [X] models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama-2, etc.) with [Y] prompts

---

### **Slide 5: Key Results (One impactful finding)**
- **Main Result:** [E.g., "All models show >30% fairness degradation under adversarial social perturbations"]
- **Surprising Finding:** [E.g., "Larger models are more susceptible to targeted bias amplification"]
- **Visualization:** [Show one compelling figure - radar chart of trustworthiness scores or failure mode heatmap]

---

### **Slide 6: Limitations (Honest & Constructive)**
**✧ Scope Limitations:**
- Evaluated only [English/text-only/XX tasks] - multilingual/multimodal extension needed
- Focus on [specific bias types] - other dimensions (environmental impact, long-term safety) not covered

**✧ Methodological Limitations:**
- Perturbation space is manually curated - could miss emergent failure modes
- Trustworthiness scores rely on [proxy metrics] - correlation with real-world harm requires validation
- Computational cost: [X] GPU hours per model - limits frequent re-evaluation

**✧ Fundamental Challenges:**
- Ground truth for "trustworthiness" is socially situated and evolving
- Trade-off between comprehensive evaluation and practical deployability

---

### **Slide 7: Future Work (Actionable & Visionary)**
**Immediate (6 months):**
- Extend to multilingual contexts (pilot on [Spanish/Chinese])
- Integrate human-in-the-loop validation for failure mode severity
- Develop lightweight version for CI/CD integration

**Medium-term (1-2 years):**
- Dynamic trustworthiness monitoring across model versions
- Community-driven adversarial test case repository
- Standardized trustworthiness reporting template for model cards

**Long-term Vision:**
- **Call to Action:** Establish "Trustworthiness Audit" as pre-deployment requirement
- Research direction: Causal frameworks linking evaluation metrics to downstream harm
- Policy implication: Advocate for regulatory adoption of multi-dimensional evaluation

---

### **Slide 8: Takeaway Message**
- **For Researchers:** Trustworthiness evaluation is tractable and necessary - use our framework
- **For Practitioners:** Don't trust accuracy alone - audit models across our [X] dimensions
- **For Community:** [Your toolkit] enables reproducible LLM auditing - join us in building comprehensive benchmarks

### **Speaker Notes Tips:**
- **Slide 3 (Contributions):** Spend 2-3 minutes here. Emphasize what *wasn't* possible before your work.
- **Slide 6 (Limitations):** Frame as "These are the next problems we're tackling" to show intellectual honesty.
- **Slide 7 (Future Work):** End with the community call-to-action to leave a lasting impression.
- Keep each slide to ≤6 bullet points; use the outline as talking points, not text to read verbatim.
