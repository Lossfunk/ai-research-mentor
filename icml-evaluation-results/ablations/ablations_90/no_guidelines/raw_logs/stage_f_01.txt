  The user is asking for two things:
1. Recommend top venues for a 6-month compressible LLMs project
2. Simulate a brief reviewer summary for such a project

Let me break this down:

**Part 1: Top Venues**
The project is about "compressible LLMs" - this likely involves model compression techniques for Large Language Models (e.g., pruning, quantization, distillation, efficient architectures). The timeline is 6 months, which is relatively short, so we need to consider:
- Conference deadlines that fit this timeline
- Appropriate impact/prestige level
- Relevance to the topic

Key venues would include:
- **ML/DL conferences**: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR
- **NLP conferences**: ACL, EMNLP, NAACL
- **Efficiency/Systems venues**: MLSys, MobiSys (for edge deployment), ISCA, MICRO (for hardware)
- **Specialized workshops**: Various efficiency workshops at major conferences

Given the 6-month timeline, I should consider:
- Current date is 2024-12-19
- Typical conference cycles (many have deadlines in Feb-May for conferences in late 2025)
- Workshop deadlines are often more flexible

**Part 2: Reviewer Summary**
I need to simulate a brief reviewer summary that would be typical for such a project. This should include:
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Overall assessment
- Common review criteria: novelty, technical quality, experimental rigor, clarity, impact

The "ethics and formatting constraints" mentioned likely refer to:
- Not recommending predatory venues
- Being realistic about acceptance chances
- Following standard academic review formats
- Avoiding hyperbole

Let me structure my response:

1. First, provide venue recommendations categorized by type and timeline
2. For each venue, give details about:
   - Typical focus areas relevant to compressible LLMs
   - Approximate deadlines given the 6-month timeline
   - Acceptance rates/prestige
   - Why it's a good fit
3. Then provide a simulated reviewer summary that covers:
   - The core idea of compressible LLMs
   - Typical evaluation criteria
   - A balanced review (not overly positive or negative)
   - Include common reviewer talking points (novelty, baselines, ablations, etc.)

I should be specific about dates. Since today is December 19, 2024, a 6-month project would be completed around June 2025. So I should look for venues with deadlines after that period.

Let me think about specific conferences:
- **NeurIPS 2025**: Deadline likely May 2025, conference Dec 2025 - fits perfectly
- **ICML 2025**: Deadline likely Feb 2025 - might be tight but doable
- **ICLR 2025**: Deadline already passed (Oct 2024) - not relevant
- **ACL 2025**: Deadline likely Jan/Feb 2025 - tight but possible
- **EMNLP 2025**: Deadline likely June 2025 - perfect timing
- **MLSys 2025**: Deadline likely Dec 2025/Jan 2026 - too late
- **NAACL 2025**: Deadline likely Dec 2024 - too soon

Workshops are more flexible and often have deadlines 1-2 months before the main conference.

For the reviewer summary, I should create a realistic critique that touches on:
- Motivation and relevance
- Technical approach (e.g., pruning, quantization, architectural changes)
- Experimental setup (models used, benchmarks, baselines)
- Results and significance
- Limitations and concerns
- Overall recommendation

I'll make it balanced - not a clear accept or reject, but a borderline paper that would be typical, maybe leaning towards weak accept.

Let me also mention ethics constraints explicitly - no predatory venues, be realistic about expectations, mention dual-use concerns of LLM compression.

Formatting constraints: I'll use clear headings, bullet points, and a structured format that's easy to read.

Here are top-tier venue recommendations for a 6-month compressible LLMs project, with a simulated reviewer summary:

---

### **Primary Conference Targets (Dec 2024 + 6 months = June 2025 completion)**

**1. EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)**
- **Deadline**: ~June 2025 (exact: likely early June)
- **Fit**: Excellent for compression-aware training, efficient architectures, or pruning/distillation methods with NLP evaluations
- **Impact**: High (CORE A*). Strong industry/academic visibility
- **Note**: Requires thorough linguistic task evaluation (GLUE, SuperGLUE, etc.)

**2. NeurIPS 2025**
- **Deadline**: Mid-May 2025
- **Fit**: Perfect for fundamental compression theory, novel optimization, or hardware-aware methods
- **Impact**: Highest tier. Very competitive (~25% acceptance)
- **Note**: Emphasize theoretical contributions or surprising empirical insights

**3. MLSys 2026**
- **Deadline**: ~December 2025
- **Fit**: Ideal if focusing on deployment, inference systems, or hardware-software co-design
- **Impact**: High and growing. Systems community values reproducibility
- **Note**: 6-month project can mature into strong systems paper by Dec

**4. ACL 2025 Findings**
- **Deadline**: Same as ACL main (~Feb 2025) - *tight but feasible*
- **Fit**: Good for applied compression methods with solid NLP benchmarks
- **Impact**: High visibility, slightly lower bar than main conference
- **Note**: Good fallback if main conference deadline is missed

---

### **Workshop Targets (Faster turnaround, high impact)**

**5. Efficient Natural Language and Speech Processing (ENLSP) @ NeurIPS/ICML**
- **Deadline**: ~1 month before main conference
- **Fit**: Perfect match. Dedicated to efficient models
- **Impact**: Strong industry presence, good for early-stage work

**6. Tiny Papers @ ICLR/NeurIPS**
- **Deadline**: Rolling/flexible
- **Fit**: For concise, focused contributions (e.g., a novel pruning criterion)
- **Impact**: Emerging venue, good for quick dissemination

---

### **Ethics & Formatting Constraints**

- **Avoid**: Predatory journals (check Beall's List), overclaiming "SOTA without proper baselines"
- **Required**: 
  - Report exact model sizes, FLOPs, and wall-clock latency
  - Include ablations for each compression component
  - Discuss environmental impact (both positive from efficiency, negative from training)
  - Address dual-use risks: compressed models enable malicious use on commodity hardware
  - Use official LaTeX templates; no page overruns
  - Release code and minimal model checkpoints

### **Simulated Reviewer Summary**

```
REVIEWER #2 (Weak Accept, Score: 6/10)

Summary: This paper proposes "LayerDrop-Quant," a joint structured pruning 
and quantization framework for compressing LLMs. The method prunes 30% of 
transformer layers using a novel importance score based on attention entropy, 
then applies 4-bit AWQ quantization. Experiments on Llama-2 7B show 2.1x 
speedup with <2% perplexity increase on WikiText-103.

Strengths:
- Practical motivation for edge deployment is clear
- Joint optimization is technically sound; the entropy-based importance metric 
  is novel and well-motivated
- Comprehensive ablation study (Table 3) isolates pruning vs. quantization gains
- Code is well-documented and reproducible

Weaknesses:
- Baselines outdated: omits recent methods like SliceGPT and ShortGPT
- Evaluation limited to perplexity; no downstream task performance (MMLU, etc.)
- No hardware measurements (only theoretical FLOPs reduction)
- The "6-month" timeline is evident: limited model scale (only 7B) and 
  dataset variety
- Ethics statement is generic; doesn't address amplification of biases in 
  compressed models

Concerns:
- The attention entropy heuristic may not generalize to encoder-decoder models
- Figure 2 is unclear; error bars missing in Table 2

Overall: A solid engineering contribution with modest novelty. The method 
is practical and well-evaluated on basic metrics, but lacks the breadth 
required for a strong accept. Accept as a short paper if space permits.

**Timeline Advice**: Start with ENLSP workshop (June-July 2025) for feedback, then expand experiments for EMNLP or NeurIPS main conference. This respects the 6-month constraint while maximizing impact.
