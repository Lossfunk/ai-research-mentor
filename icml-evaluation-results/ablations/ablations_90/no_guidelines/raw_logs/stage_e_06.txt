  The user is asking about the PeerRead paper's labeling process being underpowered for newer venues, and wants help articulating how this affects generalizability and proposing a concrete follow-up experiment to reassure reviewers.

First, I need to recall what the PeerRead paper is. PeerRead is a dataset and study about automated review prediction. The paper is "PeerRead: A Dataset of Peer Reviews for Research Paper Evaluation" by Kang et al. (2018). It collected reviews from top-tier venues like ACL, NIPS/NeurIPS, ICLR, etc., but for newer venues, they had fewer samples.

The labeling process refers to how they labeled reviews as "positive" or "negative" or perhaps how they scored them. I need to check the details of the PeerRead paper to understand the exact labeling methodology and the power issues.

Let me search for the PeerRead paper details.
