  The user is asking for a venue-specific submission plan for a robotics safety paper. This is a detailed request that involves:
1. Identifying appropriate venues for robotics safety research
2. Detailing supplemental video requirements
3. Artifact checklists
4. Ethical review steps

I need to provide a comprehensive, actionable plan. Since the user didn't specify a particular venue, I should probably cover multiple top-tier venues that are relevant to robotics safety. The most relevant venues would be:
- ICRA (IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation)
- IROS (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)
- RSS (Robotics: Science and Systems)
- HRI (Human-Robot Interaction)
- Maybe some systems venues like OSDI, SOSP, or safety-specific venues

Let me structure this response to be maximally useful. I'll create a detailed plan that covers:
1. Venue selection strategy with specific examples
2. For each major venue, the specific requirements for:
   - Supplemental video
   - Artifact evaluation
   - Ethical review
3. A timeline/checklist for preparation
4. General best practices

I should be specific and provide actual details about these venues' requirements. Let me recall what I know about these conferences:

**ICRA**:
- Hosted by IEEE
- Does have supplemental material requirements
- Typically allows video submissions
- Has an ethical review process for papers involving human subjects, animals, or potentially harmful research
- Artifacts: Not as formalized as systems conferences, but increasingly encouraging reproducibility

**IROS**:
- Similar to ICRA
- IEEE/RSJ conference
- Allows multimedia attachments
- Ethical considerations are important
- Has had reproducibility initiatives

**RSS**:
- More academically focused
- Strong emphasis on rigorous evaluation
- Has artifact evaluation process
- Ethical review is mandatory for certain types of research
- Video requirements are specific

**HRI**:
- Very focused on human subjects
- Strict ethical review requirements
- Video is crucial since it involves human-robot interaction
- Detailed consent requirements for video

I should also mention journals like:
- IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)
- Science Robotics
- Nature Machine Intelligence

Let me create a comprehensive plan. I'll structure it as:

1. **Venue Selection Matrix** - to help choose the right venue
2. **Venue-Specific Requirements** - detailed breakdown for top 3-4 venues
3. **Supplemental Video Requirements** - general and specific
4. **Artifact Checklist** - detailed
5. **Ethical Review Steps** - comprehensive
6. **Timeline and Action Plan** - practical checklist

This will give the user a complete, actionable plan.

## 8. Final Recommendations

**For a robotics safety paper, I recommend:**
1. **Primary target:** RSS 2025 - highest rigor for safety claims, mandatory artifacts
2. **Backup:** ICRA 2025 - broader audience, strong industry relevance
3. **If human-focused:** HRI 2025 - but start ethical review NOW (12+ weeks)

**Start preparing:**
- **Video:** 6 weeks before deadline (requires multiple takes)
- **Artifacts:** 8 weeks before (needs testing on clean systems)
- **Ethics:** 12 weeks before (IRB is the long pole)

**Key Contact:** Email the venue's Program Chair 4 weeks before deadline with any ethical uncertainties—they're increasingly responsive to safety-related queries.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific venue or create a customized timeline based on your paper's focus (e.g., formal verification vs. human-robot interaction)?
