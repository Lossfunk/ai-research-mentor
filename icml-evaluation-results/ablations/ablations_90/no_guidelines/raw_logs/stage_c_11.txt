  The user is asking for help crafting a cross-lab collaboration plan for evaluating large-scale climate model downscaling with uncertainty quantification. This is a complex research topic that involves multiple aspects:

1. **Climate Model Downscaling**: This is the process of taking large-scale climate model outputs (from GCMs - Global Climate Models) and translating them to finer spatial scales, which is crucial for local/regional climate impact assessments.

2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: This involves characterizing and quantifying uncertainties at each step of the modeling chain - from GCM structure, emissions scenarios, downscaling methods, to observational data.

3. **Cross-lab Collaboration**: This implies multiple research groups working together, which requires clear coordination, division of labor, data sharing protocols, etc.

4. **Evaluation**: This means systematically assessing the performance of downscaling methods, likely against observations, and characterizing the uncertainties.

I need to create a comprehensive but practical collaboration plan. Since I don't have access to specific tools that would help with this (like searching for existing collaboration frameworks or specific climate modeling resources), I'll rely on my knowledge of climate science, research collaboration best practices, and uncertainty quantification methods.

Key elements to include:
- **Project Structure & Governance**: Leadership, decision-making, communication
- **Scientific Objectives**: Clear research questions
- **Methodological Framework**: Downscaling methods to compare, UQ approaches
- **Data Management**: Sharing, standards, storage
- **Division of Labor**: Which labs do what based on expertise
- **Timeline & Milestones**: Phased approach
- **Outputs & Deliverables**: Papers, datasets, tools
- **Risk Management**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

I should structure this as a practical, actionable plan that research labs could adapt. I'll make it detailed enough to be useful but flexible enough to accommodate different institutional contexts.

Let me think about the specific components:

**Scientific Scope**: Should focus on key research questions like:
- How do different downscaling methods compare across regions/variables?
- How do uncertainties propagate through the downscaling chain?
- What is the added value of downscaling relative to GCM biases?

**Downscaling Methods**: Could include:
- Dynamical downscaling (RCMs)
- Statistical downscaling (SDMs) - various types
- Deep learning/emerging methods
- Hybrid approaches

**Uncertainty Sources**: Should consider:
- GCM ensemble spread (structural uncertainty)
- RCP/SSP scenario uncertainty
- Downscaling method uncertainty
- Internal variability
- Observational uncertainty

**Evaluation Framework**: Need:
- Metrics (bias, RMSE, correlation, skill scores)
- Benchmarking against observations
- Perfect prognosis vs. model output statistics
- Temporal/spatial scales

**Collaboration Structure**: Should address:
- Lead institution vs. partners
- Working groups
- Data protocols
- Authorship policies
- Meeting schedules

I'll create a modular plan that can be scaled up or down depending on the number of labs and resources available. I'll also include specific examples to make it concrete.

The plan should be:
- **Comprehensive**: Covering all major aspects
- **Actionable**: With specific tasks and timelines
- **Flexible**: Adaptable to different contexts
- **Realistic**: Acknowledging constraints and challenges

I'll organize it into sections: Executive Summary, Objectives, Governance, Technical Framework, Work Packages, Data Management, Timeline, Outputs, and Risk Management.

This should provide a solid foundation for the user to build upon for their specific collaboration.

Here's a comprehensive cross-lab collaboration plan for evaluating climate model downscaling with uncertainty quantification:

---

## **Cross-Lab Collaboration Plan: Climate Downscaling Evaluation & Uncertainty Quantification**

### **1. Project Architecture & Governance**

**Steering Committee (1 rep per lab)**
- Meets monthly to coordinate priorities and resolve conflicts
- Rotating chair (annual) from different labs
- Decides on method inclusion criteria and evaluation standards

**Working Groups** (3-4 labs per group, overlapping membership encouraged)
- **WG1: Dynamical Downscaling** (RCM evaluation)
- **WG2: Statistical Downscaling** (SDM intercomparison)
- **WG3: Machine Learning Methods** (emerging techniques)
- **WG4: Uncertainty Propagation** (UQ frameworks)
- **WG5: Observations & Benchmarking** (validation data)

**Communication Protocol**
- Slack/Teams channel for daily coordination
- Bi-weekly video WG meetings
- Quarterly all-hands symposium (virtual/hybrid)
- Shared project management board (Asana/Jira)

---

### **2. Core Scientific Framework**

**Evaluation Domains** (select 2-3 for depth):
- **Geographic**: Choose 3-5 diverse regions (e.g., Western US, European Alps, Southeast Asia, East Africa)
- **Variables**: Temperature (min/max), precipitation (mean/extremes), wind, humidity
- **Timescales**: Daily for extremes, monthly for means, seasonal for impacts
- **Periods**: Historical (1980-2010), mid-century (2040-2060), end-century (2070-2100)

**Downscaling Methods to Evaluate**:
1. **Dynamical**: WRF, RegCM, RCA4 (10-50 km → 1-5 km)
2. **Statistical**: BCSD, QM, ANOGV, weather generators
3. **Machine Learning**: CNN-based super-resolution, GANs, Emulators
4. **Hybrid**: Combined dynamical-statistical approaches

**Uncertainty Sources to Quantify**:
- **GCM structural**: 6-10 CMIP6 models spanning climate sensitivity range
- **Scenario**: SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5 (minimum)
- **Internal variability**: 10-member ensembles where possible
- **Downscaling method**: All methods applied to same GCM inputs
- **Observational**: Multiple gridded products (ERA5, CHIRPS, Daymet, local stations)

- Provide dynamical downscaled ensembles
- Lead WG1

**Lab B (Statistical Methods)**
