The user wants to adapt a Hierarchical Transformer to healthcare dialogue data. I need to:
1. Assess what this likely means (they probably mean a hierarchical model for multi-turn conversations)
2. Identify the key challenges specific to healthcare dialogue
3. Give concrete, actionable changes needed
4. Cover evaluation and ethics properly

Key issues I see:
- Healthcare dialogue has privacy constraints (PHI)
- Clinical accuracy is critical - can't hallucinate
- Hierarchical structure needs to handle speaker roles (doctor/patient)
- Evaluation needs clinical validity, not just BLEU
- IRB is mandatory for any real patient data

I should be direct about what's hard and what won't work.

This is a high-risk adaptation that will fail without major changes. Here's what you actually need:

**Architecture Changes:**
Your standard hierarchical attention won't capture clinical roles. Add explicit speaker embeddings for doctor/patient/system turns. The patient history encoder needs medical ontology integration (SNOMED CT/ICD embeddings) - without this, you're just doing generic dialogue. Most importantly: **add a clinical fact-checking head** that verifies generated responses against the patient's stated symptoms/medications. Healthcare models that hallucinate kill people.

**Preprocessing:**
Raw dialogue transcripts are useless. You need structured annotation of:
- Clinical entities (medications, symptoms, diagnoses)
- Dialogue acts with clinical intent (history-taking vs. treatment recommendation)
- Temporal markers (symptom onset, medication changes)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
BLEU/ROUGE are clinically meaningless. Your primary metrics must be:
- **Clinical accuracy**: % of statements that are medically valid given patient history (requires physician annotation)
- **Safety**: Rate of harmful recommendations (target: <0.1%)
- **Task completion**: Did it gather needed history? Did it provide appropriate next steps?

**IRB/Ethics:**
You cannot use real patient dialogue without IRB approval - full stop. Even de-identification often fails for dialogues (dates, rare diseases, voice patterns). You'll likely need:
- IRB protocol for data use
- Business Associate Agreement if using vendor data
- FDA considerations if this touches diagnosis/treatment (SaMD classification)

**Comparable Results:**
You won't be comparable to general dialogue models. Publish on clinical benchmarks (MeDAL, CASI) instead. The field expects lower BLEU scores but higher clinical validity.

**Bottom line:** If you don't have clinical collaborators and IRB access, pick a different project. This isn't a dataset you can download and run experiments on.
