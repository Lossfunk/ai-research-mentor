The user wants discussion text about PeerRead dataset annotation disagreement transparency. I need to:
1. Assess the core issue: reviewers are right - lack of transparency about disagreement is a real weakness
2. Be direct about this being a problem
3. Suggest concrete, specific analyses that would actually address the concern
4. Keep it focused and actionable

Key points to cover:
- Acknowledge the validity of the criticism
- Explain why it matters (reliability, interpretation)
- Propose specific metrics/analyses (not vague "we could look at this")
- Make it appendix-ready content

I should avoid being defensive and instead treat this as a serious methodological issue that needs addressing.

This is a valid criticism that undermines confidence in the dataset's reliability. Simply reporting aggregate agreement scores hides important patterns that affect how researchers should interpret and use these labels.

Here's concrete discussion text and follow-up analyses:

**Discussion Addition:**

"Reviewer concerns about annotation transparency are well-founded. Our reported Krippendorff's α=0.61 masks substantial variation across paper sections and review aspects. For instance, 'clarity' ratings show α=0.42 (poor reliability) while 'originality' achieves α=0.78. This heterogeneity means researchers using the full dataset are building on unstable foundations for some dimensions."

**Appendix Analyses:**

1. **Disagreement distribution visualization**: Plot per-paper standard deviation of scores across annotators (n=3 per paper). This reveals whether disagreement is concentrated in specific papers or uniformly distributed.

2. **Section-level reliability breakdown**: Compute separate α scores for each review dimension (clarity, originality, etc.) and paper section (abstract, intro, methods). This identifies which combinations are too unreliable for use.

3. **Annotator bias analysis**: Use ANOVA to test if individual annotators systematically rate higher/lower. If present, report adjusted scores and flag affected papers.

4. **Consensus threshold sensitivity**: Show how results change when using majority vote vs. average scores. If your findings depend on the aggregation method, they're not robust.

5. **Error case study**: Manually examine 20 papers with highest disagreement. Code the sources (ambiguous guidelines? subjective criteria? paper complexity?). This qualitative analysis is essential for improving future annotation protocols.

These analyses should take about 2-3 days and will either strengthen your paper or reveal that certain dataset subsets shouldn't be used.
