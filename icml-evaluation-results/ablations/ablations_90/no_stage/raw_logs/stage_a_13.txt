The user wants to get into AI-for-health research but lacks datasets. This is a practical problem. My honest assessment: this is a real barrier, but there are concrete ways forward. I need to be direct about what's viable vs. what's not, and give them a clear path.

Key points to cover:
- Dataset scarcity is a real issue, not just their problem
- Some approaches are dead ends (trying to scrape medical data)
- Better alternatives exist: public datasets, collaborations, methodology work
- Need to be specific about what actually works

I should avoid listing 10 options. Pick the 2-3 most viable paths and explain why they're better than others.

You can absolutely do meaningful AI-for-health research without your own datasets, but you need to be strategic about it.

**The reality:** Most health data is locked behind privacy walls, and scraping/collecting it yourself is both unethical and impractical. Don't waste time on that.

**What actually works:**

1. **Start with public benchmarks.** MIMIC-III (ICU data) and CheXpert (chest X-rays) are gold standards. Build something better on these and you'll have a paper. The key is *methodological innovation*—new architectures, uncertainty quantification, or fairness improvements—not just incremental accuracy gains.

2. **Partner with clinicians.** Find a professor or hospital researcher who has data but lacks AI expertise. Offer to do the modeling work while they handle ethics/IRB. This is how most health AI gets done. Cold-email clinical researchers with concrete ideas, not just "I want to work on AI."

3. **Focus on methodology that generalizes.** Work on domain adaptation, few-shot learning, or federated learning methods that *help others* use their data better. These papers don't require your own dataset but are highly valued.

**What won't work:** Trying to scrape medical data, using synthetic data alone (reviewers will torch it), or vague proposals without a specific clinical collaborator.

Pick one path and go deep. Which direction sounds most feasible for your situation?
