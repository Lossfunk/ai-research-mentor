The user is asking about novelty of hybrid quantum-classical pipelines for protein design. I need to assess:
1. Is this actually a fresh idea or already crowded?
2. What's the current state of the field?
3. What would make it novel vs. incremental?

I should be direct about whether this is promising or not, and why. The key is to evaluate the actual novelty and feasibility, not just be encouraging.

Let me think about the landscape:
- Classical ML for protein design is extremely crowded (AlphaFold, RFdiffusion, etc.)
- Quantum computing for chemistry/biology has been explored but is still early
- Hybrid quantum-classical is a common framing but actual implementations for protein design specifically?

The critical question: what's the quantum part actually doing that classical can't? Without a clear answer, this is just buzzword stacking.

This is likely a weak idea unless you have a very specific quantum advantage in mind.

The field isn't just crowded—it's saturated with classical methods that actually work (RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, etc.). "Hybrid quantum-classical" is a common buzzword framing, but most proposals collapse under scrutiny because they don't articulate what the quantum component does that couldn't be done classically.

**The critical flaw:** If you're thinking "quantum for better energy calculations" or "quantum for sampling," you need to show that:
1. The quantum part solves a *specific* bottleneck that classical methods can't
2. You have access to hardware that can actually run it at relevant scales
3. It's not just slower and more expensive with no clear benefit

**What would make this fresh:** A concrete, testable hypothesis about quantum advantage. For example: "Quantum annealing can sample rare backbone conformations that MCMC gets stuck on, and I'll demonstrate this on [specific protein class] where classical methods fail."

Without that specificity, reviewers will dismiss it as quantum hype layered onto a solved problem. Figure out your actual quantum value proposition first—if you can't articulate it in one sentence, the idea isn't ready.
