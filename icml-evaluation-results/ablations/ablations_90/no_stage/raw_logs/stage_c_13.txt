The user wants a detailed plan for evaluating fairness-aware recommendation algorithms for small e-commerce stores in emerging markets. This is a specific technical request, not a vague question. I need to:

1. Assess if this is a good research direction
2. Provide a concrete evaluation plan
3. Be critical about potential pitfalls

Key concerns:
- "Small e-commerce stores" = limited data, computational resources
- "Emerging markets" = unique fairness considerations (digital divide, infrastructure gaps)
- "Fairness-aware" = which fairness definition? Multiple stakeholders?
- Evaluation needs to be practical for resource-constrained settings

I should lead with my assessment, then give a focused plan. The plan should be detailed but not a dump of frameworks. I'll structure it around the core evaluation challenges specific to this context.

This is a promising direction but needs careful scoping. Most fairness research assumes Amazon-scale data and infrastructure, which won't transfer to small stores in emerging markets. Your evaluation plan must address data scarcity, computational constraints, and locally relevant fairness definitions.

**Core Evaluation Framework:**

1. **Define fairness for this context** (not US-centric definitions). Focus on:
   - **Seller-side**: Preventing large sellers from dominating recommendations (critical for marketplace health)
   - **Buyer-side**: Ensuring new/low-income users get quality suggestions despite sparse history
   - **Infrastructure-aware**: Algorithms must run on low-end servers with <100ms latency

2. **Dataset strategy**: Don't rely on public datasets (they're from mature markets). Create a benchmark from 5-10 actual small stores in your target region. Minimum: 3 months transaction data, user demographics, seller size tiers. Synthetic augmentation will be necessary for rare groups.

3. **Metrics that matter**: 
   - **Utility**: Conversion rate (not just accuracy@K)
   - **Seller fairness**: Gini coefficient of recommendation exposure across seller size tiers
   - **Buyer fairness**: Min/Max conversion rate across income quintiles
   - **Computational**: Training time on a $50/month VPS, inference latency on 2G connections

4. **Baselines**: Include non-neural methods (simple popularity + fairness constraints) that small stores could actually implement. Comparing against deep learning models they can't deploy is academically dishonest.

**First step**: Partner with 3 small stores and collect their data before designing algorithms. The evaluation plan is meaningless without understanding the actual data distribution and fairness concerns in your target market.
