The user wants help with two things for their interpretable medical imaging paper:
1. Artifact release notes
2. Reviewer response bullet points
And they want to ensure compliance with anonymization and patient data policies.

This is a specific, practical request. I need to give them concrete, actionable guidance that addresses both the content and the compliance aspects. I should be direct about what needs to be included and what pitfalls to avoid.

Key compliance issues for medical imaging:
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- De-identification standards
- IRB/ethics approval documentation
- Data use agreements
- Model cards / datasheets for datasets
- Reproducibility vs privacy tradeoffs

I should structure this clearly and not be vague. Let me give them the essential components for both deliverables.

**Artifact Release Notes**

Your release notes must explicitly state:
- **Data source**: "Dataset derived from [Institution] under IRB #XXXX, with HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification applied (removal of 18 identifiers per 45 CFR 164.514)"
- **Anonymization method**: "Faces scrubbed using [specific algorithm], metadata stripped, DICOM headers sanitized. Manual review by [N] radiologists confirmed no PHI"
- **Access controls**: "Available via Data Use Agreement requiring institutional sign-off and IRB approval at recipient site. No direct download"
- **Limitations**: "Re-identification risk: [assessment]. Not suitable for research requiring longitudinal patient tracking"

**Reviewer Response Bullet Points**

For anonymization concerns, respond with:
- "We have added explicit IRB approval statement and de-identification protocol to Methods (lines X-Y)"
- "Dataset access now requires institutional DUA per HIPAA minimum necessary standard - see updated Data Availability section"
- "We include a re-identification risk assessment in Supplementary Section S3, following NIH guidance"
- "Model predictions are on de-identified data only; no patient-level outputs are retained in the artifact"

**Critical**: If you haven't done a formal re-identification risk assessment, do that *before* submission. Reviewers will ask.
