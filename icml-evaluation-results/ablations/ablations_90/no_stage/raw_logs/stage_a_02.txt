The user is new to ML for climate and asking for a feasible beginning. This is a vague question from a beginner. I need to:
1. Give my honest assessment: they need a concrete, achievable starting point, not broad advice
2. Be specific about what won't work (trying to solve climate change as a whole)
3. Give them a clear path forward with ONE specific, tractable project

Keep it short (50-150 words) and avoid frameworks or lists. Pick ONE good starting point.

Don't start with "climate change" - that's too broad and you'll get lost. Pick one specific, measurable problem where ML actually helps.

**Start here:** Predict short-term solar power generation from weather forecasts. It's feasible, has clear metrics (MAE on MW output), and real impact for grid operators.

**Why this works:** You'll work with real data (public weather/satellite datasets), face actual challenges (temporal drift, missing data), and the problem is well-scoped. You can build a baseline in 2-3 weeks.

**What to avoid:** Anything requiring new physics simulations or global-scale modeling. You don't have the compute or domain expertise yet.

**Next step:** Download the NREL Solar Power dataset and build a simple XGBoost model using weather features as input. Get that working first, then we can talk about improvements.
