The user asks if creating AGI to solve world hunger is novel. This is a vague, grandiose idea that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of both AGI and research novelty. I need to be direct and critical.

Key points:
- This is not a research question, it's a sci-fi aspiration
- Novelty is the wrong question entirely
- The premise is flawed: AGI doesn't exist, and "solve world hunger" is vastly complex
- I need to explain why this framing is unworkable and redirect them

My honest assessment: This is not a research idea at all. It's a vague aspiration that would get laughed out of any serious venue. I need to explain why and give them a path to something actually researchable.

This isn't a research question—it's a sci-fi aspiration. Novelty is irrelevant because it's not even in the realm of testable science.

**The core problem:** AGI doesn't exist, and "solve world hunger" involves economics, logistics, politics, climate, and infrastructure—not just AI. Even if AGI existed tomorrow, the bottleneck isn't intelligence; it's coordination, resources, and political will.

**What you're actually proposing is either:**
1. Building AGI itself (a 50+ year open problem with no clear path), OR
2. Applying existing AI to hunger-related sub-problems

**If you want to do meaningful work, pick a concrete sub-problem:**
- Predict crop failures 2 weeks earlier than current models using satellite data
- Optimize food distribution networks in a specific region with known constraints
- Detect early signs of malnutrition from mobile phone images

These are researchable. Your current framing is not.
