The user is asking about running self-supervised learning on hospital shift notes. This is a specific technical question with ethical implications. I need to:

1. Assess the idea honestly - is this promising or problematic?
2. Check for prior work (need to search)
3. Evaluate ethical risks directly
4. Give clear direction

Key considerations:
- Hospital shift notes contain sensitive PHI
- Self-supervised learning on clinical text is an active area
- Ethical risks are substantial and non-negotiable
- Need to be direct about both technical feasibility and ethical barriers

Let me search for prior work first, then structure a critical but constructive response.

This is technically feasible but ethically fraught. Here's my assessment:

**Prior work exists**: Self-supervised learning on clinical notes is well-studied (e.g., ClinicalBERT, GatorTron, PubMedBERT fine-tuned on MIMIC). The technical approach isn't novel.

**Critical ethical problems**:
- **PHI exposure**: Shift notes contain names, dates, diagnoses - direct HIPAA violations if not properly de-identified
- **Consent issues**: Patients didn't agree to their data being used for model training
- **Re-identification risk**: Even "de-identified" clinical text can be re-identified, especially shift notes with temporal patterns and provider-specific details

**This won't work** for real deployment unless you have:
1. IRB approval with explicit patient consent
2. A proper data use agreement with the hospital
3. A de-identification pipeline validated by experts (not just regex)
4. A plan for handling the liability

**Better path**: Use publicly available de-identified datasets like MIMIC-III/IV from MIT. If you need shift notes specifically, partner with a hospital's research arm and go through proper channels. Don't try to "get away with it" - that's career-ending.

What specific clinical task are you trying to solve? I can help you find an appropriate public dataset.
