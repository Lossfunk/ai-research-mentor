The user is asking about the PeerRead paper's labeling process being underpowered for newer venues, and wants help articulating generalizability concerns and proposing a concrete follow-up experiment. This is a specific technical question about a known paper in the ML/NLP research space.

Key points to address:
1. What is the PeerRead paper and its labeling process?
2. Why is it underpowered for newer venues?
3. How does this affect generalizability?
4. What concrete experiment would address reviewer concerns?

I need to be critical and direct. The core issue is likely that PeerRead's human-labeled review data is heavily skewed toward established venues (like ACL/NeurIPS), making models trained on it potentially fail on newer venues with different review cultures, topic distributions, or quality standards.

My assessment should lead: this is a real problem that will get your paper rejected if not addressed. Then explain why, and give a specific experiment.

Let me structure this:
- Lead with assessment: This is a critical flaw that undermines claims about generalizability
- Explain the mechanism: Distribution shift between old and new venues
- Propose concrete experiment: Train/test split by venue age, or better, a targeted data collection

This is a critical flaw that will get your paper rejected if you don't address it head-on. The PeerRead dataset is heavily skewed toward established venues (ACL, NeurIPS, ICLR), so any model trained on it inherits the review culture, topic distribution, and quality standards of those venues. Newer venues (MLSys, EMNLP Findings, workshop tracks) have different reviewer pools, acceptance criteria, and paper characteristics—your model will likely fail silently on these.

**Generalizability problem:** You're committing a classic distribution shift error. The labeling process isn't just "underpowered"—it's systematically biased. Reviewers will hammer you on external validity: why should we believe your model works for *our* venue when you only tested it on 10-year-old ACL data?

**Concrete follow-up experiment:** Don't just do a random train/test split. Do a **venue-age split**:
1. Train exclusively on reviews from venues >5 years old (pre-2019)
2. Test on reviews from venues ≤3 years old (2021+)
3. **Key metric:** Report performance *degradation* between old-venue test set and new-venue test set. If you see >5-10% F1 drop, you have a real problem.

**To reassure reviewers:** Run a **targeted data collection** for 2-3 newer venues (100 papers each). Have your model predict accept/reject and compare to actual outcomes. This is expensive but shows you understand the limitation. If you can't do this, at least show that your error analysis reveals systematic failures on newer venues (e.g., worse performance on interdisciplinary topics that are overrepresented in new venues).

Bottom line: Acknowledge the bias explicitly in your limitations and show you've measured it, not just hand-waved about it.
