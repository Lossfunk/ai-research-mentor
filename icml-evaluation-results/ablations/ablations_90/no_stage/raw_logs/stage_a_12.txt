The user is asking for practical advice on keeping up with AI research when English isn't their first language. This is a legitimate concern that many researchers face. I need to be direct and helpful, not overly critical. The core issue is language barrier + volume of research.

Key points to address:
- This is a real problem, not a weakness
- Practical strategies that work
- Don't overwhelm with too many options
- Focus on what actually helps

I should avoid:
- Being dismissive
- Giving generic advice
- Listing 10 different tools
- Softening the reality that this is hard

My assessment: This is a solvable problem with the right approach, but requires being strategic rather than trying to read everything.

This is a real challenge, but it's absolutely manageable with the right strategy. Don't try to read everything—nobody does.

**Focus on depth over breadth.** Pick 2-3 key papers per week in your subfield and read them thoroughly. Use tools like Google Translate for the abstract first, then read the English version to build vocabulary. Keep a personal glossary of recurring terms.

**Engage with non-text content.** Watch conference talks on YouTube (many have subtitles), listen to podcasts, and join Discord/Slack communities where you can ask clarifying questions. Visual explanations often transcend language barriers.

**Write to learn.** Summarize papers in your own words, even if just for yourself. This forces comprehension and builds your technical English faster than passive reading.

**Use AI tools strategically.** ChatGPT or Claude can explain dense paragraphs, but verify against the original—sometimes they hallucinate. Don't become dependent.

**Find your people.** Connect with other non-native speakers in your field. You'll learn faster together and realize everyone struggles with the same papers.

The goal isn't perfect English—it's understanding the ideas. Start there.
