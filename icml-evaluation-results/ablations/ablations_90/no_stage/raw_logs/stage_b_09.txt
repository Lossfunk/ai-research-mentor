The user is asking about novelty and pitfalls for generative models in indigenous language revitalization. This is a specific, technical question that requires critical evaluation.

Key points to consider:
- Novelty: This space is actually quite crowded now. Many projects exist, so I need to be honest about what's already been done.
- Pitfalls: There are serious ethical and technical issues that most researchers gloss over.
- I should be direct about both the challenges and whether this is even a good research direction.

My honest assessment: The basic idea of "build a generative model for indigenous languages" is no longer novel by itself. The novelty would have to come from a very specific angle. And the pitfalls are substantial and often ignored.

I need to be critical but also helpful - if they still want to pursue this, what would actually be a valuable contribution?

The basic idea of using generative models for indigenous language revitalization is **no longer novel** by itself. There are already dozens of projects (e.g., for Māori, Hawaiian, Cherokee, Sami) and papers on arXiv from the last 2-3 years. If you're just proposing "GPT for [language X]," that's not research—it's implementation.

**For novelty, you need a specific angle:**
- A novel *linguistic phenomenon* that current models fail on (e.g., polysynthetic morphology, tone systems)
- A novel *methodological contribution* (e.g., data-efficient training with <100 hours of speech)
- A novel *evaluation framework* that actually measures revitalization impact, not just perplexity

**Major pitfalls researchers ignore:**

1. **Data colonialism**: Scraping data from indigenous communities without meaningful governance is extractive. Many communities have explicit data sovereignty protocols. Have you secured community IRB approval? Who owns the model?

2. **Performance theater**: A model with "SOTA perplexity" is useless if it generates fluent but wrong language that teaches learners errors. Low-resource evaluation is broken—your 50 BLEU points might be noise.

3. **Solutionism**: Languages aren't dying from lack of technology. They're dying from lack of speakers, which is a political/social problem. A chatbot doesn't create fluent speakers; immersion programs do. Are you distracting from actual revitalization work?

**What to do instead:**
Partner with a specific community from day one. Let *them* define the problem. Maybe they need a pronunciation tool, not a text generator. The research contribution is in *how you co-design* the system, not the model architecture.

If you can't name your community partner and their specific need, stop. This isn't your research direction to choose.
