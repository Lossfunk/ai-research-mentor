The user wants a draft response to reviewers about missing LLM comparisons in a PeerRead study. This is a specific, practical request. I need to:
1. Give my honest assessment of what makes a good response
2. Be direct about what reviewers want to hear
3. Provide a concrete, principled plan - not vague promises
4. Keep it succinct as requested

Key elements: acknowledge gap, explain why it happened (briefly), outline specific plan with criteria for inclusion, show it's thoughtful not just reactive.

This is a legitimate criticism. Reviewers are right to flag this—comparing against LLMs is now table stakes for most NLP tasks, and omitting them makes your results hard to interpret.

Here's a draft response:

**Response to Reviewers:**

We thank the reviewers for this important feedback. The omission of LLM comparisons was an oversight, not a principled decision. We will address this in the revision.

**Plan for LLM inclusion:**

We will benchmark 3-4 representative LLMs spanning different scales and access levels:
- **API-based**: GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 (state-of-the-art, but black-box)
- **Open-weight**: Llama-3.1-70B and Mixtral-8x22B (reproducible, controllable)

**Evaluation protocol:**
- Zero-shot and few-shot (3 examples) prompting
- Chain-of-thought variants where applicable
- Cost/latency reporting alongside accuracy
- Error analysis comparing failure modes to our model

**Principled inclusion criteria:**
We will only include LLMs where we can ensure (1) reproducible evaluation, (2) fair comparison (same train/test splits), and (3) meaningful analysis beyond just leaderboard numbers. If API limitations prevent this, we will explicitly state so.

This will strengthen the paper's contribution by properly contextualizing our results against current best practices.

This shows you take the criticism seriously while demonstrating you won't just slap on random LLM numbers without thought.
