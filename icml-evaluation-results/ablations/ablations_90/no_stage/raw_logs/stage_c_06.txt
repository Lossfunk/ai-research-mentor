The user wants a plan for federated learning in low-resource countries. This is a specific technical question that needs critical evaluation. Let me think about the core challenges and whether their implicit assumptions are valid.

Key issues:
- Infrastructure limitations (intermittent connectivity, low bandwidth)
- Device heterogeneity (old phones, limited compute)
- Data scarcity and quality issues
- Privacy/security concerns in different regulatory contexts
- Sustainability of deployment

I need to be direct about what's realistic and what's not. The biggest mistake here would be proposing a standard FL pipeline without addressing the fundamental constraints. I should focus on the most critical bottleneck first.

My assessment: Standard FL approaches will fail because they assume reliable connectivity and decent compute. The plan must start with infrastructure-aware design, not algorithmic sophistication.

I should give a concise but actionable plan that addresses the real constraints, not a generic framework.

Standard federated learning approaches will fail in low-resource settings because they assume reliable connectivity and modern devices. Your plan needs to start with infrastructure constraints, not algorithmic sophistication.

**Lead with edge-aware architecture**: Design for 2G/3G networks and devices with <2GB RAM. Use tiny models (MobileNetV3-scale) and aggressive compression. Your first experiment should measure actual network uptime and device capabilities in target regions—most papers skip this and waste months on unrealistic simulations.

**Critical bottleneck**: Data heterogeneity is extreme when devices are scarce. With 50-200 active clients (typical in these settings), your statistical power is weak. You'll need client selection algorithms that actively manage bias, not random sampling.

**What to build first**: A robust simulation that models intermittent disconnections, variable compute, and realistic data distributions. Test your FL pipeline under 70% client dropout rates. If it doesn't handle this, it's not deployable.

**Avoid the common trap**: Don't optimize for model accuracy in simulation. Optimize for training completion rate under realistic network conditions. A model that finishes training at 85% accuracy beats one that targets 95% but never converges due to client churn.

Start there. Measure real constraints first, then design accordingly.
