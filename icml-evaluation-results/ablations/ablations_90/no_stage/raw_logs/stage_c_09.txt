The user wants a one-year roadmap for evaluating interpretability tools on autonomous driving perception models. This is a specific, complex request that requires planning. I need to:

1. Assess if this is a good research direction
2. Provide a realistic timeline with concrete milestones
3. Include ablations and governance checkpoints
4. Keep it focused and actionable

My honest assessment: This is a solid research direction. Interpretability for autonomous driving is critical for safety and regulation, but most work is scattered. A systematic evaluation framework would be valuable.

Key considerations:
- Need to define what "interpretability tools" means (attention maps, saliency, concept-based, etc.)
- Need realistic benchmarks (not just ImageNet proxies)
- Governance checkpoints are crucial for safety-critical systems
- Ablations should test what matters

I'll structure this as quarters with specific deliverables, not vague phases.

This is a strong research direction—autonomous driving desperately needs systematic interpretability evaluation, not just ad-hoc visualizations. Here's a focused one-year roadmap:

**Q1: Foundation & Benchmarking**
- Define evaluation criteria: faithfulness, completeness, latency overhead, and human-AI team performance
- Curate 3-5 safety-critical scenarios (e.g., occlusion handling, sensor fusion failures) from nuScenes or Waymo Open Dataset
- Establish baselines: run 5 standard methods (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, attention rollout, TCAV) on a ResNet-50 detector
- **Governance checkpoint**: Present evaluation framework to stakeholders; get buy-in on metrics

**Q2: Method Development & Ablations**
- Implement your interpretability method (or select 2-3 promising ones to compare)
- Run ablations: test sensitivity to architecture changes (CNN vs Transformer), input resolution, and number of queries
- Measure computational overhead at inference time—if it adds >20ms latency, it's a non-starter
- **Ablations focus**: Which components actually improve faithfulness vs. just produce prettier visualizations?

**Q3: Human Evaluation & Safety Cases**
- Design human study: can engineers predict model failures 30% better with your tool?
- Create 10 safety case studies showing how interpretability catches edge cases (adversarial weather, sensor malfunctions)
- **Governance checkpoint**: External review with autonomous vehicle safety engineers; pass/fail on actionable insights

**Q4: Validation & Dissemination**
- Validate on held-out deployment scenarios from industry partner or public dataset
- Write paper focusing on *evaluation methodology* as main contribution—this is more valuable than yet another method
- Open-source evaluation suite so others can add methods

**Critical warning**: If by Q2 your method doesn't show measurable improvement in human-AI team performance (not just qualitative heatmaps), pivot. Pretty visualizations are useless if they don't help engineers prevent accidents.
