The user is asking about what ablations and error analyses reviewers will expect for the PeerRead paper's acceptance classification task, specifically regarding hand-engineered features. This is a specific technical question about a known paper (PeerRead), so I should give direct, critical feedback about what reviewers would want to see.

Key points to cover:
- The PeerRead dataset and task (predicting paper acceptance)
- Hand-engineered features vs learned representations
- What reviewers typically expect for this type of work

I need to be direct and critical about what would make the analysis compelling vs weak.

Reviewers will expect targeted ablations that actually test your claims about hand-engineered features. Here's what they'll look for:

**Critical ablations:**
- **Feature group ablation**: Remove each hand-engineered feature group (readability, novelty, structure) individually. If you claim "novelty features matter most," show the performance drop when only those are removed. Vague "we tried removing some features" won't cut it.
- **Interaction with text representations**: Test hand-features + BERT vs. BERT alone vs. hand-features alone. If the combination barely beats BERT, your features are redundant. Many papers fail here.
- **Temporal ablation**: Test on different years. PeerRead spans 2013-2017. If your hand-features rely on 2017-specific writing trends, performance will collapse on earlier years. This is a common failure reviewers catch.

**Error analysis reviewers expect:**
- **False positive/negative inspection**: Don't just report accuracy. Show 10-15 concrete examples where hand-features helped vs. where they hurt. If you can't find clear patterns, your features aren't doing what you think.
- **Feature importance by venue**: ACL vs. NIPS have different acceptance criteria. If your "novelty" features work for ACL but fail for NIPS, that's a meaningful finding—not a weakness to hide.
- **Control for author seniority**: Senior authors' papers get accepted more often. If your features correlate with author experience (e.g., complex language → senior researchers), you're just learning a proxy, not paper quality. Reviewers will hammer this.

**What won't impress:**
- Simple ablation tables without interpretation
- Error analysis that just says "errors happen due to subjectivity"
- Not addressing confounding variables

Show that your features capture something orthogonal to what BERT learns, and that they generalize across time and venues. Otherwise, reviewers will rightfully see this as feature engineering for a solved task.
