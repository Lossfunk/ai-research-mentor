The user is asking about the PeerRead dataset and concerns about the validity of 'probably-rejected' labels for arXiv papers. This is a specific question about a known dataset in NLP/ML research. I need to:

1. Identify the core validity concerns with these labels
2. Propose concrete mitigations for a discussion section

Key facts I know:
- PeerRead dataset includes arXiv papers with "probably-rejected" labels inferred from lack of publication at target venues
- This is a proxy label, not ground truth
- Main concern: arXiv papers might be rejected for many reasons unrelated to quality (timing, fit, author preference, etc.)
- Another concern: some papers might still be under review or published elsewhere

I should be direct about the weaknesses and give specific mitigations, not vague advice.

The 'probably-rejected' labels in PeerRead are weak proxies that conflate quality with strategic submission behavior. The core problem: you don't know *why* a paper stayed on arXiv. It could be rejected from a top venue, or never submitted, or under review, or the authors prefer preprints.

**Key reviewer concerns:**
1. **Strategic ambiguity**: Many authors post to arXiv first and never submit, especially in fast-moving fields. Your "rejection" label is actually "no record of acceptance."
2. **Temporal misalignment**: A 2017 arXiv paper might be rejected from ACL 2018 but accepted to EMNLP 2018—you'd mislabel it.
3. **Selection bias**: The subset of arXiv papers people *do* submit is systematically different from those they don't.

**Mitigations for your discussion:**
- **Acknowledge the proxy**: State clearly these are "unpublished" not "rejected." Report correlation with acceptance rates, not ground truth quality.
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Re-run experiments excluding papers published within 6-12 months after arXiv posting to reduce temporal noise.
- **Subset validation**: Manually annotate 200-500 papers for actual submission outcomes via author surveys or checking OpenReview. Report agreement metrics.
- **Limit claims**: Frame findings as "predicting publication success" not "reviewer score prediction." This matches what you're actually measuring.

Without these, reviewers will (rightly) question if your model learns submission strategies rather than paper quality.
