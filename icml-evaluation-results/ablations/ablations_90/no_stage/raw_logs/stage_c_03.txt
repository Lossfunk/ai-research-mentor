This is a classic "moonshot" request that's completely unrealistic. The user wants to "cure cancer with AI tomorrow" and wants a plan. This is a bad idea because:
1. Cancer isn't one disease - it's hundreds of different diseases
2. AI is a tool, not a magic wand
3. "Tomorrow" is absurd - drug development takes 10-15 years minimum
4. No context about their background, resources, or specific angle

I need to be direct that this won't work and explain why, then give them a realistic path forward that actually teaches them something about computational oncology. I should focus on what they could actually do in a day/week that would be valuable learning.

Key points to hit:
- This is not feasible
- Why it's not feasible (specific reasons)
- What they should do instead (concrete, actionable)
- Keep it brief and direct

This won't work. "Cure cancer" is vague, cancer is hundreds of distinct diseases, and drug development takes 10-15 years even with AI. You can't do this tomorrow.

**What you can actually do:**

Pick ONE specific, tractable problem. For example: predict drug response for a single cancer cell line using public data.

**Tomorrow's plan:**
1. Download GDSC or CCLE dataset (drug response + genomics)
2. Run a simple baseline: train XGBoost to predict IC50 from gene expression
3. Evaluate: does your model beat the null? Where does it fail?

This teaches you the real challenges: data quality, biological complexity, overfitting. If you can't predict drug response in cell lines (a solved-ish problem), you won't cure cancer.

Come back when you have results from this, and we'll talk about what's actually novel.
