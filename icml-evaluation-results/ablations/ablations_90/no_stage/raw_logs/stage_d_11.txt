The user wants a user study design to validate hierarchical representations in a paper (which I don't have access to). They want sample size, instruments, and analysis plan. This is a specific methodology question that requires concrete details.

Key considerations:
- I need to be critical about what makes a good validation study
- I should ask clarifying questions since I don't have the paper
- The design needs to be feasible and rigorous
- I should avoid generic frameworks and give specific recommendations

Let me structure this as a direct assessment with specific recommendations, not a vague "here are some things to consider."

I can't design a proper validation study without seeing the paper's specific representations and claims. Send me the paper or tell me:

1. **What hierarchical representations** are you generating? (tree structures, section embeddings, topic hierarchies?)
2. **What's the task?** Are users navigating, summarizing, or just rating similarity?
3. **What documents** and how long? (10-page reports vs. 100-page legal briefs changes everything)

That said, here's what a *strong* validation would look like, assuming you're generating hierarchical clusters/sections:

**Sample Size**: 24-32 participants (powered for within-subjects comparison, effect size 0.5, α=0.05, power=0.8). More if between-subjects.

**Instruments**:
- **Task**: Give participants 3 long documents (30-50 pages each, different domains). Ask them to "mark where major topic shifts occur" and "label the hierarchy levels" (e.g., main topic → subtopic → detail).
- **Baseline**: Compare your system's output vs. a flat baseline (random splits) vs. human gold standard.
- **Metrics**: Cohen's kappa for agreement on boundaries; tree edit distance for hierarchy structure; qualitative interviews on perceived usefulness.

**Analysis Plan**:
- Primary: Does your method agree with humans better than baseline? (Friedman test across methods, post-hoc Wilcoxon)
- Secondary: Where does it fail? (error analysis on document types, depth levels)
- Sanity check: Do humans agree with each other? (if not, your task is ill-defined)

**Critical flaw to avoid**: Don't just ask "does this look right?"—that's too subjective. Force a structured task that reveals actual misalignments.

Send me the paper and I'll refine this into something you can actually run.
