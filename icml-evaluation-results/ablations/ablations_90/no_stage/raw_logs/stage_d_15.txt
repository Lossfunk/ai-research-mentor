The user wants to replace a hand-designed hierarchy with automatically learned structure (clustering-derived segments) and evaluate it against an attached paper's approach. They want evaluation steps and statistical tests for stability and coverage.

Key points:
- They mention "attached paper" but I don't see any attachment. This is a critical gap.
- They want to compare two approaches: hand-designed vs learned hierarchy
- Need evaluation for stability and coverage
- Need statistical tests

My honest assessment: This is too vague without seeing the paper. I need to ask for it and clarify the context. I should not invent details about a paper I haven't seen.

Plan:
1. Point out the missing paper
2. Ask clarifying questions about their setup
3. Give a minimal framework for what they'd need to evaluate
4. Keep it concise and focused

I don't see the attached paper you're referencing. To give you useful evaluation steps, I need to see it.

Send the paper and clarify:

1. **What domain/problem?** (e.g., image segmentation, text hierarchies, time series)
2. **What does "stability" mean here?** (e.g., consistency across random seeds, robustness to noise, temporal stability)
3. **What does "coverage" mean?** (e.g., % of data explained, semantic completeness, boundary recall)
4. **What's your baseline?** The "hand-designed hierarchy" - is this from domain experts, fixed rules, or what?

Once I have that, here's what a proper evaluation would look like:

**Stability:** Run your clustering N times with different seeds/perturbations. Measure pairwise similarity between learned hierarchies (e.g., adjusted mutual information, tree edit distance). Compare variance to the fixed baseline (which should have zero variance). Use **Levene's test** to check if variances differ significantly.

**Coverage:** Compute coverage metric on held-out data for both approaches. Use **paired t-test** or **Wilcoxon signed-rank** (if non-normal) to test if differences are significant.

But without your paper and context, I'm guessing. Send it over.
