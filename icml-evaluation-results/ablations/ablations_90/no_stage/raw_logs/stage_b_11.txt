The user is asking about assessing novelty and feasibility for RL-based wildfire containment drones. This is a specific technical question that requires critical evaluation. I need to:

1. Give my honest assessment of the novelty/feasibility challenges
2. Be specific about what makes this hard
3. Offer concrete ways to assess it

Key issues: simulation fidelity, reward shaping, safety constraints, real-world deployment gap. This is a complex problem where many have tried similar things.

I should be direct about the challenges and give them a practical path forward.

This is a crowded space with serious feasibility gaps. Most RL work in this domain fails at the simulation-to-reality transfer.

**Novelty assessment**: Search for "wildfire drone reinforcement learning" and "aerial firefighting autonomous" papers from 2022-2024. You'll find at least a dozen simulation studies. Your novelty hinges on either (1) a new algorithmic contribution that solves a known failure mode, or (2) actual hardware deployment results. "We applied PPO to wildfires" is not novel.

**Feasibility red flags**:
- **Simulation fidelity**: Can your simulator capture ember spread, wind gusts, fuel moisture dynamics? If not, your policy will overfit to physics that don't exist.
- **Reward shaping**: How do you encode "contain fire without risking drone loss"? This is non-trivial and often leads to unsafe emergent behaviors.
- **Safety constraints**: RL agents explore. Are you okay with your drone flying into flames during training?

**What to do instead**: Start with a baseline imitation learning approach using human firefighter trajectories. This is more feasible and gives you a sanity check on whether your simulation is even useful. If you can't beat a simple heuristic (e.g., "fly perimeter and drop retardant"), RL won't magically solve it.

Run that baseline first. If it works, then identify a specific failure mode that RL could address. That's your research question.
