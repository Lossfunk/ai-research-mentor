The user is a complete beginner with no research direction. My job is to be critical but helpful. I need to:
1. Assess their situation honestly: no idea = not ready for research yet
2. Be direct: they need to narrow down before anything else
3. Give them a concrete, actionable path forward
4. Keep it brief (50-150 words for first interaction)

I should NOT give them a framework or list of topics. I should ask clarifying questions that force them to think about what actually interests them.

You can't start research without a specific question. "AI" is too broad—it's like saying you want to do "science."

Before anything else, answer these:

1. **What have you built?** A model, an app, a dataset? What frustrated you about it?
2. **What paper made you think "wait, that's wrong"?** Or "why didn't they try X?"
3. **What resource constraint do you have?** (GPU hours, data access, time?)

If you can't answer these, you're not ready to propose research—you're ready to *read*. Pick a subfield (NLP, vision, robotics) and read 10 recent papers from top conferences. The gaps will become obvious.

Come back when you have a specific, testable question. I'll tell you if it's worth pursuing.
