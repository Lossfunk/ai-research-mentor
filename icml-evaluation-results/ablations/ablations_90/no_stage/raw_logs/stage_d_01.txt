The user wants to reproduce a training and evaluation pipeline from a Hierarchical Transformer paper, but they haven't actually attached any paper. I need to be direct about this problem and explain what they'd need to provide for me to actually help them. I should also give them a general framework for what to look for in hierarchical transformer papers since they seem to be working in this area.

Key points to address:
1. No paper was attached - this is a critical missing piece
2. What specific information they'd need to provide
3. General components that are typical in hierarchical transformer work
4. Common pitfalls and leakage risks in this type of work

I should be direct and critical but also helpful by giving them a clear path forward.

You haven't attached any paper, so I can't give you specific reproduction steps. To actually help you, I need:

**Required information:**
- The actual paper (PDF or arXiv link)
- Your compute budget and timeline
- Your target dataset/domain

**General components for hierarchical transformers** (you'll need to map these to your specific paper):

**Data preprocessing:**
- Text segmentation strategy (sentence, paragraph, document-level splits)
- Hierarchical tokenization scheme
- Position encoding method for each hierarchy level
- Memory constraints for long sequences

**Architecture components:**
- Number of hierarchy levels
- Cross-level attention mechanisms
- Pooling/subsampling between levels
- Parameter sharing across levels

**Training schedule:**
- Single-stage vs. multi-stage (pretrain each level separately?)
- Learning rate scaling across levels
- Curriculum: short→long sequences?
- Checkpointing strategy for huge contexts

**Leakage risks:**
- **Temporal leakage**: Using future documents in pretraining that appear in evaluation
- **Hierarchical leakage**: Higher-level pretraining features containing labels
- **Tokenization leakage**: Vocabulary built on evaluation data
- **Benchmark contamination**: Pretraining on evaluation corpora (check date cutoffs)

Send me the paper and I'll tell you exactly what won't work in your setup and what you should prioritize.
