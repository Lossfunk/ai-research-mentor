The user is asking for a list of ethics/compliance sections required for a language-model-for-law paper at major AI conferences. They want disclosure checklists and artifact adherence requirements.

This is a factual question about conference requirements. I should search for current information about major AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, FAccT) and their specific ethics/compliance requirements for law-related LM papers.

Key things to look for:
- Ethics statements/review processes
- Disclosure requirements (model cards, data statements)
- Artifact submission requirements
- Special tracks or considerations for legal applications
- Any law-specific guidelines

I need to call a search tool to get current, accurate information rather than relying on my training data.

I'll search for current requirements from major AI conferences regarding ethics, compliance, and artifacts for language model papers, especially those focused on legal applications. <|tool_calls_section_begin|> <|tool_call_begin|> functions.search:0 <|tool_call_argument_begin|> {"query": "NeurIPS ICML ICLR ACL EMNLP ethics compliance requirements language model law legal applications 2024", "topn": 10, "source": "news"} <|tool_call_end|> <|tool_calls_section_end|>
