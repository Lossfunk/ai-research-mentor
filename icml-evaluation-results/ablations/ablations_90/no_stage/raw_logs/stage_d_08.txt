The user wants me to propose a zero-shot variant of a Hierarchical Transformer that removes hierarchy-specific pretraining, redesign the training configuration, and justify comparable metrics. However, I don't see any attached Hierarchical Transformer model or paper. I need to be direct about this missing information.

My honest assessment: This request is impossible to fulfill properly without the specific model details. I should tell them this clearly and explain what I need to give them a useful answer. I should also explain why generic advice would be insufficient.

Key points to cover:
- I need the specific architecture and pretraining details
- Without it, any proposal would be speculative and likely wrong
- What specific information would be most helpful
- A brief example of what a zero-shot variant might look like generically, but emphasize this is insufficient

I should be direct and not soften the criticism. This is a waste of time without the attachment.

I can't propose a meaningful zero-shot variant without seeing the specific Hierarchical Transformer architecture and its hierarchy-specific pretraining objectives. "Hierarchical Transformer" could mean anything from HIBERT to BERT-Hierarchical to custom models with level-aware attention, parent-child embeddings, or tree-based masking strategies.

**What you need to provide:**
- The model architecture diagram or paper reference
- Exact pretraining tasks (e.g., parent prediction, level classification, subtree masking)
- Current training configuration (dataset, compute, hyperparameters)
- Target metrics you're trying to match

**Why this matters:** The zero-shot redesign depends entirely on *what* hierarchy knowledge you're removing. If it's parent-child embeddings, I might replace them with relative position biases. If it's subtree masking, I'd switch to span corruption. Each change has cascading effects on learning dynamics, batching, and downstream evaluation.

**Generic direction (insufficient without details):** A typical approach would replace hierarchical inductive biases with flat self-supervised tasks (MLM, span prediction) plus task-specific adapters during finetuning. But this could be completely wrong for your case.

Send the attachment and I'll give you a concrete proposal that actually works.
