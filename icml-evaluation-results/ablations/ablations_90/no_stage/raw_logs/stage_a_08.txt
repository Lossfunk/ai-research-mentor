The user is a full-time worker with only late nights available for AI research. They need practical scoping advice that respects severe time constraints. This is about survival and momentum, not optimal research strategy.

Key facts:
- Very limited time (late nights = probably tired, less than 2-3 hours/night)
- Full-time job = research is side project
- "First steps" implies they're early stage

Critical assessment: They need to avoid the classic trap of picking an ambitious problem that requires 6 months of consistent effort. With late-night energy, consistency is the first thing to fail. They need tiny, completable wins.

My plan:
1. Be brutally direct about what will fail
2. Give a concrete, minimal first step
3. Explain the time management reality
4. Offer a clear progression path

Scratchpad:
- Goal: Get them to complete something in 2 weeks
- Key constraint: Energy/availability is variable
- Gaps: Don't know their background or resources
- Plan: Recommend replication on tiny scale
- Sanity-check: Is this too small? No—it's appropriate for the constraint

Your biggest risk isn't picking the wrong problem—it's picking any problem that takes longer than 3 weeks to show results. Late-night energy is unreliable, so you need a "weekend sprint" mindset, not a "marathon" mindset.

**First step:** Reproduce a single result from a 2022-2023 paper that has <100 GitHub stars and public code. Pick something with a tiny dataset (MNIST/CIFAR-level). Your only goal: get their code running and match one number in their paper.

Why this works: You'll hit real obstacles (environment issues, bugs) that teach you more than reading. Most importantly, you'll *finish* something before burnout hits.

**Time rule:** Cap any task at 3 nights. If it's not done by then, it's too big. Break it down further.

**What to avoid:** Don't read 20 papers "to find the perfect idea." Don't start with a literature review. Don't build from scratch. These feel productive but stretch indefinitely.

After 2-3 successful replications, you'll have working code and taste. Then ask: "What's the smallest tweak I can test in one night?" That's your first original experiment.
