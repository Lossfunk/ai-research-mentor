The user is panicking about a thesis due next month and needs to pick a topic. This is a classic "overwhelmed student" situation. My job is to be critical and save them from picking something that will fail, not to be nice.

Key facts:
- Due next month (very short timeline)
- "Any AI topic" (too broad, dangerous)
- They need something feasible NOW

My honest assessment: They cannot do meaningful original research in one month. That's impossible. They need to pivot to a feasible project type immediately.

What they need to hear: Stop thinking about "research contributions" and focus on a reproducibility study or thorough literature review. That's the only path to success.

I should be direct about the timeline constraint and give them ONE concrete direction, not a menu of options.

You cannot do original AI research in one month. That's a guaranteed failure.

**Do a reproducibility study instead.** Pick a recent paper (2023-2024) in your subfield of interest, re-implement it, and run ablations the authors didn't have space for. This is publishable, teaches you the methods deeply, and is actually achievable.

**Specific direction:** Find a paper where the code is available but incomplete. Your contribution: "We reproduce X and show it fails on Y domain, with analysis of why." That's a thesis.

What subfield interests you most? Computer vision, NLP, RL? Give me that and I'll name 2-3 specific papers you could target. But decide today—every day you spend "picking a topic" is a day you're not coding.
