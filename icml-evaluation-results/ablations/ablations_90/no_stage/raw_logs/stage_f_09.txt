The user wants a two-week sprint plan for polishing a camera-ready paper on graph foundation models. This is a specific, actionable request. I need to be critical and practical, not just list generic tasks. Let me think about what actually matters for camera-ready papers and artifact release.

Key considerations:
- Camera-ready means final version for publication - no major changes, just polish
- Artifact packaging needs to be reproducible and well-documented
- Licensing is critical for adoption but often overlooked
- Release notes should communicate value, not just changes
- Two weeks is tight - need to prioritize ruthlessly

I should focus on what actually moves the needle for acceptance and impact, not busywork. The plan should be aggressive but realistic.

**Week 1: Paper Polish & Artifact Hardening**

**Days 1-2: Paper Finalization**
- Lock the narrative: Read the entire paper aloud to catch flow issues. Fix any remaining "weasel words" and vague claims. Ensure every figure caption is self-contained.
- Check the math: Verify all equations are numbered, defined before use, and match the codebase exactly. Inconsistent notation is a red flag for reviewers.
- References audit: Confirm every citation is actually used and properly formatted. Remove any placeholder or incomplete references.

**Days 3-5: Artifact Packaging**
- Create a one-command reproduction script: `bash run_all.sh` that downloads data, trains models, and generates all paper figures. Test it on a fresh VM.
- Dockerize everything: Build a container with pinned versions (PyTorch, DGL/PyG, etc.). Test it works without your local environment.
- Write a brutal README: Start with "What this repo does" in one sentence, then prerequisites, installation, and a 5-minute quickstart. No fluff.

**Week 2: Legal & Release**

**Days 6-8: Licensing & Documentation**
- Choose a license: MIT for maximum adoption, Apache 2.0 if you have patents. Add LICENSE file and headers to all source files.
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md: Even if you don't expect contributions, this signals maturity. Include bug report template.
- Benchmarking guide: Document expected runtimes, memory usage, and hardware requirements. Be honest about limitations.

**Days 9-10: Release Notes & Final Checks**
- Write release notes as a changelog: "What works" vs "Known issues". Be explicit about what the artifact reproduces from the paper vs what's extra.
- Final sanity check: Run the reproduction script on a different machine. Time it. If it takes >24 hours, provide pre-trained checkpoints with verification scripts.
- Submit: Upload to Zenodo for DOI, update paper with artifact link, and email chairs confirming availability.

**Critical warning**: If your artifact doesn't reproduce the main table/figure exactly, spend Week 2 fixing the code, not writing better documentation. A broken artifact is worse than no artifact.
