The user wants a discussion about improving PeerRead dataset robustness claims through crowd-sourced annotations, plus metrics for an appendix update. This is a specific technical question about a known dataset. I should:

1. Assess the core idea: crowd-sourced annotations for robustness
2. Identify what PeerRead's current limitations are
3. Suggest concrete metrics that would actually matter
4. Keep it focused and actionable

PeerRead is a dataset of scientific paper reviews. The main robustness issue is probably that it's single-annotator (the original reviewer) and may have noise/bias. Crowd-sourcing could help but has its own issues.

Key points to make:
- Current single-reviewer annotations are noisy and subjective
- Crowd-sourcing could quantify uncertainty and surface disagreements
- But need to be careful about expertise vs. scale tradeoff
- Metrics should focus on inter-annotator agreement, annotation quality, and downstream impact

I should be direct about what's actually valuable vs. what's just busywork.

Crowd-sourced annotations could strengthen PeerRead's robustness claims by quantifying reviewer disagreement and surfacing subjective dimensions that single annotations obscure. However, this only works if you recruit annotators with domain expertise—naive crowd workers will add noise, not signal.

**What would actually help:**

1. **Inter-annotator agreement metrics**: Report Krippendorff's alpha for review scores and Cohen's kappa for categorical decisions (accept/reject). If agreement is low, your "ground truth" is questionable.

2. **Annotation quality filtering**: Track annotator-reviewer correlation per paper. If crowd annotations diverge systematically from actual reviewers, either your task design is flawed or you need expert annotators.

3. **Downstream impact**: Measure how model performance variance changes with different annotation subsets. If your SOTA model's rank shuffles when trained on different annotators' labels, your leaderboard is meaningless.

**Skip the busywork**: Don't just report raw agreement numbers—explain *why* disagreements happen. Are they on borderline papers? Specific review aspects (clarity vs. novelty)? That tells you where the dataset is weakest.

**Bottom line**: Crowd-sourcing is only useful if it reveals systematic biases or uncertainty in the original reviews. Otherwise you're just adding computational cost to a dataset that's already too small to need it.
