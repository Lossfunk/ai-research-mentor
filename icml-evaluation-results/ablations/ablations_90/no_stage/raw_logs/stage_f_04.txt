The user is asking me to map venue-specific formatting and artifact expectations and adapt their plan. However, they haven't provided:
1. Their current plan
2. The venue(s) they're targeting
3. Their field or research area

This is too vague to give useful feedback. I need to ask for specifics before I can help them adapt anything. I should be direct about what's missing and what I need to see.

I can't adapt your plan without seeing it. Send me:

1. **Your current plan** - What you're actually planning to submit
2. **Target venue(s)** - Conference/journal names (e.g., "NeurIPS 2024", "ICML", "Nature")
3. **Your field** - ML, systems, bio, etc. (formatting rules vary wildly)

**Why this matters:** A plan for NeurIPS (9 pages + references, strict anonymization, mandatory code) looks completely different than one for Nature (no page limit, different anonymization rules, data deposition required). 

Give me those three things and I'll tell you exactly what needs to change.
