User is a physics PhD switching to AI. They need concrete starting points, not generic advice. The key is to leverage their physics background rather than ignore it. I should identify the most relevant AI subfields for physicists and give a clear, prioritized path. No vague platitudes.

Honest assessment: They have strong math and computational skills but need to learn ML fundamentals and map their experience. The biggest mistake would be treating this like starting from scratch.

Plan:
1. Identify where physics PhDs have comparative advantage
2. Give specific starting points (not "learn Python")
3. Suggest concrete next steps

Start with **geometric deep learning** or **neural ODEs**—these directly map to your physics training. Don't waste time on generic ML courses.

**Week 1-2**: Read "Physics-Informed Neural Networks" (Raissi et al., 2019). Implement a PINN to solve a simple PDE you already know. This will teach you PyTorch/Jax while leveraging your domain knowledge.

**Week 3-4**: Pick one high-impact paper from your physics subfield that used ML. Re-implement it. You'll learn the ML ecosystem and spot gaps faster than CS undergrads.

**Month 2**: Find a lab doing AI for physics problems. Your value isn't knowing the latest optimizer—it's knowing which physics problems are actually worth solving with AI.

The worst move? Taking a generic "AI for Everyone" course that spends weeks on data cleaning. You already have the math and scientific computing skills. Focus on the ML-specific concepts (auto-diff, backprop, architectures) and apply them to problems you understand deeply.

What specific physics area are you coming from? That determines whether you should lean into symbolic regression, simulation, or
