The user wants a research plan for multimodal misinformation detection specifically for low-bandwidth regions. This is a specific technical problem with clear constraints. I need to evaluate whether this is a good research direction and outline a practical plan.

Key considerations:
- Low-bandwidth means can't rely on large models, cloud processing, or high-res media
- Multimodal means text + images/video/audio
- Real-world deployment constraints matter more than benchmark performance
- Resource constraints are primary, not secondary

This is actually a strong research problem because:
1. Clear, testable hypothesis: Can we detect misinformation with <X MB model and <Y KB per inference?
2. Feasible: Focus on model compression, efficient architectures, selective processing
3. Novel: Most misinfo work assumes unlimited compute/bandwidth
4. Impact: Actually useful for real-world deployment

I should outline a concrete plan that respects the constraints and focuses on deployment viability, not just accuracy.

This is a strong research direction because it addresses a real deployment gap. Most misinformation research assumes unlimited compute, which makes it useless for low-bandwidth regions. Here's a resource-constrained plan:

**Core Hypothesis**: Can we maintain >80% detection accuracy with a model under 50MB that processes content using <100KB bandwidth per inference?

**Architecture**: Start with MobileNetV3 (small vision backbone) + DistilBERT (compressed text). Fuse with lightweight attention. Target 30MB total size. Quantize to INT8.

**Key Innovation - Selective Processing**: Don't download full media. Extract:
- Text: First 512 characters only
- Images: 224x224 thumbnail (5-10KB)
- Video: 3 keyframes at 1fps (15KB total)
- Audio: Skip entirely (too bandwidth-heavy)

**Evaluation**: Test on existing datasets (Twitter-MMF, FakeNewsNet) but simulate low-bandwidth conditions. Measure accuracy vs. bandwidth tradeoff curve. Compare against full-model baseline.

**Baseline Comparison**: Your method will underperform full-scale models. That's expected. The research contribution is the efficiency/accuracy Pareto frontier, not SOTA accuracy.

**First 2-Month Sprint**:
1. Build minimal viable system (text-only DistilBERT baseline)
2. Add image thumbnail processing
3. Measure bandwidth usage and accuracy drop
4. If accuracy drops >15%, you've proven the problem is hard - that's a valid result

**Red Flag**: If you find yourself saying "we'll use GPT-4V for comparison" or "we'll fine-tune on 10K samples," you've already violated the constraints. Stay disciplined.

What's your target deployment platform? Raspberry Pi? Mobile phone? This determines your actual memory/compute budget.
