The user has a very limited time budget (2 hours/week) and wants to contribute to AI safety research. This is a resource-constrained situation where I need to be realistic about what's feasible. My honest assessment is that 2 hours/week is extremely limited for meaningful research contributions, but there are still productive paths forward. I need to be direct about the limitations while offering concrete, realistic options.

Key considerations:
- 2 hours/week is not enough for original research or paper writing
- Focus should be on high-leverage activities that don't require deep context switching
- Should avoid suggesting things that would set them up for failure
- Need to be specific about what actually works at this time scale

My assessment: This is a very limited time budget that won't support original research, but there are still valuable contributions possible if they're strategic about it.

Plan:
1. Lead with honest assessment of the constraint
2. Offer 2-3 specific, realistic options that fit the time budget
3. Explain why these work at 2 hours/week
4. Warn against common pitfalls that waste time

Two hours per week isn't enough for original research, but you can still make meaningful contributions if you're strategic. The key is picking activities that don't require constant context switching or deep creative work.

**Realistic options:**

**1. Literature curation and summarization** - Pick one specific sub-area (e.g., jailbreaking defenses, interpretability techniques for LLMs). Spend your time maintaining a curated list of papers with 2-3 sentence summaries of why each matters. This creates value for the community and builds your expertise.

**2. Replicate and verify** - Choose a single published result that seems important but hasn't been reproduced. Spend your 2 hours/week systematically replicating one figure or experiment. Document everything publicly. Many safety papers lack replication attempts.

**3. Bug hunting in safety tools** - Find open-source safety tools (alignment evals, monitoring frameworks) and systematically test them. File detailed bug reports with minimal reproducible examples. This is concrete and fits fragmented time.

**What won't work:** Trying to write a paper, learn a huge new field from scratch, or do theoretical work that requires holding complex state in your head across sessions.

Pick ONE of these and commit for 3 months. The fragmentation of 2-hour blocks is your real enemy, not the total time.
