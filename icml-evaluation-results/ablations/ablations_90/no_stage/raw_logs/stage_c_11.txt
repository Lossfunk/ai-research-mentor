The user wants help crafting a cross-lab collaboration plan for evaluating large-scale climate model downscaling with uncertainty quantification. This is a specific, complex research proposal. I need to:

1. Assess if this is a good idea and what the key challenges are
2. Identify what makes this hard or potentially problematic
3. Give concrete direction on how to structure the collaboration

Key considerations:
- Cross-lab collaborations often fail due to unclear roles, mismatched incentives, or scope creep
- Climate model downscaling evaluation is massive in scope - need to be specific about what exactly they're evaluating
- Uncertainty quantification adds another layer of complexity
- Need to think about data sharing, compute resources, authorship, and timeline

This is a good idea in principle but needs ruthless scoping to avoid failure. I should be direct about the failure modes and give them a minimal viable structure.

This collaboration will fail without ruthless scoping. Climate downscaling evaluation is a minefield of scope creep.

**Your plan needs three non-negotiable elements:**

1. **Single shared research question** - Not "evaluate downscaling" but something like: "Which uncertainty quantification method best captures precipitation extremes in the Southwest US?" If you can't agree on one question, don't collaborate.

2. **Clear resource partitioning** - Who provides what? Specify: compute hours, data storage, personnel time (FTEs), and who pays for what. Vague "we'll share resources" kills collaborations when the bill arrives.

3. **Authorship and timeline locked in writing** - Map contributions to paper sections NOW. If Lab A does the downscaling and Lab B does the UQ analysis, who writes what? Who's first author? What's the deadline? Get this in a 1-page MOU before writing a single line of code.

**What to do next:** Draft a 1-page collaboration agreement with these three sections. If you can't fill it out in 30 minutes, the collaboration isn't ready. Show it to me and I'll tell you where it's still too vague.
