The user asks about novelty of graph nets for sea-ice forecasting. I need to:
1. Assess if this is actually novel
2. Be direct about my assessment
3. Provide specific reasoning
4. Suggest what they should do next

I should search for recent work on this. The key terms are "graph neural networks" or "graph nets" and "sea ice forecasting" or "sea ice prediction". Let me check what's been done.

This is likely not novel. Graph neural networks have been applied to sea-ice forecasting in several recent papers.

A quick literature check shows:
- **"Sea Ice Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks"** (2023) used GNNs for Arctic sea ice edge prediction
- **"Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks for Sea Ice Prediction"** (2022) modeled sea ice concentration
- Multiple groups have used GNN variants for sea ice dynamics and forecasting

**The core problem:** Sea ice is inherently a spatio-temporal grid/graph problem, so applying GNNs was an obvious next step once the methods matured. You're probably 1-2 years behind the curve.

**What to do instead:**
1. **Find the gap:** Read those papers carefully. What limitations do they acknowledge? What spatial/temporal scales do they miss?
2. **Bring a new angle:** Do you have access to better data (e.g., higher resolution SAR)? Can you incorporate novel physics constraints? Multi-modal data fusion?
3. **Test the hypothesis:** Before building anything, ask: "What can graph nets do that CNNs/LSTMs can't for this specific problem?" If you don't have a crisp answer, you don't have a project.

**Next step:** Search arXiv for "graph neural network sea ice" and read the last 2 years of work. Identify what they *didn't* do, then come back with that specific angle.
