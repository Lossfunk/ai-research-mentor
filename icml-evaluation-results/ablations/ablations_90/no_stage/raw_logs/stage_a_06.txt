The user is expressing a fundamental tension: they want to do AI research but hate math. This is a common sentiment, but it's important to be direct about the reality. AI research, especially at the frontier, is deeply mathematical. I need to be honest about this constraint while also exploring if there are viable paths that might work for them.

Key points to address:
- Math is non-negotiable for most core AI research
- "Hate" could mean different things: difficulty, lack of background, or genuine disinterest
- There might be specific sub-areas that are less math-heavy, but they're limited
- The real question is whether they want to do research *despite* this or if they should reconsider

I should be direct and not sugarcoat this. The most helpful thing is to give them a realistic assessment and concrete options, not false hope.

This is a fundamental problem. Modern AI research is deeply mathematical—linear algebra, probability, optimization, and calculus are non-negotiable for understanding why models work, not just how to use them.

**If you genuinely hate math, you have two realistic paths:**

1. **Reconsider "research" vs "engineering."** Most "AI research" roles at labs are actually ML engineering—running experiments, tuning hyperparameters, building datasets. This uses math as a tool, not a daily creative language. You can succeed here with solid coding and intuition.

2. **Find the least-math corners.** Focus on empirical, systems-oriented work: efficiency, scaling laws, dataset curation, interpretability via visualization, or human-AI interaction. Even these require *some* math, but you can lean on computational experiments over proofs.

**What won't work:** Pretending the math doesn't matter or hoping you'll "pick it up as you go" without addressing the hatred. That leads to burnout and mediocre work.

**Action:** Identify exactly what you dislike. Is it the abstraction? The notation? Gaps in fundamentals? Or pure disinterest? Your answer determines whether this is a skill gap to close or a fundamental mismatch.
