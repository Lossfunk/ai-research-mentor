The user wants me to check their paper for ethics/compliance risks. This is a specific request, but they haven't provided the paper. I need to be direct and critical: I can't evaluate what I can't see. I should ask for the paper and key information, but also give them a framework of what I'll be looking for so they understand the gaps. This is a practical, focused response that respects their time and mine.

I can't evaluate your paper without seeing it. Send me the draft and I'll give you a direct assessment.

To do this properly, I need:

1. **The actual paper** (PDF or text)
2. **Dataset details**: names, sources, licenses, how you accessed them
3. **Human data**: IRB approval numbers, consent procedures, anonymization methods
4. **Compute**: cluster specs, total GPU-hours, energy estimates if you have them

**What I'll be checking for:**

- **Dataset licenses**: Are you using CC-BY-NC commercially? Missing attribution? Using restricted data without permission?
- **Human data**: No IRB where required? Re-identification risks? Consent gaps?
- **Compute**: Missing disclosures that venues now require (e.g., NeurIPS checklist)? Vague "we used a cluster" statements?

Common fatal flaws I see: using ImageNet (restricted) without acknowledgment, MTurk data without IRB, no compute details for reproducibility. 

Send the paper and I'll tell you exactly what needs fixing.
