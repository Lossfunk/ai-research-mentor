The user wants a venue-specific submission plan for a robotics safety paper. This is a specific, practical request that requires concrete details about conference/journal requirements. I need to:

1. Identify the most relevant venues for robotics safety research
2. Provide specific requirements for each (videos, artifacts, ethics)
3. Be direct and critical about what matters

Key venues to cover: ICRA, IROS, RSS, RA-L, maybe Science Robotics or Nature Machine Intelligence. I should focus on the top robotics conferences where safety work is actually published.

I need to be specific about:
- Video length/format requirements
- Artifact checklists (code, data, models)
- Ethical review/approval requirements

Let me structure this clearly and concisely, focusing on the most important details for each venue.

For robotics safety papers, target ICRA, IROS, or RSS. Here's what actually matters:

**ICRA/IROS (IEEE):**
- **Video:** 2-minute maximum, MP4 format, 50MB limit. Must show robot behavior; narration required. Upload to IEEE Xplore portal by submission deadline.
- **Artifacts:** Code and data submission is now *mandatory* for reproducibility. Include a README with hardware specs, dependencies, and 1-sentence installation test. No checklist—just upload to IEEE DataPort and link in paper.
- **Ethics:** No formal ethics review unless human subjects involved. If you used human operators, include IRB approval number in footnote. If not, state "No human subjects" in a 1-sentence ethics statement.

**RSS (Robotics: Science and Systems):**
- **Video:** 5-minute maximum, hosted on your own site (YouTube/Vimeo). Must be accessible without login. Link in abstract. Quality matters more here—reviewers actually watch them.
- **Artifacts:** Strongly encouraged but not mandatory. If you submit, include a 1-page "Reproducibility Supplement" with system diagram, parameters, and random seeds. Upload to permanent repository (Zenodo preferred).
- **Ethics:** Requires explicit "Safety and Ethics" section in paper (0.5 page). Discuss failure modes, physical risks, and mitigation. No IRB needed for operator studies under 30 minutes.

**Critical:** Most robotics safety papers get rejected because the video doesn't clearly show the failure case you're addressing. Show the robot *failing* in the first 15 seconds, then your solution. Reviewers don't have time for slow builds.

**Action:** Pick ONE venue now. ICRA/IROS for volume, RSS for prestige. Don't split effort—requirements differ enough that you can't reuse materials easily.
