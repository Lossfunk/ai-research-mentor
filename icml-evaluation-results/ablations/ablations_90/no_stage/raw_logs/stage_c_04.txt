The user is asking about doing research with zero compute. This is a practical constraint question. I need to be honest about what's feasible and what's not, and give them concrete directions.

Key points to address:
- Zero compute is a severe constraint, but not impossible
- Focus on what doesn't need compute: theory, literature analysis, data analysis (if data is public), writing, conceptual work
- Be realistic about limitations
- Give specific, actionable paths forward

I should lead with my honest assessment: it's very hard but possible in specific domains. Then give concrete examples of what they can do.

Zero compute is brutal but not a death sentence for research. Your best bet is to pivot to work that doesn't require training models or heavy simulation.

**Focus on these areas:**

**1. Theory & Analysis:** Re-analyze existing papers. Find contradictions, unstated assumptions, or gaps in proofs. Many breakthroughs come from "just reading carefully."

**2. Data & Meta-Analysis:** Use public datasets (Kaggle, Hugging Face, government data). Do statistical analysis, error analysis, or audit existing models for biases. A laptop can handle most tabular data analysis.

**3. Literature Synthesis:** Write a survey that actually moves the field forward—identify a pattern others missed, propose a new taxonomy, or connect disparate fields. Don't just summarize; critique and reorganize.

**4. Conceptual Frameworks:** Develop new evaluation protocols, formalize problems mathematically, or design benchmarks that expose current weaknesses.

**What won't work:** Anything requiring model training, large-scale experiments, or heavy simulation. Don't waste time on ideas that need compute you don't have.

Pick one domain where you can contribute without experiments and go deep. What's your field? I can help you narrow it down.
