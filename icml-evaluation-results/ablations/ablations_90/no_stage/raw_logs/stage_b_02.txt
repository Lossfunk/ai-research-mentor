The user is asking about compressible LLMs and wants to know about novelty and what tests to run. This is a broad topic. I need to assess what's actually novel here and give them concrete direction.

Key considerations:
- "Compressible LLMs" is vague - could mean many things (pruning, quantization, low-rank factorization, etc.)
- This is a crowded space with tons of recent work
- Need to push them to be more specific about their angle
- Should give them a quick sanity check on novelty and concrete next steps

My honest assessment: This is likely not novel unless they have a specific angle. The field is extremely saturated. I need to be direct about this and help them figure out if they actually have something or are just reinventing wheels.

Plan:
1. Lead with critical assessment: probably not novel, field is crowded
2. Ask clarifying questions to understand their specific angle
3. Give them concrete steps to check novelty
4. Suggest minimal viable experiments if they insist on proceeding

This is almost certainly not novel unless you have a very specific angle. The "compressible LLMs" space is extremely crowded—pruning, quantization, low-rank factorization, mixture-of-experts, and dynamic compression have been explored extensively in the last 2-3 years.

**What I need to know:**
- What *specific* compression method are you proposing?
- What’s your claimed improvement over existing work? (speed, size, accuracy, training cost?)
- Have you done a literature search for the last 18 months of NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR?

**Novelty check (do this first):**
Search for "[your method] + LLM compression" and "[your method] + transformer" on arXiv from 2023-2024. If you find 3+ papers doing something similar, you don’t have novelty—you have an incremental engineering challenge.

**If you still want to test it:**
Run a single experiment: compress a 7B model using your method, measure:
1. Perplexity on WikiText-103 (baseline vs compressed)
2. Zero-shot accuracy on 3 tasks (MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC)
3. Inference latency on A100 (batch size 1 and 32)

If you can’t beat LLM.int8() or SmoothQuant baselines on all three metrics, stop. Don’t waste time scaling up.

What’s your actual method? I can give you a more specific assessment.
