The user wants venue recommendations for a 6-month compressible LLMs project, plus a simulated reviewer summary. I need to be critical and direct about venue selection, not just list options. I should consider:
- 6-month timeline means limited results, so venues must match that scope
- "Compressible LLMs" is broad - need to assess if this is even ready for publication
- Ethics/formatting constraints matter for venue choice
- Reviewer summary should be realistic about what a 6-month project can deliver

Let me think about appropriate venues and what a real reviewer would say about a short project in this space.

For a 6-month compressible LLMs project, you're looking at workshops or short paper tracks, not full conference papers. Your timeline is too short for substantial novelty.

**Top realistic venues:**
- **NeurIPS/ICML Workshops** (e.g., EfficientML, MLSys): Accepts preliminary results, 2-4 page submissions. Perfect for 6-month work.
- **MLSys Short Papers**: 4 pages + references. Focus on practical compression implementations.
- **ICLR Tiny Papers**: 2 pages. Designed for small, focused contributions.

**Avoid**: Full NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR papers. Reviewers will torch you for insufficient evaluation and novelty.

**Simulated reviewer summary:**
"This submission explores compression techniques for LLMs, but lacks depth. The evaluation is limited to perplexity on two small datasets without downstream task performance or latency measurements. The method appears to be a minor extension of existing quantization work without clear theoretical contribution. The 6-month timeframe shows—experiments are insufficient and ablations are missing. **Recommendation**: Reject. Consider resubmitting to a workshop after adding: (1) downstream task evaluation, (2) comparison with SOTA compression methods, (3) ablation studies, and (4) actual speed/memory measurements on realistic hardware."

**Bottom line**: Scale your ambition to your timeline. A workshop paper that thoroughly evaluates one compression technique beats a half-baked full paper.
