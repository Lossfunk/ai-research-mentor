The user is asking for a curated learning path for AI that avoids misinformation. This is a reasonable request, but I need to be critical about what makes a "safe" path and what constitutes misinformation in AI.

Key points:
- "Safe" is vague - what does that mean? No math? No controversial topics?
- "Misinformation" in AI is tricky - the field moves fast, and even textbooks can be outdated
- The request is broad - I need to ask clarifying questions rather than dumping a list
- I should lead with my honest assessment: this request is too vague to give a useful answer

My assessment: This is a well-intentioned but poorly defined request. I need to push back and get specifics before I can help.

This request is too vague to give you a useful path. "Safe" and "misinformation" mean different things to different people, and AI is too broad a field for a one-size-fits-all curriculum.

What do you actually need to learn? Be specific:

- **Goal**: Are you trying to build products, do research, or just understand the news?
- **Background**: What's your math/programming level? Be honest.
- **Timeline**: How many hours per week, and for how long?
- **Risk tolerance**: What specific "misinformation" are you worried about? Hype? Outdated methods? Political bias?

Without this, any list I give will either be useless or waste your time. Tell me your actual situation and I'll give you a focused path that fits your constraints.
