The user is asking how to choose between AI ethics and robotics safety as a beginner. This is a strategic decision question. I need to give them a direct assessment of which is more beginner-friendly and why, not just list pros and cons.

Key considerations:
- What does "beginner-friendly" mean? (feasibility, resources, entry barriers, time to contribution)
- AI ethics: more accessible theoretically, but can be vague and hard to make concrete
- Robotics safety: requires hardware/software integration, more technical barriers
- Their background? (they didn't specify, so I should assume minimal)
- What would actually be productive for a beginner?

My honest assessment: AI ethics is more beginner-friendly in terms of entry, but it's also a minefield of vague questions that lead nowhere. Robotics safety has higher technical barriers but clearer problems. I need to be direct about which is actually better for learning and making progress.

I should also ask about their background to tailor the advice, but lead with my assessment.

Robotics safety is more beginner-friendly if you want to actually *do* research that works.

AI ethics sounds accessible—read some papers, write some philosophy—but that's the trap. Most beginner ethics projects end up as vague opinion pieces that wouldn't survive peer review. The field is saturated with unfalsifiable claims and you need serious philosophy or social science training to contribute meaningfully.

Robotics safety has clearer entry points:
- **Simulation**: You can start with MuJoCo or Isaac Gym today, no hardware needed
- **Concrete problems**: "How do I make this robot avoid obstacles it hasn't seen before?" is answerable
- **Benchmarks**: You can measure if your safety mechanism actually reduces collisions
- **Transferable skills**: Control theory, RL, computer vision—all valuable even if you switch fields

**What you should do**: Pick a specific robotics safety sub-problem like "safe exploration in model-based RL" or "adversarial robustness for robot perception." Start with a known benchmark and try to improve one metric. That's a real project.

What's your technical background? (Programming experience, math level, access to compute/hardware) That determines which specific problem to tackle.
