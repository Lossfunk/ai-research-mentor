The user wants a six-month plan for low-power computer vision tools for coral reef monitoring with volunteer divers. This is a specific proposal, so I need to evaluate it critically.

Key issues I see:
1. "Low-power computer vision" - this is vague. What does low-power mean? Edge devices? Battery constraints? Underwater power is hard.
2. Volunteer divers - implies non-experts, variable quality data, safety concerns, equipment cost sensitivity
3. Coral reef health - what metrics? Bleaching? Biodiversity? Coverage?

This plan needs to be feasible and specific. The biggest risks are: (1) underwater computer vision is hard due to lighting/color distortion, (2) volunteer data quality will be inconsistent, (3) hardware will be expensive or unreliable, (4) six months is too short for full deployment.

I should lead with my assessment that this is ambitious but possible if scoped correctly. Then give a focused plan that addresses the main risks.

This is ambitious but doable if you ruthlessly scope it down. Six months is tight for hardware + volunteers + CV, so you need to cut features, not add them.

**Month 1-2: Strip it to the bone**
Pick ONE metric that matters most (e.g., coral cover percentage). Build a simple Android app that guides divers to take standardized photos at fixed transect points—no real-time CV yet, just data collection. Test with 2-3 local divers you trust. The goal is consistent photo quality, not algorithms.

**Month 3-4: Solve the hard problem first**
Underwater image correction is your bottleneck, not the model. Spend these weeks building a lightweight color restoration pipeline (e.g., using depth-aware white balancing) that runs on a phone. Test it on 500+ volunteer-taken images. If this fails, the whole project fails—find out now.

**Month 5: Fake the "low-power CV"**
Don't deploy on-device models yet. Have divers upload photos post-dive. Run a simple segmentation model (like MobileNetV3-Small) on a cheap cloud instance. Manual review of 10% of outputs will tell you if volunteer data is usable. If accuracy <70%, you have a data quality problem, not a model problem.

**Month 6: Decide kill or pivot**
If volunteer data is garbage (it often is), pivot to using the tool for trained scientists only. If it's workable, lock the pipeline and write the paper. Don't add features.

**Critical warning**: "Volunteer divers" + "computer vision" usually equals noisy, unusable data. Your real plan should include a Month 0: can you get 5 divers to take 100 test photos each? If not, this project is dead before it starts.
