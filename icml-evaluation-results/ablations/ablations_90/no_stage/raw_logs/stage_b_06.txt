The user is asking about mixing biology datasets with transformers but hasn't provided any specifics. This is a vague question that needs clarification before I can give a useful assessment. I need to ask what they mean by "mixing" and what their actual goal is. I should be direct and critical about the lack of specificity while guiding them toward a more concrete formulation.

This is too vague to evaluate. "Mixing biology datasets with transformers" could mean anything from multi-modal fusion to naive concatenation.

**What exactly are you trying to do?** Be specific:

- **Which datasets?** (DNA sequences, microscopy images, clinical notes?)
- **What task?** (prediction, generation, representation learning?)
- **Why mix them?** What biological question does mixing answer that using them separately doesn't?

Right now, this sounds like a solution looking for a problem. That's a red flag. Good research starts with a clear biological question, then picks the method.

Give me the concrete version and I'll tell you if it's viable or a waste of time.
