The user is asking about novelty in low-cost vision transformers for wildlife counting. I need to assess whether this area is saturated or if there's still room for novel contributions.

Key considerations:
1. Vision transformers (ViTs) are relatively new compared to CNNs in this space
2. "Low-cost" suggests edge deployment, which is a practical constraint
3. Wildlife counting is a specific application domain
4. Need to consider what's actually been done vs. what people claim

My honest assessment: This area is NOT saturated, but the bar for novelty is higher than the user might think. The key is that "low-cost" and "wildlife" together create specific constraints that general ViT research doesn't address.

I should explain why it's not saturated (edge deployment challenges, domain-specific issues) but also what would make it incremental (just applying off-the-shelf MobileViT without new contributions).

This area isn't saturated, but most "novel" claims are weak. The real opportunity is in domain-specific adaptations, not just running MobileViT on camera trap data.

**Why it's not saturated:**
- Most ViT research targets server-grade GPUs; edge deployment for months-long battery operation is barely explored
- Wildlife data has unique challenges: extreme class imbalance (99% background), low-contrast subjects, temporal patterns across seasons
- Real-world deployment needs change detection (is that a new animal or the same one from 5 minutes ago?), which standard classification ViTs don't address

**What's *not* novel: **
- "We applied DeiT-Tiny to a new dataset" - this is incremental unless you show why standard approaches fail
- Minor architecture tweaks without ablation studies showing the wildlife-specific problem it solves

** What would be strong: **
- A ViT that runs on <$50 hardware with <5W power and handles the long-tailed distribution inherent in wildlife data
- A method that leverages temporal consistency across frames to reduce false positives, specifically designed for transformer architectures
- Demonstration that your approach works on a 6-month continuous deployment where you can't collect new training data

Check recent work from Conservation AI and Wildlife Insights - they're still mostly using CNNs or giant cloud-based models. The gap for efficient, autonomous ViTs is real.
