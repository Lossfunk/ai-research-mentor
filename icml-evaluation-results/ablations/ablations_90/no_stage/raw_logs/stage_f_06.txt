The user is asking for help with double-blind compliance notes for a human-centered AI evaluation paper. This is a specific, technical request about academic publishing requirements. I need to:

1. Assess what they actually need - double-blind compliance notes are typically short statements for reviewers about how anonymity is preserved
2. Be direct about what's required vs. what's overkill
3. Give them concrete, actionable text they can adapt
4. Keep it concise and focused

Key elements for double-blind compliance:
- Anonymization of main text
- Artifact release considerations
- Appendix handling
- Common pitfalls to avoid

I should lead with a clear assessment of what makes effective compliance notes and provide a template they can use.

Your compliance notes should be minimal and factual—reviewers skim these. Lead with a clear statement: "This paper is fully anonymized for double-blind review."

**For the main text:**
- Remove author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments
- Scrub self-citations: "Prior work [Anonymous, 2023]" or cite as "[Citation omitted for anonymity]"
- Remove GitHub links, project websites, or any identifiable infrastructure mentions
- Check figure metadata and PDF properties (File → Properties in Acrobat)

**For artifact release:**
State: "Anonymized artifacts (code, data, models) will be released upon acceptance. For review, they are available at [anonymous URL or as supplementary material]." If using an anonymous repository:
- Create a GitHub account with no identifying info
- Use a generic repo name (e.g., "human-ai-eval-study")
- Disable the "Public email" setting
- Scrub commit history: `git clone --depth 1` or rebase to remove identifying commits

**For appendices:**
- Appendices must be anonymized with the same rigor as the main paper
- IRB approval numbers: replace with "[IRB approval obtained; number omitted for anonymity]"
- Participant recruitment: describe platform generically ("a crowdsourcing platform") without naming MTurk/Prolific
- Informed consent forms: include in appendix but redact institution names/logos

**Critical check:** Search your PDF for your name, institution, email domains, and common identifiers. Most desk rejects happen because of missed self-references in footnotes or figure captions.

What specific conference are you targeting? Requirements vary slightly (CHI vs. CSCW vs. FAccT).
