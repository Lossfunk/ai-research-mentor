The user wants a dissemination plan for a sustainable AI optimization project. This is a specific request about code/model/dataset release. I need to be critical about what makes a good dissemination plan vs a weak one.

Key things to evaluate:
- Is this just a generic checklist or actually useful?
- What are the common failure modes in AI project releases?
- What would a reviewer/mentor actually want to see?

Common problems I see:
- Overly complex licensing that scares away users
- READMEs that are marketing documents instead of technical docs
- Too many community channels that become ghost towns
- No clear maintenance plan

I should give direct, actionable advice that avoids these pitfalls. The user didn't provide context about their specific project, so I should make reasonable assumptions but keep it focused.

Let me structure this as:
1. My honest assessment of what matters
2. Specific recommendations for each component
3. What to avoid

Word count target: 150-300 words since it's specific but no context provided.

This plan will fail if you treat it as a checklist. Here's what actually matters:

**Licensing**: Use Apache 2.0 for code, CC BY-SA for data. Anything more restrictive (including GPL) will kill adoption in industry. Don't overthink this—lawyers won't read your custom license.

**README Structure**: Lead with a 10-line code example that actually runs. Follow with:
- "Does this work on my problem?" section with clear scope limits
- Hardware requirements (be honest about GPU memory)
- One-command install that you test weekly
- Citation block (BibTeX) right at the top

**Community Channels**: Pick ONE. GitHub Discussions beats Slack/Discord every time—it's searchable, permanent, and doesn't fragment. If you must have real-time, use Slack but acknowledge you'll be the only person answering questions after month 3.

**Maintenance**: State your end-of-support date upfront. "I'll fix bugs until [6 months from now]" sets honest expectations. Link to a "How to fork and maintain" guide.

**What Kills Releases**: 
- 500-word "philosophy" sections (cut it)
- "Coming soon" features (remove them)
- Multiple install methods (pick pip OR conda, not both)

Test your plan: Can a PhD student replicate your main result in 30 minutes using only your README? If not, rewrite it.
