The user wants a submission checklist for their paper. This is a specific, practical request that requires me to be critical and helpful. I need to:

1. Assess what they're asking for - a checklist, timeline, risks, and missing items
2. Give them my honest take on what they need
3. Be specific and actionable
4. Keep it concise but comprehensive enough to be useful

Since this is about a specific paper on "Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?", I should think about what would typically be missing or risky for such a paper, but I need to be careful not to make too many assumptions. I'll provide a focused checklist that covers the essentials without being overwhelming.

Let me structure this as:
- Critical assessment first
- Timeline with key milestones
- Specific risks to watch for
- Likely missing items they should check

I'll keep it under 300 words as it's a specific question with context.

This is a solid research question, but your framing is too broad to be actionable. A reviewer will immediately ask: "Transfer to what? Under what conditions?" You need to narrow this before submission.

**Timeline (8 weeks to conference deadline)**
- Week 1: Finalize transfer scenarios (domain shift, task shift, bag size variation)
- Week 2-3: Complete missing baseline experiments
- Week 4: Full ablation studies
- Week 5: Draft results with error analysis
- Week 6: Write full paper
- Week 7: Internal review + revisions
- Week 8: Final polish + checklist audit

**Critical Risks**
1. **Baseline inadequacy**: If you're not comparing against fine-tuned MIL models and non-MIL transfer methods, your claims won't hold. This is the #1 reason these papers get rejected.
2. **Vague metrics**: "Transfer" isn't a metric. You need specific measures: performance drop under domain shift, sample efficiency curves, feature reuse analysis.
3. **No negative results**: If all your experiments show positive transfer, reviewers will suspect cherry-picking. Show when it *fails*.

**Likely Missing Items**
- **Formal definition**: What constitutes "successful transfer" in your context? Spell it out.
- **Negative controls**: Experiments where transfer should *not* work (random initialization, unrelated tasks)
- **Computational cost analysis**: Transfer is only interesting if it's more efficient than training from scratch
- **Failure case analysis**: 2-3 concrete examples where transferred models underperform

**Action item**: Before writing another word, write a single paragraph defining your transfer scenarios and success criteria. If you can't make it specific, your experiments are too vague.
