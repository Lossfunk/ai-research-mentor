The user wants to test how adding privacy/governance constraints (specifically offline inference) affects verification-like failure rates in a Hierarchical Transformer. They need baselines, datasets, and statistical tests.

Key points:
- They have a specific model (Hierarchical Transformer)
- They want to test a specific constraint (offline inference)
- They want to measure a specific outcome (verification-like failure rates)
- They need experimental design help

This is a concrete methodology question. I should:
1. Give my honest assessment of the approach
2. Suggest specific, practical baselines
3. Recommend appropriate datasets
4. Specify statistical tests
5. Keep it focused and actionable

I need to be critical but constructive. Let me think about what makes sense here.

This is a solid experimental question, but you need to be precise about what "verification-like failure rates" means and how offline inference actually constrains your model.

**Baselines**: Compare against:
1. **Standard online HT** (your unconstrained model)
2. **Cached HT** (pre-compute all representations, store on disk) - this isolates the *offline* aspect from *privacy* aspects
3. **Quantized/distilled HT** - if offline means resource-constrained, these are practical alternatives

**Datasets**: Pick ones where verification failures actually matter:
- **FEVER** (fact verification) - clear binary verification task
- **HoVer** (multi-hop verification) - tests hierarchical reasoning
- **Your own domain-specific verification data** if you have it (most relevant)

**Statistical tests**: 
- **Primary**: McNemar's test for paired failure rates (before/after constraint)
- **Effect size**: Cohen's h for proportion differences
- **Robustness**: Bootstrap confidence intervals on failure rate differences

**Critical gap**: Define "failure" operationally. Is it accuracy drop? Specific error modes (false positives vs negatives)? Without this, your experiment is uninterpretable. Also, offline inference might not *change* failure rates at all - it might just slow you down. What specific privacy/governance mechanism are you actually implementing?
