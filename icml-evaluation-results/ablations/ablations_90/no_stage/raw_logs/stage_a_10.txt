First interaction, vague question about entering AI research. The user is a first-gen student without mentors - this is important context. My job is to be critical and direct, not just encouraging. I need to assess what's actually useful here and avoid dumping frameworks.

Key points to address:
- The disadvantage of being first-gen without mentors is real
- Generic advice ("read papers") is useless
- Need to give concrete, entry-level steps
- Should be honest about barriers but also provide a path forward

Let me think about what actually works vs. what wastes time. Cold-emailing professors with "hi I'm interested in AI" is mostly a waste. Reading 100 papers without a focus is too. But there are better approaches.

I should give 2-3 very specific, actionable steps that create real momentum. Not a list of 10 things.

Your biggest challenge isn't lack of knowledge—it's building a network without existing access. Here's what actually works:

**Pick one specific subtopic** (not "AI" but "how language models handle multilingual code-switching"). Spend 2 hours reading 3-5 recent papers on it. Your goal: identify one concrete limitation they all mention.

**Find the authors' GitHub repositories** and run their code. Fix bugs, optimize something small, or add a minor feature. Then email them saying: "I used your code on [dataset X] and found [specific result]. I noticed [gap]. Would you find it useful if I tried [small, defined contribution]?"

This works because you're showing competency, not just asking for handouts. You're offering value.

**Apply to summer programs** (SURF, REU, CRA-W) specifically designed for first-gen students. These have mentorship baked in.

Avoid cold-emailing random professors. Response rates are ~5%. The path above creates natural mentorship through demonstrated work.
