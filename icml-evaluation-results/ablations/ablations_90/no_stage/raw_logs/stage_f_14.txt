The user wants a summary of major reviewer-facing risks for a climate-research AI paper and a mitigation checklist. This is a specific request about paper submission strategy. I need to be critical and direct about common failure points in this interdisciplinary area.

Key risks I should cover:
1. Methodological rigor gaps (common in interdisciplinary work)
2. Climate science validity (AI researchers often get this wrong)
3. Evaluation and baselines (weak comparisons)
4. Reproducibility (code/data issues)
5. Claims vs. impact (overstated climate impact)
6. Related work (missing key literature from either field)

I should create a focused checklist, not a generic framework. The user wants actionable items for their final submission package.

Let me structure this concisely but critically.

**Major Reviewer-Facing Risks:**

1. **Climate science validity errors** - AI reviewers will trust your climate claims; climate reviewers will tear them apart. Wrong variables, invalid assumptions, or misinterpreted physics are fatal.

2. **Weak baselines** - Comparing against outdated ML methods while ignoring domain-specific baselines (e.g., physical models, operational forecasts). This screams you don't know the field.

3. **Overstated impact** - Claiming you'll "solve climate change" or using vague statements about "helping policymakers." Reviewers want specific, measurable impact, not marketing.

4. **Reproducibility gaps** - No code, no data, or requiring proprietary climate datasets. In climate AI, this is a desk reject.

5. **Shallow related work** - Missing key papers from either ML or climate science. Shows you did a literature search in one field only.

**Mitigation Checklist:**

- [ ] **Climate validation**: Have a domain expert co-author review all climate-related methodology and claims. Include their feedback in supplementary.
- [ ] **Baseline audit**: List your top 3 climate baselines and top 3 ML baselines. If you can't name them, you haven't done your homework.
- [ ] **Impact precision**: Replace all vague impact statements with: "If successful, this would improve [specific metric] by [X%] for [specific use case]."
- [ ] **Reproducibility package**: Upload code and a small demo dataset to a permanent repository. Document exactly how to reproduce your main figure.
- [ ] **Related work stress test**: Show your paper to both an ML researcher and a climate scientist. If either says "you're missing [obvious paper]," fix it.

**Final check**: If you can't defend why your climate science is correct to a skeptical climate reviewer, don't submit yet.
