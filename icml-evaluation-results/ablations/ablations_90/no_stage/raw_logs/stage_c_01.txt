The user wants a research plan for GNNs for sea ice. This is vague - I need to figure out what they actually mean. Are they predicting sea ice concentration? Classification? Physical process modeling? I should ask clarifying questions rather than dumping a generic framework. My honest assessment: this is too broad to be actionable right now.

This is too vague to be a useful research plan. What exactly are you trying to do with GNNs for sea ice?

Be specific:
- **Prediction task**: Are you forecasting sea ice concentration/extent, classifying ice types, or modeling physical processes?
- **Spatial scale**: Regional (e.g., Arctic basin) or local (ice floe interactions)?
- **Temporal scale**: Nowcasting, seasonal forecasting, or climate-scale projections?
- **Data**: What inputs do you have? Satellite imagery, reanalysis data, buoy measurements?

A bad plan would be "apply GNN to sea ice data." A good plan starts with a concrete question like: "Can we predict weekly Arctic sea ice concentration at 25km resolution using a GNN that encodes spatiotemporal dependencies from passive microwave data and atmospheric forcing?"

What are you actually trying to solve?
