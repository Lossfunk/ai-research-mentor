The user wants a discussion paragraph about multilingual generalization concerns. This is a specific, practical request. I need to:
1. Lead with honest assessment: multilingual generalization is a real risk and reviewers are right to be skeptical
2. Be specific about why it's risky (not just "more work needed")
3. Give a concrete, actionable plan - not vague hand-waving
4. Keep it focused and concise (150-300 words range)

Key elements to include:
- Acknowledge the validity of reviewer concern
- Explain the specific risk (what breaks across languages)
- Concrete plan: which languages, why those, what resources, timeline, evaluation metrics
- Make it sound feasible and well-thought-out

I should avoid generic statements and instead give specifics that would convince a skeptical reviewer.

Multilingual generalization is a legitimate concern, and the current results may not transfer to languages with different typological features or resource availability. The primary risk is that our English-centric model exploits specific syntactic patterns that don't generalize to morphologically rich or low-resource languages.

Here's a concrete extension plan: We'll evaluate on three language clusters representing different risk profiles: (1) high-resource, similar syntax (German) to test baseline transfer; (2) typologically different but well-resourced (Japanese) to test robustness to SOV order and agglutination; and (3) low-resource, structurally distinct (Swahili) to test practical deployment viability. For each language, we'll first machine-translate our English test set and have native speakers validate 200 samples for accuracy. Then we'll fine-tune using mBERT/XLM-R for 5 epochs with identical hyperparameters, limiting training to 10K labeled examples per language to simulate resource constraints. Success criteria: maintain ≥85% of English performance on German, ≥75% on Japanese, and ≥65% on Swahili, with error analysis focused on cases where translation fidelity breaks down. This 3-month timeline directly addresses reviewer concerns while keeping scope manageable.
