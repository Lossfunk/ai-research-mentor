The user wants a concrete plan for "compressible LLMs" research over 6 months. This is a specific technical proposal, so I need to give direct, critical feedback on whether this is a good direction and what experiments actually matter. I should not just list generic experiments but evaluate what's worth doing.

Key considerations:
- "Compressible LLMs" is broad - need to clarify what aspect: pruning, quantization, low-rank, mixture of experts, etc.
- 6 months is short for a PhD-level contribution; need to be realistic about scope
- Must identify what would actually be novel vs. incremental
- Should suggest a focused set of experiments that test core hypotheses, not a kitchen sink approach

I need to be critical: Is this a good idea? What's the actual research question? Without more context, I should push back on vagueness while still giving a useful framework.

This plan is too vague to be actionable. "Compressible LLMs" could mean pruning, quantization, low-rank factorization, or efficient architectures—each with completely different experimental needs. Before I suggest experiments, what's your actual research question? Are you trying to *find* better compression methods or *understand* why existing ones work?

Assuming you want to make a novel contribution (not just reproduce existing work), here's a focused 6-month plan that might actually lead somewhere:

**Months 1-2: Baseline + Hypothesis Formation**
- Reproduce 2-3 state-of-the-art compression methods on the same model/dataset. You'll likely find they underperform reported numbers—figure out why. This is your gap.
- Form a specific hypothesis: e.g., "Current pruning methods fail because they don't account for [specific property]. My method will address this by..."

**Months 3-4: Core Experiment**
- Implement your method *only* if your hypothesis is falsifiable and beats baselines on at least one meaningful metric (not just parameters reduced).
- Run controlled ablations: which component actually matters? Most compression papers waste time on 10 ablations when 2 would suffice.

**Months 5-6: Validation + Writing**
- Test generalization: does it work on a different model scale or domain? If not, your method is probably overfitted to your setup.
- Start writing immediately. If you can't explain the contribution clearly, the idea isn't ready.

**Critical warning**: If by month 2 you don't have a concrete, testable hypothesis that isn't already in a 2023 paper, pivot. Don't spend 4 months on incremental tweaks.
