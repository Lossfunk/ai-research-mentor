The user wants a final submission checklist for a privacy-preserving NLP paper. They specifically mention:
- Artifact requirements
- Ethics statements
- Timeline checkpoints
- Deadline in six weeks

This is a practical, specific request. I should give them a focused checklist that covers these areas without being overly verbose. I need to be direct about what's critical and what can be skipped.

Let me structure this as a practical checklist they can actually use, with clear priorities and realistic timeline checkpoints for 6 weeks out.

**Final Submission Checklist: Privacy-Preserving NLP Paper**

**Artifacts (Week 4 deadline - 2 weeks before submission):**
- Code repository with README explaining setup and reproduction steps
- Pre-trained model weights or clear training scripts
- Dataset processing scripts (sanitized versions if private data)
- License file (MIT/Apache recommended)
- Compute requirements documented (GPU hours, memory)
- **Skip if**: Your method can't be open-sourced - write a detailed technical appendix instead

**Ethics Statement (Week 3 - 3 weeks before):**
- Explicit privacy guarantees your method provides (not just "we preserve privacy")
- Threat model clearly defined (who's the adversary? what can they see?)
- Data source documentation and consent status
- Limitations section: when does your method fail or not apply?
- IRB approval number or exemption justification

**Timeline Checkpoints:**
- **Week 1**: Finalize all experiments; no new runs after this
- **Week 2**: Complete ethics/artifact drafts; get advisor review
- **Week 3**: Full paper draft to co-authors; incorporate feedback
- **Week 4**: Artifacts finalized and uploaded; ethics statement polished
- **Week 5**: Camera-ready formatting; final proofread; sleep on it
- **Week 6**: Submit 24-48 hours early to avoid portal crashes

**Red flags that will get desk-rejected:**
- No reproducibility code
- Vague privacy claims without formal guarantees
- Missing ethics statement for sensitive data
- Overstated contributions

Submit early. Technical issues at deadline are common and fatal.
