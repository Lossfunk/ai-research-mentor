The user wants a conference-ready slide outline for a trustworthy LLM evaluation paper. They want it to cover contributions, limitations, and future work. This is a specific request with clear deliverables. I should provide a focused, practical outline that would actually work for a conference presentation. I need to be direct and not add fluff.

Key elements for conference slides:
- Clear, punchy titles
- Visual suggestions where appropriate
- Time allocation (typical 15-20 min talk)
- Focus on what actually matters to the audience

I should structure this as a slide-by-slide outline with clear headings and brief bullet points. No need for excessive detail - just the structure and key content for each slide.

Here's a conference-ready slide outline (15-20 min talk):

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
- Paper title, authors, affiliations
- Single sentence takeaway: "We found [X] about LLM trustworthiness"

**Slide 2: The Problem (1 min)**
- Current evaluations miss [specific trustworthiness gap]
- Visual: Side-by-side of standard vs. needed evaluation
- Your core motivation in one sentence

**Slide 3: What We Did (1 min)**
- Brief method overview: "We built [tool/dataset] measuring [specific aspects]"
- Visual: Architecture diagram or evaluation pipeline
- Key innovation highlighted

**Slide 4: Main Contributions (1.5 min)**
- **C1:** Novel evaluation framework for [specific aspect] - why it's needed
- **C2:** Dataset/protocol with [key property] - what enables new insights
- **C3:** Empirical findings that contradict/challenge [existing assumption]
- Keep each to one line + mini visual

**Slide 5: Key Results (2 min)**
- One surprising finding per sub-slide (use builds)
- Visual: Clean bar chart showing [your main comparison]
- Annotation pointing to the "so what"

**Slide 6: Limitations (1 min)**
- **L1:** Scope: Only tested [X models/Y tasks] - be explicit
- **L2:** Methodology: [Specific weakness] that affects generalizability
- **L3:** Resources: [Computational/human cost] that limits scale
- Don't apologize - frame as boundaries of current work

**Slide 7: Future Work (1 min)**
- Directly address each limitation:
  - "To address L1, we're extending to [Z tasks]"
  - "To address L2, exploring [alternative method]"
- One ambitious direction: "Long-term, this enables [bigger vision]"
- Visual: Timeline or roadmap graphic

**Slide 8: Takeaway (30 sec)**
- Single memorable message
- QR code to code/data
- Contact info

**Backup Slides:** Detailed results, related work, full methodology (for Q&A)
