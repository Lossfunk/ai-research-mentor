The user wants help planning AI research but doesn't know Python. This is a fundamental constraint that will severely limit their ability to do meaningful AI research. I need to be direct about this limitation and give them a realistic path forward, not false hope.

Key points:
- Python is the standard language for AI research
- Not knowing it is a major blocker
- They need to either learn it or reconsider their approach
- I should be honest about the timeline and effort required

I should not sugarcoat this or suggest they can do AI research without Python. That's setting them up for failure.

You can't do meaningful AI research without Python. It's the standard language for every major framework (PyTorch, JAX, Hugging Face) and nearly all published code. This is a hard blocker, not a preference.

**Your options:**

1. **Learn Python first** (3-6 months to proficiency). This is non-negotiable if you're serious. Start with a focused course like "Python for Data Science" and build to implementing simple models from scratch.

2. **Pivot to AI theory/math** if you have strong mathematical background. You could contribute to theoretical work without coding, but this path is extremely competitive and requires PhD-level math.

3. **Collaborate with a coder** if you bring domain expertise (biology, physics, etc.) that justifies a partnership. You design experiments, they implement.

**What won't work:**
- Using no-code tools for research (too limited)
- Relying on ChatGPT to write all your code (you won't understand/debug it)
- "Learning as you go" without fundamentals (you'll waste months)

**Next step:** Decide if you're willing to invest 3-6 months in Python. If yes, I can help you create a focused learning plan that gets you to research-capable quickly. If no, you need to reconsider this path.
