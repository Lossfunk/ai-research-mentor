The user is asking about joining remote AI projects or mentorship circles from a non-hub location. This is a practical career development question. I need to give them direct, actionable advice that actually works, not generic platitudes.

Key points to cover:
- Be realistic about the challenges
- Focus on what actually gets you noticed/accepted
- Avoid generic advice like "just network" or "post on LinkedIn"
- Give specific platforms and strategies that have proven track records
- Address both projects and mentorship

My honest assessment: This is doable but harder than being in a hub. The key is demonstrating value first, then asking for access. Cold outreach rarely works without proof of capability.

Remote AI work is absolutely possible, but you need to reverse the typical order: **demonstrate value first, then ask for access**.

**For projects:**
Skip the "volunteer" boards. Instead:
1. **Pick 2-3 active open-source ML projects** (Hugging Face, PyTorch, JAX repos) and make *substantial* contributions over 4-6 weeks. Fix real bugs, not typos. This becomes your proof-of-work.
2. **Document your learning** publicly. Write one technical deep-dive per week on a paper or implementation challenge. Quality > quantity. Tweet threads or Substack work fine.
3. **Target specific labs**: Find 5 researchers whose work you genuinely understand. Reference their papers in your writing, then email them with a *specific technical question* or insight—not a request to join. If your point is sharp, they'll notice.

**For mentorship:**
Formal "mentorship circles" are mostly noise. Better:
- **Join a paid, cohort-based course** where instructors are actual practitioners (e.g., Full Stack Deep Learning, ML Collective). The network is the real value.
- **Start a reading group** with 3-4 peers at your level. Meet weekly, present papers. This forces clarity and creates accountability that mimics good mentorship.

**What doesn't work**: Cold LinkedIn messages, generic "I'm passionate about AI" emails, or applying to remote RA positions without a public portfolio.

Build the portfolio first. The opportunities will follow.
