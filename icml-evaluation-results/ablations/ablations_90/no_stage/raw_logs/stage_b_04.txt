The user is asking about feasibility of graph neural networks for sea ice research with zero coding experience. My honest assessment: this is not feasible as a first project. They need to hear that jumping from zero coding to implementing GNNs for a complex geoscience problem is a recipe for failure. I should explain why and give a concrete path forward that builds necessary skills first.

This is not feasible as a starting point. Graph neural networks for sea ice analysis is a complex project requiring both ML and domain expertise. Starting from zero coding experience, you'd likely spend 6-12 months just getting to the point where you could implement a baseline model.

**Why this won't work:**
- GNNs are intermediate-to-advanced ML; you'd need to learn Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, and graph theory first
- Sea ice data is messy, multi-modal (satellite imagery, sensor networks, climate models), and requires specialized preprocessing
- You'd need a strong baseline understanding of both the ML methods and the geoscience problem to even formulate a tractable research question

**What you should do instead:**
1. **Learn Python basics** (2-3 months): Work through a data science course focusing on pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
2. **Do a simple sea ice project**: Reproduce a published linear regression or basic time series analysis of sea ice extent
3. **Then** consider GNNs: Start with a standard benchmark graph dataset (like Cora or traffic networks) before touching sea ice data

This path gets you to a real contribution faster than banging your head against a wall for a year.
