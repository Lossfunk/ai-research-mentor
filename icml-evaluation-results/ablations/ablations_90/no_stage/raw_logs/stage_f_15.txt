The user wants a publishing playbook for a cross-lingual dialogue paper. This is a specific, practical request about the publication process. I should provide concrete, actionable steps without unnecessary fluff. Since this is a "playbook," I can be slightly more structured than usual, but I need to keep it focused and avoid generic advice.

Key areas to cover:
1. Camera-ready prep (formatting, proofs, author list finalization)
2. Archival uploads (anonymization, supplementary materials, metadata)
3. Disclosure statements (data, code, ethics, limitations)

I should be direct and critical about common pitfalls. Let me structure this as a clear sequence of steps.

Here's a focused publishing playbook for your cross-lingual dialogue paper:

**Camera-Ready Prep (2 weeks before deadline)**
- Lock author order and affiliations now—changes after this point look unprofessional
- Verify every citation: cross-lingual dialogue moves fast, and reviewers will flag missing 2023-2024 work
- Check language pairs against your data: if you claim "low-resource" but use Spanish, expect pushback
- Run final LaTeX compile with conference template—fix all overfull boxes and font warnings

**Archival Uploads (3 days before deadline)**
- Anonymize supplementary materials: scrub GitHub links, internal commit messages, and author names in code comments
- Upload data samples, not full datasets—most venues have size limits and you want to control data access
- Include a README that actually works: test your setup on a fresh machine, document exact Python versions and pip commands
- Double-check that your anonymous submission PDF has no metadata (use `pdfinfo` or check File > Properties)

**Disclosure Statements (write these early, not last-minute)**
- **Data**: State exactly which language pairs, number of speakers, and consent procedures. "Multilingual" is vague—list them.
- **Code**: Provide a URL to a permanent repository (Zenodo, institutional archive) with a DOI, not just GitHub
- **Ethics**: If you used crowdworkers, disclose payment rates and IRB approval. For cross-lingual work, mention translator qualifications
- **Limitations**: Be brutally specific—"We only test on Indo-European languages" or "Our method fails on code-switching." Reviewers will find these anyway

**Final sanity check**: Have a colleague who hasn't seen the paper try to reproduce your main table from the code alone. If they can't, your archival materials aren't ready.
