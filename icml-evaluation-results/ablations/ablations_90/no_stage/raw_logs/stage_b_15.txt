The user is worried their idea to audit AI hiring platforms is overdone. They want to check novelty and scope responsibly. This is a specific question with context, so I should aim for 150-300 words.

Key points to address:
1. Their concern about overdone research is valid - this is a crowded space
2. Need to give concrete ways to check novelty, not just say "do a literature review"
3. Need to help them scope it down to something tractable and novel
4. Be direct about whether this is a bad idea or how to make it good

My honest assessment: AI hiring audits are extremely overdone. If they're doing a generic audit, it's probably not novel. But there might be specific angles that are still valuable.

I should:
- Lead with the critical assessment that this is likely overdone
- Give specific, actionable steps to check novelty (not generic advice)
- Suggest concrete ways to scope it to something potentially novel
- Keep it brief and focused

This is a crowded space, and generic audits of "bias in AI hiring" are indeed overdone. Your concern is justified.

**Check novelty fast:**
1. **Search for "AI hiring audit" + [your specific platform/dataset/method]** on Google Scholar and ACL Anthology. Look for papers from 2022-2024.
2. **Find the most recent systematic review** on AI hiring fairness. Check what gaps they explicitly call out as future work.
3. **Check if your target platform has already been audited.** If it's HireVue, Pymetrics, or similar, assume yes unless you have a novel angle.

**Scope to something defensible:**
- **Don't**: "Audit AI hiring platforms for bias" (too vague, done to death)
- **Do**: "Audit [specific platform] for [specific bias type] using [specific methodology] on [specific demographic intersection]"

**Better angles that might still be novel:**
- Auditing newer modalities (voice, game-based assessments, generative AI interviews)
- Focusing on a specific legal jurisdiction's requirements (e.g., NYC Local Law 144 compliance)
- Measuring something other than bias—like construct validity or candidate experience impact

**Reality check:** If you can't find a clear, specific gap in 2 hours of searching, the idea probably won't work. Move on or narrow it further.
