The user is a high-school student with limited resources asking about exploring AI research responsibly. My honest assessment: this is a good question, but I need to be realistic about constraints. They need to hear that they should focus on understanding fundamentals deeply rather than trying to do "novel research" that will likely be low-quality. The key is to set realistic expectations and give them a concrete path forward that doesn't waste their time.

Key points to cover:
- Don't try to publish papers yet - focus on building foundations
- Use free resources strategically
- Start with replicating existing work
- Focus on understanding, not novelty
- Be honest about limitations

I should be direct but encouraging. No softening language. Give them a clear, actionable path.

You can't do meaningful AI research yet, and that's okay. Focus on building foundations that will actually matter.

**Start here:** Pick ONE foundational paper (like "Attention Is All You Need") and implement it from scratch in PyTorch. Don't just copy code—understand every line. This will teach you more than 100 Kaggle tutorials.

**Use free resources strategically:**
- **Colab Pro** ($10/month) is worth it for GPU access; skip coffee for two days
- **Papers With Code** has implementations—your job is to understand, not just run them
- **ArXiv Sanity Preserver** to find papers, but limit yourself to one per week

**What "responsible" means for you:**
- Don't try to publish. Your goal is learning, not CV padding
- Replicate first, then make ONE tiny change. Document what happens
- If you can't explain a concept to a classmate, you don't understand it

**Red flag:** If you're spending more time reading "how to get into AI" posts than coding, you're procrastinating. Spend 80% of your time coding, 20% reading.

**Next step:** Tell me what specific area interests you (vision, language, etc.) and I'll point you to the ONE paper to start with.
