      "content": "Based on the search results and your situation, here's how to get started with NAS efficiency research while addressing your revision challenges:\n\n## **Immediate Steps for Your Revision**\n\n### 1. **Address Conflicting Reviews Strategically**\n- **Clarity issues**: Create a clear problem statement and contribution list upfront. For NAS efficiency, explicitly state:\n  - What efficiency metric you're optimizing (search time, memory, energy, CO2)\n  - How your approach differs from existing methods\n  - Quantitative improvements over baselines\n  \n- **Novelty claims**: Based on the papers above, position your work clearly against:\n  - **One-shot NAS** (weight sharing approaches)\n  - **Differentiable NAS** (DARTS-style methods)\n  - **Multi-objective NAS** (accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs)\n  - **Evolutionary approaches** (like CARS)\n\n### 2. **Key Research Directions in NAS Efficiency**\n\nFrom the literature, focus areas include:\n\n**A. Search Space Reduction**\n- Automated subspace mining (see paper #8)\n- Disentangled search (paper #5)\n\n**B. Efficiency Metrics Beyond Speed**\n- Carbon-efficient NAS (paper #9) - emerging important direction\n- Multi-objective optimization (DVOLVER, paper #6)\n\n**C. One-Shot/Weight Sharing Improvements**\n- Address the correlation problem between supernet validation and final accuracy (paper #4)\n- Better credit assignment mechanisms (AdvantageNAS, paper #7)\n\n**D. Domain-Specific NAS**\n- Efficient Transformers (paper #2)\n- Mobile/edge devices\n\n### 3. **Recommended Reading Order**\n\n1. **Start with**: \"Efficient Novelty-Driven Neural Architecture Search\" (2019) - addresses correlation issues\n2. **Then**: \"Carbon-Efficient Neural Architecture Search\" (2023) - recent multi-objective perspective\n3. **Review**: \"CARS: Continuous Evolution for Efficient Neural Architecture Search\" - alternative to gradient-based methods\n\n### 4. **Revision Strategy**\n\n**For conflicting clarity feedback:**\n- Add a clear taxonomy figure showing where your method fits\n- Include complexity analysis table (time/space/search cost)\n- Use consistent terminology throughout\n\n**For novelty concerns:**\n- Create a detailed related work section with explicit comparisons\n- Add an ablation study showing which components contribute to efficiency gains\n- Quantify improvements: \"X% faster search with Y% accuracy maintained\"\n\n### 5. **Next Steps**\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for more recent 2024 papers on specific NAS efficiency subtopics?\n2. Find papers on how to write rebuttals for conflicting reviews?\n3. Look for benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in NAS efficiency research?\n\n**Quick tip**: ICML reviewers value clear empirical validation. Make sure you compare against recent baselines (2022-2024) and use standard benchmarks (NAS-Bench-201, DARTS search spaces, etc.).",
