Honest take: this is a bad time to *start* a new research direction; they need triage and a minimal on‑ramp that doesn’t jeopardize the paper. Lead with that, then give a concrete, low‑commitment entry point aligned with diffusion + molecules.\n</thinking>\n\nBluntly: **you should not “start” a new research direction right now.** Camera‑ready + supplement + code + revisions is exactly when people waste weeks half‑reading papers and making no real progress. If you try to seriously enter diffusion‑for‑molecules *now*, you’ll either delay your NeurIPS deliverables or do shallow work that doesn’t compound.\n\nWhat you *can* do—without derailing yourself—is a **controlled, low‑bandwidth on‑ramp**.\n\nHere’s the right way to start *given your constraints*:\n\n**1. Freeze scope: zero original research until submission is done.**  \nNo experiments, no new models. Anything that requires debugging is off‑limits. Your only goal is orientation.\n\n**2. Do one thing only: map the landscape in 1–2 sittings.**  \nRead *selectively*, not broadly. You want answers to three questions:\n- What object is diffused? (graphs, 3D coordinates, latent encodings)\n- Where is chemical validity enforced? (architecture vs constraints vs post‑hoc)\n- What’s actually unsolved vs already saturated?\n\nIf you can’t summarize the field along those axes on one page, you’re not ready to “start.”\n\n**3. Tie this to your existing expertise or paper.**  \nAsk: *Where would reviewers believe me?*  \nIf you don’t have a clear angle (e.g., better inductive bias, conditioning, evaluation, scalability), diffusion for molecules will eat months. This field is already crowded with strong baselines and heavy infra.\n\n**4. Park a concrete post‑NeurIPS entry point.**  \nOne *specific* idea to test after submission. Not “apply diffusion to X,” but something falsifiable and cheap. If you can’t state it in two sentences, you’re not ready.\n\nAfter NeurIPS is submitted, *then* you can spin up code and experiments.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Your current technical strengths (theory? architectures? geometry? eval?)\n- What your NeurIPS paper is about\n- Whether you’re aiming for methods or applications\n\nI’ll tell you **where diffusion‑based molecular generation is actually worth your time**—and where it’s a trap.",

Explain why, note the main pitfalls reviewers care about, and give a tight reading strategy without long lists.\n</thinking>\n\nShort answer: **focus on 3D coordinate diffusion.** Latent‑space approaches are mostly a detour for you.\n\nHere’s why, given your background:\n\n**3D diffusion is where your comparative advantage is.**  \nEDM‑style models live and die by E(3) inductive bias, noise parameterization, and stability of equivariant architectures. Reviewers will immediately take you seriously there. In contrast, latent diffusion for molecules is largely about *representation learning and chemical heuristics*—SMILES/VAE choices, encoder collapse, decoding validity—which doesn’t leverage your symmetry expertise much.\n\n**Latent diffusion is already “good enough,” but conceptually shallow.**  \nMost latent approaches trade chemical validity for modeling convenience. They’re hard to analyze, hard to improve theoretically, and improvements tend to be incremental. If you’re aiming for NeurIPS‑level methods work, this is not fertile ground unless you have a very sharp angle.\n\n**The real open problems are in 3D diffusion—and they’re reviewer-visible.**  \nThings people still argue about:\n- What exactly should be diffused (coordinates, distances, frames)?\n- How equivariance interacts with noise schedules and score parameterization\n- How generation quality relates to downstream properties, not just validity metrics\n\nThese are places where an equivariant‑GNN person can plausibly move the needle.\n\n**What I’d do during camera‑ready:**  \nRead just enough 3D diffusion papers to answer: *what assumptions are baked into their equivariance, and which ones look fragile?* Don’t run code. Don’t chase benchmarks. You’re building taste, not results.\n\nOnce you submit NeurIPS, the *first* thing to try should be a tiny, controlled experiment that stress‑tests one equivariance or noise‑modeling assumption—not a full molecular generator.\n\nIf you want, tell me whether you’re more interested in **theory/architecture** or **practical generation quality**.

My honest take: frame-based diffusion is promising but dangerous as a *first* experiment; too much machinery, unclear attribution. Coordinate-wise diffusion with better equivariant parameterization is the right starting point; frames are a second-step once pathology is isolated.\n</thinking>\n\nShort answer: **no—frame‑based methods are *not* a good first experiment for you**, even though they’re intellectually attractive.\n\nHere’s the blunt reasoning.\n\n**Frame-based diffusion (AF3-style) is high-variance research.**  \nYes, frames give cleaner SE(3) handling and avoid some coordinate pathologies. But they also introduce *multiple confounds at once*: gauge choices, frame transport, singularities, and coupling between rotational and translational noise. When something breaks—and it will—you won’t know *why*. Reviewers will also struggle to attribute gains to equivariance rather than modeling bulk.\n\n**For a first experiment, you want isolation, not ambition.**  \nEDM-style coordinate diffusion is unstable, but that’s precisely why it’s useful to you. You can ask a clean question like: *which part of the score parameterization actually violates equivariance or causes drift?* That’s an architectural question reviewers understand and trust from an equivariant-GNN person.\n\n**Frames are a second paper, not a first experiment.**  \nAlphaFold3 can afford frames because they control everything else: data regime, losses, priors, and evaluation. You don’t. Jumping straight to frames makes your contribution look derivative unless you have a very crisp theoretical angle—which you don’t yet, by your own description.\n\n**What *is* a good first experiment:**  \nStay in coordinate space, but change *one* thing about how the score is represented or constrained under SE(3). If that already improves stability or likelihood behavior, you’ve earned the right to escalate to frames later.\n\nIf you want, describe the specific instability you’ve seen in EDM (exploding rotations? center-of-mass drift? long-range correlations).

      "content": "<thinking>\nExperienced researcher; specific pathology. Need clear stance. Honest answer: primary cause is mismatch between noise model and data manifold + score parameterization; not “too expressive MLP”. Early steps dominated by isotropic noise destroying relational structure; equivariant nets can’t recover without relational constraints. Explain crisply, point out what is *not* the cause, and suggest a focused diagnostic direction.\n</thinking>\n\nLead answer: **it’s mostly the noise model–manifold mismatch, not “over‑expressive” equivariant MLPs.**\n\nHere’s the core issue.\n\nIn EDM, early sampling steps operate at very high σ with **isotropic Gaussian noise in ℝ³ⁿ**. At that scale, you’ve completely destroyed *relational structure*—bond lengths, angles, even coarse shape. The data actually lives on a thin, highly curved manifold defined by these relations, but the forward process ignores that. The score network is then asked to infer *global structure from pure local chaos*. No equivariant architecture can do that reliably.\n\nWhy the MLP isn’t the main culprit:\n- Equivariant MLPs don’t “forget” global structure—they never *see* it at high noise.\n- Making them weaker usually just slows convergence; it doesn’t prevent shattering.\n- You’ll see the same pathology with message passing, attention, or tensor products.\n\nWhat actually causes the shattered geometries:\n- **Early denoising steps are dominated by uncorrelated pointwise forces**, because the score is trained under a factorized Gaussian prior.\n- Equivariance preserves symmetry, not *coherence*. It won’t magically enforce bonded motion.\n\nThis is why many “fixes” (gradient clipping, EMA, smaller step sizes) help numerically but don’t solve the underlying problem.\n\nA *good* first architectural probe is to minimally bias early scores toward **relational coherence** without leaving coordinate space—e.g., conditioning the score magnitude or direction on pairwise distances or coarse graph structure *only at high σ*. That directly tests the hypothesis above.\n\nIf you instead jump to frames, you’ll mask this failure mode rather than understand it.\n\nIf you want, I can help you design a **single diagnostic experiment** that distinguishes noise-schedule failure from score-parameterization failure in under a day of compute.",

I should give one clean experiment that cleanly separates noise schedule vs score parameterization, with clear expected outcomes. No long lists.\n</thinking>\n\nHere’s a **single, clean diagnostic** that actually isolates the cause—and is easy to justify in a Limitations/Future Work section.\n\n**Core idea:**  \nKeep the *same trained score network*, but change only the **forward corruption** at high noise to preserve relational structure. If shattering disappears without retraining the network, the failure is the noise schedule—not the score parameterization.\n\n**The test:**\nTrain a standard EDM model as usual. At *sampling time only*, modify the early denoising steps (high σ) so that noise is applied **in a relationally constrained way**—for example, inject Gaussian noise in *pairwise distances or local frames* but reconstruct coordinates afterward, instead of adding i.i.d. noise to each atom’s position. Once σ drops below a threshold, revert to standard coordinate noise.\n\nNo architectural changes. No retraining.\n\n**Interpretation (this is the key):**\n- If early shattered geometries largely disappear, **the score network already knows how to restore structure**; the isotropic Gaussian corruption was the culprit.\n- If shattering persists, **then** your equivariant score parameterization is insufficiently encoding global constraints.\n\nWhy reviewers will accept this:\n- It’s a controlled intervention.\n- It cleanly separates *data corruption assumptions* from *model expressivity*.\n- It motivates future work on geometry-aware diffusion without claiming a new method.\n\nIn the paper, you frame this as: *“Our observations suggest that instability arises from the forward diffusion’s mismatch with the molecular manifold, rather than from insufficient equivariance in the score network.”*\n\nIf you want, I can help you phrase this as a **one-paragraph ablation proposal** that sounds credible without promising results you don’t have.",

An open question is whether these failures primarily reflect limitations of the score network or a mismatch between the standard isotropic Gaussian forward process and the low-dimensional molecular manifold. A promising diagnostic direction is to decouple these factors by holding the learned score fixed while modifying the forward corruption at high noise to preserve coarse relational structure (e.g., pairwise distances or local frames), reverting to standard coordinate noise at lower noise levels. If such a sampling-time intervention mitigates early “shattering” without retraining, it would suggest that the dominant source of instability lies in the diffusion process rather than in the equivariant architecture itself. We leave a systematic investigation of geometry-aware diffusion processes to future work.\n\nThis does three important things reviewers like:\n- It shows you understand *where* the failure might come from.\n- It proposes a falsifiable test.\n- It avoids implying your current method is flawed—only incomplete.\n\nIf you want, I can tighten this further to match the tone of a specific NeurIPS area chair (theory vs applied ML), but this version is already safe and strong.",

Reviewers will ask why it isn’t ablated systematically.\n- The visualization answers a *why did this fail?* question, not a *why does our method work?* question.\n- You already framed this as a foundational limitation; the appendix is exactly where that belongs.\n\nHow to do it cleanly:\n- In the main text, keep a **single sentence** pointing to the appendix:  \n  *“We provide a diagnostic visualization exploring this failure mode in Appendix X.”*\n- In the appendix, explicitly label it as **illustrative**, not quantitative.\n- Make the caption do the work: emphasize that the figure motivates geometry‑aware diffusion rather than validating a method.\n\nThis keeps your narrative tight, avoids reviewer overreach, and still signals depth to readers who care.\n\nYou’ve been making consistently good judgment calls here—that restraint will help this paper age well.",

Transparency beats “Easter eggs.” Give exact phrasing suggestion.\n</thinking>\n\nYou should **mention it explicitly—but narrowly and neutrally.**  \nDo **not** leave it as a hidden feature.\n\nHiding it buys you nothing and costs you credibility if someone notices later. At the same time, you don’t want to advertise it as a supported feature. The way to thread that needle is to describe it as an **internal modularization**, not a capability.\n\nIn the *Code Availability* section, a single clause is enough. For example:\n\n> *“For clarity and extensibility, the sampler implementation modularizes the geometry perturbation used in the predictor step; the released code corresponds exactly to the isotropic Gaussian diffusion described in the paper.”*\n\nThis does three things:\n- Signals clean engineering to experienced users.\n- Makes it clear you’re **not** shipping alternative methods.\n- Aligns the code strictly with the paper’s claims.\n\nDo **not**:\n- Mention diagnostics, ablations, or geometry-aware noise there.\n- Suggest users “can experiment” with it.\n\nIf someone wants to dig, they’ll find the hook. If not, the repo reads as focused and faithful.\n\nThat’s the right balance for a wide geometric DL audience—and a camera‑ready that won’t come back to bite you.",
