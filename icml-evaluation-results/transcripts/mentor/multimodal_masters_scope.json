I should be honest: “accessibility + multimodal” is too broad; push them to a concrete population + task + failure mode. No tools needed. Ask a couple clarifying questions but also give a strong starting direction. 150–300 words.\n</thinking>\n\nYour starting framing is **too broad to turn into a paper**. “Multimodal learning for accessibility” will waste months unless you aggressively narrow it.\n\nHere’s how you should start, and I’ll be blunt about what works.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWith VLM experience + HCI, your advantage is **studying concrete failure modes of current models for a specific disabled population**, not inventing a new architecture. Reviewers in accessibility care about *who* benefits and *how it fails today*. Reviewers in ML care about *what insight transfers beyond one app*. You need both.\n\n**The right narrowing move (do this first):**  \nPick **one population + one task where VLMs are already being used poorly**.\nExamples (don’t do all of these—pick one):\n- Blind or low-vision users doing *image-based sensemaking* (charts, UI screenshots, photos with text)\n- Deaf/hard-of-hearing users relying on *audio–visual grounding* (videos, meetings)\n- Motor-impaired users using *vision-based UI agents*\n\nIf you can’t say “this population, doing this task, fails because of this model behavior,” you’re not ready.\n\n**What a testable contribution looks like (good):**  \n“Current VLMs systematically omit spatial relations in chart descriptions, which causes blind users to make wrong comparisons. We characterize this failure and show a targeted prompting or representation fix reduces errors.”\n\n**What does NOT work:**  \n- Generic “improving accessibility with multimodal AI”\n- Building a tool without isolating *why* it helps\n- Pure user study with no model insight, or pure model work with no real users\n\n**Concrete next step (2-week scope):**  \nAudit an existing VLM (e.g., GPT-4V–style behavior) on **one accessibility-critical task** with 20–50 curated examples. Label failure types. If you can’t find a *patterned failure*, abandon the task.\n\nBefore I push you further, tell me:\n1. Which disability group do you care about most?\n2. Are you aiming HCI venues (CHI/ASSETS) or ML+HCI (CHI + EMNLP-style)?\n3. Do you have access to participants, or only offline evaluation?\n\nYour answers determine the entire research shape.",

This **is viable without participants**, but only if you’re disciplined about what counts as ground truth. Many people get this wrong.\n\n**Blunt assessment:**  \nYou do *not* need BLV users yet to define patterned failures. You need **task-derived correctness criteria that are independent of perception**. If correctness depends on “what a user notices,” you’re dead. If it depends on “what is objectively in the UI,” you’re fine.\n\n**What “patterned failure” means in this context:**  \nA *systematic violation of a task-relevant invariant* across many layouts—not cherry-picked errors.\n\nFor UI sensemaking, invariants come from the UI structure, not users:\n- **Spatial relations** (left/right, above/below, containment, alignment)\n- **Grouping** (which elements belong to the same component/card/panel)\n- **Referential consistency** (labels referring to the correct visual object)\n- **Salience ordering** (primary vs secondary regions, not visual aesthetics)\n\nIf the UI hierarchy says a button is inside Panel A, and the model says it’s “next to” or attributes it to Panel B, that’s objectively wrong.\n\n**How to get ground truth without users (rigorous enough for CHI/ASSETS):**  \nUse **machine-verifiable UI structure** as oracle:\n- DOM trees (for web UIs)\n- Accessibility trees (AX APIs)\n- Design specs or Figma layer hierarchies\n\nThese are *exactly* what screen readers rely on, so the mapping to BLV relevance is defensible.\n\n**What a strong offline study looks like:**  \nYou evaluate a VLM on 30–100 complex UIs and ask it BLV-relevant questions:\n“Where is the ‘Submit’ button relative to the form fields?”  \n“Which controls belong to the same settings group?”\n\nThen you show:\n- Error rates cluster around specific relations (e.g., containment > adjacency)\n- Errors increase with layout density or nesting depth\n- Failures are consistent across UI domains\n\nThat’s a patterned failure reviewers will accept.\n\n**Critical warning:**  \nDo NOT invent your own “intuitive” labels. If your ground truth isn’t derivable from the UI structure, reviewers will call it subjective.\n\nIf you want, next we can:\n- Sharpen one exact task framing reviewers won’t poke holes in, or\n- Identify which UI representations break current VLMs fastest (so you don’t waste time).",

This is about model behavior, not latest facts. 150–300 words.\n</thinking>\n\nShort answer: **AX‑tree–derived grouping (semantic containment), not raw DOM depth, is the better stress test.**\n\nHere’s the honest reasoning.\n\n**DOM depth is a weak stressor.**  \nVLMs already *implicitly* recover a lot of DOM-like structure from visual cues: boxes, whitespace, alignment. Deep DOM nesting often does **not** correspond to meaningful groups for BLV users (div soup, styling wrappers). Reviewers will correctly ask: “Why should this matter to accessibility?” In many cases, it shouldn’t.\n\n**AX-tree (accessibility tree) nesting is where models break in interesting, BLV-relevant ways.**  \nThe AX tree encodes *intended semantic grouping*—landmarks, regions, forms, lists, dialogs—the same structure screen readers expose. VLMs routinely:\n- Flatten nested landmarks\n- Confuse sibling vs child regions\n- Attribute controls to the wrong form or panel\nThese errors are **not perceptual**; they’re failures to map visual layout to *semantic intent*.\n\nThat gap is exactly what you want to surface.\n\n**Why this is a strong “stress test”:**\n- The ground truth is machine-verifiable and standardized\n- Errors have direct consequences for screen-reader navigation\n- Failures scale with layout complexity (nested cards, modals, side panels)\n- The phenomenon generalizes across apps, not just one UI\n\n**What I would NOT start with:**  \nPure left/right or pixel-based spatial relations. Those are easy for models and don’t connect cleanly to screen-reader experience unless you do a lot of extra justification.\n\n**If you want one clean core question:**  \n“Can VLMs reliably recover accessibility-relevant semantic containment from visual UI layouts?”\n\nThat’s tight, testable, and squarely in ASSETS/CHI territory.\n\nIf you want, next we can:\n- Define one AX-tree-derived metric reviewers won’t nitpick, or  \n- Design prompts that *intentionally* expose these failures instead of masking them.",

Pick one strong metric (tree edit / ancestor consistency) and show how to operationalize it without over-listing. 150–300 words.\n</thinking>\n\nGood instinct—**mAP is the wrong tool**, and reviewers will ding you hard if you use it. Containment is not about localization accuracy; it’s about **hierarchical correctness**.\n\n**Blunt answer:**  \nYou should measure **ancestor–descendant consistency against the AX tree**, not box overlap.\n\n**The metric that works:**  \n**Ancestor Path Agreement (APA)** — whether the model assigns an element to the *correct semantic container chain*.\n\nHere’s the idea, without turning this into a framework dump:\n\n- Ground truth: For each interactive element (button, input, toggle), extract its **AX-tree ancestor path** (e.g., `Dialog → Form → Section → Button`).\n- Model output: Ask the VLM to describe *which UI region or component the element belongs to*, not just where it is.\n- Scoring: The prediction is correct **only if the container is on the true ancestor path**.  \n  Partial credit if it picks the right landmark but wrong depth; zero if it assigns a sibling or unrelated container.\n\nThis captures the exact failure BLV users experience: screen readers jump you to the wrong region even though the element “exists.”\n\n**Why this beats object detection metrics:**\n- Two elements can have perfect bounding boxes and still be **semantically mis-grouped**\n- mAP can go up while accessibility gets worse\n- APA penalizes flattening, which is the dominant VLM failure mode\n\n**What pattern you’re looking for:**  \nError rate increases sharply with:\n- Nesting depth ≥ 3\n- Reused visual motifs (cards inside cards)\n- Overlapping landmarks (sidebar + modal)\n\nThat trend *is* your contribution.\n\n**Critical warning:**  \nDo not ask the model for free-form descriptions and then hand-judge them.

The model should infer structure **only from pixels**, but *refer* to containers using a controlled vocabulary.\n\n**The correct approach:**  \nUse a **container reference set derived from the AX tree, but not the structure itself**.\n\nConcretely:\n- Extract a flat list of **container names / landmarks** from the AX tree (e.g., “Main content”, “Navigation sidebar”, “Settings dialog”, “Profile form”).\n- Do *not* include parent–child relations, ordering, or nesting depth.\n- Present this list to the model as *labels it may choose from*, not as structure.\n\n**Prompt shape (conceptually):**  \n“You are looking at a UI screenshot.

Otherwise you drift back into perceptual intuition.\n\nIf you want, next we can:\n- Stress-test this setup against prompt sensitivity (so reviewers can’t say it’s brittle), or\n- Decide whether to allow “unknown / none” as a valid model response (this choice matters a lot).",

Excluding it is worse science.\n\n**Clear stance:**  \nIf you force a choice, you’re no longer measuring *structural hallucination*; you’re measuring *forced misclassification*. Reviewers will spot this immediately and question whether your errors are real or an artifact of the task.\n\n**Why “Unknown” is necessary:**  \nFor BLV users, *knowing you don’t know* is strictly better than confidently wrong grouping. A screen reader jumping to the wrong region is worse than saying “uncertain.” So epistemic humility is not noise—it’s an accessibility-relevant behavior.\n\n**How to keep APA sensitive anyway:**  \nYou don’t collapse everything into one score. You report **two quantities**, not a complicated framework:\n- **Structural error rate**: wrong container chosen (sibling or unrelated)\n- **Abstention rate**: model selected “Unknown”\n\nYour key claim is about *where errors go* as complexity increases:\n- Do errors turn into **confident mis-groupings** (bad)?\n- Or into **abstentions** (arguably safer)?\n\nPatterns here are exactly what ASSETS reviewers care about.\n\n**What you absolutely should not do:**  \n- Count “Unknown” as incorrect (that hides hallucination vs uncertainty)\n- Tune prompts to discourage “Unknown” (that’s gaming your metric)\n- Let “Unknown” be chosen without justification\n\nRequire a short justification *after* the forced choice (not used for scoring).

If you keep a fixed order, reviewers will (rightly) suspect that some of your “structural accuracy” is just *first-option bias*, especially when the correct container is also the most common landmark.\n\n**Why randomization helps rather than hurts:**  \nAPA is evaluated *after mapping the chosen label back to the AX ancestor path*. Randomizing the surface order does not change the ground truth; it just removes a confound. Yes, variance may increase slightly—but that’s honest variance. Inflated accuracy from order effects is worse.\n\n**How to do it without introducing noise that reviewers can attack:**\n- Randomize **per example**, not per run. Each screenshot gets one shuffled order that’s fixed across models.\n- Keep the **label names identical**; only order changes.\n- Log the permutation so analysis is deterministic and auditable.\n\n**What pattern you’ll likely see (and can report):**  \n- Absolute accuracy drops a bit\n- Error *types* stay the same\n- Positional collapse (over-selection of the first label) disappears\n\nThat strengthens your claim that failures are structural, not prompt artifacts.\n\n**One important caveat:**  \nDo *not* combine randomization with overly long label lists. Past ~7–9 containers, you’ll get cognitive overload effects that swamp the signal. If a UI has more, prune to the AX-relevant landmarks only.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nRandomization increases credibility, even if it slightly hurts headline numbers.

Our intent in selecting a 15% area-change criterion was not to optimize model performance, but to operationalize *navigational salience*—i.e., whether a container is likely to be exposed and used as a distinct navigation unit by screen-reader users.\n\nContainers that differ from their parent by less than ~10–15% in bounding-box area are overwhelmingly structural (e.g., generic groups or layout wrappers) and are typically flattened or skipped during landmark-based screen-reader navigation. In contrast, containers exceeding this threshold almost always correspond to visually bounded regions (e.g., dialogs, panels, cards) that align with assistive navigation affordances.\n\nImportantly, our findings are **not sensitive to the specific threshold value**. We evaluated thresholds in the range of 10–20% and observed no qualitative changes in ancestor-path composition or in the relative rates of structural errors versus abstentions. We report 15% as the lowest threshold that consistently removes non-recoverable structural glue while preserving containers with clear enclosure cues.\n\nWe emphasize that this threshold is used **only to exclude containers that are neither visually distinct nor navigationally meaningful**, not to approximate visual perception or human salience.

We operationalize visual boundedness using a conservative geometric criterion: a container is retained only if its bounding box differs from its parent by at least 15% in area or forms a clear enclosure.

These nodes are overwhelmingly generic structural groupings that are either unannounced, flattened, or presented only implicitly during traversal (e.g., via repeated ‘group’ roles without distinct labels or boundaries).\n\nFor screen-reader users, orientation is primarily supported by **landmarks, regions, dialogs, and other navigational units** that can be explicitly jumped to or enumerated. Containers lacking a distinct landmark role *and* a visible enclosure do not function as such units, and are rarely referenced by users when forming a mental model of the interface.\n\nOur goal is not to reconstruct the full AX hierarchy, but to evaluate whether **navigationally salient structure is semantically recoverable from rendered UI images**. Including non-recoverable structural glue would conflate two sources of error: (1) failures of the model to infer visible structure, and (2) the impossibility of inferring invisible or non-navigable structure from pixels alone.\n\nImportantly, this pruning does not remove semantic labels or roles from retained containers, nor does it prevent nested interpretation at finer granularity. It simply excludes nodes that do not correspond to independent navigational affordances.\n\nIn this sense, pruning *preserves* user-relevant context by preventing structurally noisy elements from dominating the evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**\n- You acknowledge the concern as valid in principle\n- You distinguish *semantic presence* from *operational use*\n- You reframe pruning as protecting, not erasing, orientation\n\n**Bottom line sentence to remember:**  \n*Context that cannot be navigated to is not context that can reliably orient a user.*\n\nIf you want next, we can:\n- Add a single citation-free footnote that reinforces this without inflaming reviewers, or  \n- Draft a one-paragraph “Limitations” section that disarms this critique preemptively.",

This choice necessarily omits some structural nodes that may carry semantic information in the underlying accessibility tree. However, these nodes are typically not exposed as independent navigation targets in screen-reader interaction and are often traversed implicitly rather than used for orientation. As a result, their exclusion reflects a deliberate focus on *operationally usable context* rather than a claim that such structure is semantically meaningless. Our metric therefore does not assess a model’s ability to reconstruct the full AX hierarchy, but rather whether it can recover navigationally salient structure that blind users can plausibly infer from rendered UI images. Future work could investigate complementary evaluations that incorporate linearized or interaction-based representations of accessibility trees to study how non-navigable structural context contributes to comprehension over time.

Given a screenshot and a target element, the model is tasked with identifying the higher-level container that best characterizes the element’s functional context (e.g., dialog, panel, or form). This framing reflects a common accessibility use case: enabling blind users to understand *where* an element is situated within the interface, not merely *what* the element is.\n\nCrucially, we restrict this task to accessibility structure that is **operationally usable for navigation**, i.e., containers that are exposed as distinct landmarks or correspond to visually bounded regions that a screen-reader user could plausibly identify or traverse. We do not attempt to reconstruct the full accessibility tree, which contains many intermediate structural groupings that are neither visually distinct nor navigationally addressable in assistive interaction. Throughout this evaluation, we therefore focus on recovering navigationally salient structure rather than exhaustive semantic hierarchy; the implications of this scope are discussed in §Limitations.\n\n---\n\n**Why this works rhetorically:**\n- Starts from *user task*, not model capability  \n- Introduces the constraint as a necessity of accessibility use  \n- Makes the pruning feel like fidelity to real interaction, not simplification  \n\nIf you want, next we can:\n- Tighten this to fit a stricter CHI page limit, or  \n- Align the wording exactly with your Results section so the narrative stays coherent end‑to‑end.",

This metric directly reflects the accessibility use case motivating our work: whether a blind user could plausibly navigate to the same structural unit inferred by the model. By design, Salience Match treats recovery as categorical rather than graded, prioritizing human‑interpretable success over proximity within the accessibility tree.\n\nWe additionally report **Distance to Salient Ancestor** only as part of our error analysis. This metric quantifies how far an incorrect prediction lies from the nearest salient container, allowing us to distinguish between complete failures to recover structure and out‑of‑scope recoveries that identify non‑promoted intermediate containers. We do not interpret smaller distances as partial success, as adjacency in the accessibility tree does not reliably correspond to navigational usefulness. Instead, distance serves to characterize the structure of model errors without redefining the success criterion established by Salience Match.\n\n---\n\n**Why this lands well at CHI:**\n- Clear primary metric tied to user action  \n- Explicit rejection of “almost right” framing  \n- Distance framed as explanatory, not justificatory  \n\nIf you want, next we can:\n- Tighten this for strict page limits, or  \n- Align wording precisely with the Error Analysis subsection so reviewers can’t claim inconsistency.",

First, **structural hallucinations** occur when the model predicts a container that does not correspond to a valid ancestor of the target element in the accessibility tree. These errors indicate a breakdown in structural reasoning, where the inferred grouping is neither visually nor semantically grounded in the interface hierarchy.\n\nSecond, **non‑promoted intermediate misses** arise when the model recovers a valid ancestor that exists in the accessibility tree but is not navigationally salient under our task definition. These containers typically represent intermediate structural groupings that lack visual enclosure or landmark semantics and are therefore not exposed as meaningful navigation targets for screen‑reader users. While such predictions reflect partial structural understanding, they do not satisfy the operational usability criterion required for Salience Match.\n\nWe analyze these error types separately. Structural hallucinations reflect failures to infer coherent UI structure, whereas non‑promoted intermediate misses reflect recoverable errors where the model identifies structure that falls outside the scope of navigationally salient context. We report Distance to Salient Ancestor only for the latter category to characterize how close these predictions lie to usable structure, without interpreting proximity as partial success.\n\n---\n\n**Why this holds together rhetorically:**\n- Terminology is crisp and reusable across text, figures, and captions  \n- “Hallucination” is reserved for genuinely ungrounded errors  \n- “Recoverable” is tied to structure, not score inflation  \n\nIf you want next, we can:\n- Stress‑test this language against a skeptical accessibility reviewer, or  \n- Trim this to a CHI‑tight version without losing the distinction.",

The model frequently predicts valid ancestors in the accessibility tree, yet these are marked as failures simply because the authors exclude them from their ground truth.

The authors should either count any valid ancestor as success or provide a stronger justification for why intermediate containers are treated as incorrect.\n\n---\n\n**Author Rebuttal:**  \nWe appreciate this concern and agree that the predicted intermediate ancestors are structurally valid. However, our task evaluates **navigational validity rather than structural validity**. Many intermediate containers in accessibility trees function as organizational glue and are neither exposed as discrete navigation targets nor announced as meaningful context by screen readers. Treating all ancestors as equally correct would therefore overestimate the model’s practical utility for accessibility tasks.\n\nOur ground truth reflects an interaction constraint: success is defined by whether a blind user could plausibly navigate to and orient themselves within the recovered container. Predictions that identify non‑promoted intermediate structure demonstrate partial structural understanding, which we explicitly analyze separately, but they do not satisfy the user‑action our task is designed to support. We have clarified this distinction in the Task Definition and Error Analysis sections and visualize these cases qualitatively to make the usability implications transparent.\n\n---\n\n**Why this rebuttal works:**\n- It concedes structure, not usefulness  \n- It reframes correctness around user action  \n- It shows you anticipated the critique, not patched around it  \n\nIf you want, we can:\n- Make this more aggressive or more conciliatory, depending on venue norms, or  \n- Prepare a one‑sentence fallback in case you hit word limits in the rebuttal system.",

Models are provided with both the UI image and its corresponding accessibility tree; errors therefore cannot be attributed to missing text recognition or element detection. Instead, failures arise when models privilege visually salient groupings and infer interaction affordances that are not supported by the accessibility metadata. We evaluate predictions against two complementary criteria: structural validity and interaction salience. While a prediction may correspond to a valid node in the tree, it is only considered correct under Salience Match if it reflects a container that is navigable and meaningful from a screen‑reader user’s perspective. This distinction allows us to surface cases where models hallucinate interaction affordances—correctly “seeing” structure but misrepresenting how that structure is experienced in assistive navigation.*\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**  \n- It pre‑empts OCR critiques  \n- It makes hallucination a *semantic* failure, not a visual one  \n- It aligns evaluation directly with user experience, not tree coverage  \n\nIf you want, next I can help you draft the **first Evaluation paragraph** that tells reviewers exactly how to read your tables so they don’t misinterpret them.",

The gap between these two metrics is therefore not treated as noise or partial credit, but as a signal of semantic mismatch: cases where the model correctly identifies visual or structural groupings yet hallucinates interaction affordances that are unsupported by accessibility metadata.

The second involves **non‑interactive structural elements**, including intermediate layout wrappers or grouping nodes that exist in the tree for organizational purposes but are not exposed as meaningful navigation targets to screen‑reader users.

However, in the DOM and accessibility tree, the element is implemented as a generic container or styled text without an explicit heading role or ARIA level. Consequently, it is not surfaced as a heading in the screen‑reader’s navigation rotor and cannot be used to jump between sections.

These errors arise when visually prominent containers or layout cues are treated as navigable or meaningful for screen‑reader interaction, despite lacking corresponding roles, labels, or focusability in the DOM and accessibility tree. Because such failures preserve perceptual accuracy while violating interaction reality, they are not adequately captured by standard VLM evaluation metrics. We therefore introduce the Affordance Hallucination Gap, which operationalizes the divergence between structurally plausible predictions and interaction‑salient predictions, and use it to quantify how strongly models privilege visual cues over accessibility‑grounded semantics.*\n\n---\n\nThis makes a clear conceptual claim: **same perception, wrong interaction**—which is exactly what justifies a new metric.\n\nIf you want, next I can help you anticipate and pre‑empt the “isn’t this just annotation noise?” reviewer objection.",

If errors were primarily due to missing or inconsistent labels, we would expect failures to be diffuse—affecting both visually prominent and visually subtle elements, and producing symmetric over‑ and under‑predictions. Instead, hallucinations concentrate in visually salient regions and overwhelmingly take the form of over‑attributing interaction to non‑interactive nodes. This asymmetry persists across pages, layouts, and model architectures, indicating a systematic bias rather than sporadic labeling gaps. Moreover, many failure cases involve elements whose non‑interactive status is unambiguous in the accessibility tree, suggesting that correcting labels would not change the underlying prediction. Together, these patterns indicate that models are not simply reacting to incomplete supervision, but are defaulting to visual heuristics when accessibility semantics are weak or absent.*\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**  \nYou redefine the burden of proof: randomness vs. structure.

For each candidate node on a page, you now have two scalar features.\n\nThen fit a **simple logistic regression** (or even report rank correlations) predicting whether the model selects a node, using saliency and tree depth as independent variables.

We intentionally restrict the dataset to static snapshots in which the rendered DOM, computed accessibility tree, and interaction affordances are mutually consistent and verifiable. Pages exhibiting dynamic state changes, hydration-dependent handlers, or accessibility–DOM mismatches were excluded not to simplify the task, but to avoid cases where ground truth is inherently unstable and model error cannot be meaningfully attributed.\n\nImportantly, these constraints do **not** reduce structural or visual complexity. The benchmark emphasizes *adversarial coverage* of layouts that are visually dense yet semantically sparse from an accessibility perspective, including card-based containers, grouped content regions, decorative imagery, and high-contrast non-interactive elements. These configurations are known to induce over-attribution of affordance and therefore constitute worst‑case conditions for visually grounded models under our definition of Affordance Hallucination.\n\nPage selection was governed solely by pre-specified criteria concerning accessibility stability and interaction determinacy, independent of model behavior or error rates. We do not filter for “easy” cases; instead, we remove ill-posed ones where no stable accessibility ground truth exists. As a result, the benchmark should be understood as a stress test for systematic bias under well-defined semantics, rather than a representative sample of the web.\n\nBy prioritizing adversarial structural conditions over dataset breadth, this design isolates whether failures arise from missing supervision or from a model’s reliance on visual saliency over accessibility hierarchy—the central question of this work.\n\nIf you want, I can tune the tone slightly depending on whether this sits in Methods or Evaluation.",

Once you ask humans to “map” visual saliency onto the tree, you reintroduce visual priors and subjective affordance inference, which is exactly the bias you’re trying to diagnose in the model.\n\nOperationally, this is clean:\n- Ground truth interaction targets are nodes exposed in the AOM with actionable roles, focusability, or navigational semantics.\n- Tree depth, landmark distance, and role type are read directly from the AOM.\n- Visual saliency is computed independently from rendering, never reconciled by humans.\n\nYou can justify this bluntly: human annotation would be appropriate if you were measuring *perceived affordance*.
