If you treat this like the beginning of a long-sequence project, you’ll lose.\n\n**First priority: isolate what reviewers are actually unconvinced by.**  \nIf they asked for “additional baselines,” that means they don’t trust your empirical claims. Pick **one** missing baseline that is strongest *against* you (e.g., a well-known efficient transformer or a trivial sliding-window variant) and add it if feasible. Do not add many. Reviewers read added results skeptically; they want a sanity check, not a benchmark suite.\n\n**On novelty vs concurrent work:**  \nDo *not* argue “we were unaware.” That’s weak. Instead, draw a sharp boundary:  \n- Explicitly state what overlap exists.  \n- Then state, in one sentence, what **your paper does that theirs does not** (theoretical angle, training regime, scaling behavior, memory–quality tradeoff, or task class).  \nIf that difference isn’t real, you’re in trouble—and the rebuttal should shift to contribution framing (“independent confirmation with X advantage”), not novelty chest‑beating.\n\n**How this ties to “getting started” in efficient transformers:**  \nYour rebuttal should implicitly show taste: cite the *right* baselines (not everything), and frame efficiency along a single axis (e.g., context length vs accuracy at fixed compute). That’s how reviewers infer you belong in this space.\n\nIf you want, paste the reviewer comments or list the baselines they mentioned.

Reviewers flag it when they suspect your efficiency gains come from implementation, not ideas. You don’t need a full LongBench sweep. You need **one controlled result** showing: *our method + FA‑2 vs dense + FA‑2* at the same context length. That defuses the “you’re just slow dense attention” criticism.\n\n**LongLoRA:**  \nLongLoRA is a fine‑tuning strategy, not an attention mechanism. A head‑to‑head on LongBench is overkill and likely infeasible in rebuttal time. Instead, clearly state whether your method is orthogonal to LongLoRA. If possible, add **one small experiment** or a statement like: “our mechanism applies at pretraining/inference and can be combined with LoRA-based adaptation.” Reviewers mainly want to know you understand the distinction.\n\n**BigBird concern:**  \nA new complexity proof won’t help. BigBird already has O(n) arguments; reviewers are asking about *structural novelty*, not asymptotics. What you must do is **explicitly contrast the sparsity pattern** and explain what behavior yours enables that BigBird cannot (e.g., learned global tokens vs fixed, dynamic routing, task-adaptive sparsity). One sharp paragraph + a diagram beats math here.\n\n**Priority order given your constraints:**\n1. One FA‑2‑controlled empirical comparison.\n2. One crisp, structural distinction from BigBird.\n3. De‑emphasize LongBench and theory.\n\nIf you want, describe your Sparse‑Global pattern in two sentences and your current experiments. I’ll help you craft the exact rebuttal wording that reviewers will accept.",

Reviewers are already primed for it.\n\n**Lead with this framing in the rebuttal text (not buried):**  \n> “FlashAttention‑2 is an orthogonal kernel optimization. Our goal here is to isolate algorithmic sparsity effects rather than claim a faster kernel.”\n\nThen structure the comparison so it’s obviously fair:\n\n**What to run (and what *not* to claim):**\n- Compare **Dense + FA‑2** vs **Sparse‑Global (our code) without FA‑2**, *at the same sequence length*, reporting **memory usage and throughput separately from accuracy**.\n- Do **not** claim wall‑clock superiority if you don’t have it. Claim **scaling behavior**: e.g., “Dense+FA‑2 runs out of memory beyond L, while Sparse‑Global continues.”\n\nThis shifts the question from “is your kernel worse?” to “does your method enable regimes dense attention can’t reach?” Reviewers accept this.\n\n**How to defuse kernel criticism in one sentence:**\n> “We expect further speedups from integrating FA‑2–style kernels; current results reflect an unoptimized reference implementation.”\n\nThat’s acceptable in rebuttal; trying to match Tri Dao’s code is not.\n\n**BigBird contrast (tie it together):**\nWhen you describe the latent‑bridge, emphasize **dynamism**:\n- BigBird: fixed global indices, static connectivity.\n- Yours: *learned, input‑adaptive global state updated via cross‑attention.*\n\nThen connect this directly to the FA‑2 experiment:\n> “Because global tokens are dynamically updated, our model preserves long‑range adaptivity even when dense attention becomes infeasible.”\n\nThat makes the FA‑2 comparison serve the novelty argument instead of distracting from it.\n\nIf you want, paste your current rebuttal paragraph and I’ll rewrite it to sound reviewer‑proof.",

In a rebuttal, attention maps are not evidence; they’re **intuition aids**. Reviewers won’t change a novelty judgment based on a heatmap. They *will* use a heatmap to justify dismissing you if it looks cherry‑picked or decorative.\n\n**When it *is* worth including:**\n- One small figure or appendix panel.\n- Explicitly framed as *illustrative*, not proof.\n- Tied directly to a falsifiable claim already supported elsewhere.\n\nFor example:\n> “Figure X qualitatively illustrates the input‑adaptive nature of the latent‑bridge: the same global tokens attend to different regions under different inputs, unlike fixed‑index globals in BigBird. Quantitative scaling results in Table Y demonstrate the practical consequence of this adaptivity.”\n\nThat order matters: numbers first, picture second.\n\n**What not to do:**\n- Don’t argue “this shows it’s different from BigBird.” Reviewers hate that.\n- Don’t show many layers/heads. One clean example or nothing.\n- Don’t imply causal claims from the visualization.\n\n**My recommendation given limited bandwidth:**  \nPrioritize the scaling plot and the structural explanation in text.
