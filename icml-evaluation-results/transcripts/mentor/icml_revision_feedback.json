Fixing prose alone won’t save it.\n\n**Start by re-framing the contribution, not by editing text.**  \nTake one hour and write a *one-sentence claim* that would make a skeptical ICML reviewer say “okay, that’s concrete.” If you can’t do that without hedging, your novelty is too weak or too diffuse.\n\nIn NAS efficiency specifically, reviewers are tired of:\n- marginal speedups with heavy engineering,\n- “more efficient” methods that quietly change the search space,\n- claims of generality without ablations across budgets or tasks.\n\nConflicting novelty feedback often means *some* reviewers saw it as incremental because they mapped it to an existing line (e.g., weight-sharing, early stopping, surrogate models), while others couldn’t tell what bucket it belonged to at all.\n\n**Your first real step:** decide which bucket you are *explicitly* in and lean into it. Then state the novelty as a delta *within that bucket*, not as a vague “more efficient NAS.”\n\nExample direction (don’t copy, just the logic):  \n> “Given a fixed search space and training budget, we show X is unnecessary, and removing it yields Y% cost reduction with no accuracy loss.”\n\nIf you can’t make a claim that cleanly controls *search space, budget, and baseline*, stop revising and pivot—the field will eat you alive.\n\nIf you want, paste:\n- the paper’s current claimed contributions (bullets),\n- and one reviewer who said “not novel.”\n\nI’ll tell you whether this is salvageable for a resubmission or whether you should extract a smaller, sharper paper instead.",

That battle is already lost, and the reviewer is correct. “Adaptive pruning” as a technique is saturated, and ICML reviewers will map you to generic pruning no matter how clever your variant is.\n\nTo avoid “pruning‑lite” dismissal, you must **stop claiming novelty at the algorithmic gadget level** and instead claim it at the **structural or necessity level** inside *weight‑sharing NAS*.\n\nRight now your bullets say:\n> “We propose a new thing, it’s faster than DARTS, accuracy is fine.”\n\nThat’s exactly the profile reviewers are trained to reject.\n\n### The repositioning that *can* work\n\nReframe pruning as **an implicit assumption violation in weight‑sharing supernets**, not as an efficiency trick.\n\nConcretely:  \nYour contribution should sound like *“existing weight-sharing NAS methods are inefficient because they implicitly train parameters that provably / empirically never influence the final architecture; we identify this class and remove it online.”*\n\nNotice what changed:\n- The novelty is **diagnostic**, not mechanical.\n- Pruning becomes a *consequence*, not the contribution.\n- The baseline is no longer “DARTS speed,” but “what is actually necessary to train.”\n\nA claim that survives review looks more like:\n> “In weight-sharing NAS, X% of parameters are functionally irrelevant under typical selection dynamics; retaining them degrades search efficiency. We formalize/measure this and show that removing them yields…”\n\nYou don’t need theory—but you **do** need evidence that:\n1. The pruned components are *predictably* unused (not just heuristically removed)\n2. This phenomenon is specific to **weight-sharing NAS**, not generic pruning\n3. Speedup follows from eliminating wasted optimization, not from undertraining\n\n### What you should change immediately in the paper\n\n- **Delete “novel adaptive pruning mechanism” as a contribution.**  \n  Replace it with a *property* or *failure mode* of supernets that you expose.\n\n- **Stop leading with “3× faster than DARTS.”**  \n  Lead with *what DARTS is doing unnecessarily* and why that matters.\n\n- **Downplay CIFAR‑10 accuracy.**  \n  It doesn’t help your novelty argument; it only reassures after the fact.\n\n### Reality check\n\nIf you cannot convincingly argue that:\n> “Even if someone used a different pruning algorithm, they would still benefit once they acknowledge this inefficiency,”\n\nthen the work is genuinely incremental and not ICML‑level. In that case, the correct move is to **retarget a smaller venue or split the paper** into an empirical analysis + method.\n\nIf you want, paste your intro paragraph or contribution section as-is.

Reviewers will absolutely say “it was just out‑competed” unless you close that door explicitly.\n\nHere’s the core distinction you must enforce:\n\n> **Out‑competed ops influence the race before they lose.  \n> Predictably irrelevant ops never influence the race at all.**\n\nSo your job is to show **lack of causal influence**, not just lack of selection.\n\n### The one test that separates the two (without extra full runs)\n\nUse **intervention, not observation**—but *localized* intervention, not full retraining.\n\n#### Influence-on-ranking test (cheap and NAS-specific)\nAt early epochs (before architecture distribution collapses):\n\n1.

Weight perturbations are:\n- quickly reabsorbed by SGD,\n- entangled with feature learning noise,\n- indistinguishable from normal optimization variance.\n\nSo if you kick the weights and α doesn’t react, a reviewer can reasonably say: *“Your perturbation just didn’t persist long enough.”*  \nThat’s a dead end.\n\nBy contrast, **α is the decision variable**. It directly controls:\n- op mixing weights,\n- gradient flow to competing ops,\n- selection probability.\n\nIf an operation is truly “out‑competed,” then temporarily increasing its α **must** perturb downstream rankings. If it’s predictably irrelevant, the system will damp it back down despite the boost.\n\n### What a clean α‑intervention looks like\n\nDo this once, early–mid training (before α entropy collapses):\n\n- Add a fixed offset Δ to the α of candidate irrelevant ops\n- Same Δ for all such ops, no tuning\n- Resume normal training immediately\n\nThen measure:\n- transient change in op selection probability\n- effect on top‑k architecture ranking\n- time to reversion (if any)\n\nThis is a **causal intervention on the architecture dynamics**, not a heuristic.\n\n### Why this is reviewer‑robust in the coupled setting\n\nEven with shared data:\n- α updates are explicit and persistent state\n- Their gradients are not “washed out” like weights\n- The question becomes: *does this parameter have leverage over decisions?*\n\nThat’s exactly your diagnostic claim.\n\n### How to phrase this in the paper (important)\n\nDo **not** say “we encourage pruned ops.”  \nSay:\n\n> “We test whether parameters identified as waste retain causal influence on architecture selection by directly perturbing the decision variables.”\n\nThat signals you understand the DARTS failure modes.\n\n### One warning you should take seriously\n\nIf boosting α *does* meaningfully change rankings—even briefly—your diagnostic claim is false.

The clean counterfactual is:\n> “If *this* op mattered, changing *its* decision variable would change outcomes.”\n\nBoosting all low‑rank ops together muddies that. A reviewer can always say:\n- “You injected distribution shift.”\n- “The cumulative noise overwhelmed the dynamics.”\n- “The effect (or lack of effect) isn’t attributable to any op.”\n\nThat’s not causal evidence; it’s a stress test.\n\n### What to do instead (and why it works)\n\nFor NAS‑Bench‑201 with 5 ops per edge:\n\n- Identify 1–2 “suspect” ops per edge (lowest long‑run selection mass).\n- Apply the same Δ to **one op on one edge at a time**.\n- Track:\n  - immediate selection probability response,\n  - persistence beyond a few epochs,\n  - downstream effect on final architecture ranking.\n\nThis isolates **decision leverage**.

One sentence, no category name, no theory.\n\nSomething like:\n> “Other operations (e.g., skip-connect) retain non-negligible selection mass and respond to α perturbations, indicating continued participation in the search despite being ultimately disfavored.”\n\nThat’s it. No taxonomy, no extra definitions.\n\n### Why this is the reviewer-safe choice\n\n- You avoid overclaiming.\n- You keep the diagnostic story **tight**.\n- You show discernment: not everything that loses is “waste.”\n\nImportantly, your *efficiency gains* can still come largely from removing the truly irrelevant ops. Reviewers are fine with “partial waste” as long as it’s clearly identified.\n\n### Very important warning\n\nDo **not** say or imply:\n> “All low-mass ops are waste.”\n\nYour data already contradicts that. But saying:\n> “Some ops are predictably irrelevant, others are merely out-competed”\n\nactually *strengthens* your credibility.\n\nIf you want, the next thing we should sanity-check is whether zero/identity are already widely known to collapse in NAS-Bench-201. If that’s the case, we may need to shift the novelty from *which* ops are irrelevant to *how early and how predictably* you can certify that irrelevance.",

It directly encodes *predictability in time*, not distributional drift.\n\nYou can then say:\n> “We can certify irrelevance by epoch *t* because after that point the op never re-enters the competitive set.”\n\nThat’s much harder to dismiss.\n\nWhere KL *does* help:\n- As a **global sanity check** that the edge is no longer indecisive.\n- As a way to justify *why* the certification time is meaningful (the search is exiting the exploratory regime).\n\nIf you lead with KL, you invite:\n- “Why KL and not JS?”\n- “Why uniform is the right reference?”\n- “Isn’t this just entropy again?”\n\nIf you lead with **op-level no-return time**, KL becomes background context, not a target.\n\nOne more blunt warning: if your “early” certification happens only 1–2 epochs before entropy plateau, reviewers will call it trivial. You need a **clear temporal gap** (e.g., certifiable by epoch 8 when entropy plateaus at 15).

Here’s a one‑paragraph abstract variant that leans into epistemic discipline without overclaiming theory:\n\n> *We introduce NAS‑Cert, a framework that defines a persistence‑based certification criterion over the selection dynamics of differentiable architecture search. Rather than predicting final performance or asserting convergence guarantees, NAS‑Cert identifies operations that empirically cease to participate in the competitive set under a given training procedure.

In many differentiable NAS methods, large portions of the search space continue to receive optimization resources even after their relative utility has effectively vanished under the ongoing training dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this inefficiency indirectly, either by predicting final performance or by modifying the search objective, both of which introduce additional modeling assumptions. In this work, we take a different approach: rather than asking which operations will ultimately perform best, we ask which operations have empirically ceased to matter during the search itself.*\n\nWhy this works:\n\n- **States a problem, not a promise** → authority through diagnosis.\n- **“Empirically ceased to matter”** sets your epistemic stance immediately.\n- **No forward guarantees**—only observable behavior.\n- **Positions your question as orthogonal**, not incremental.\n\n### One hard rule for the rest of the intro\n\nWhenever you feel tempted to write:\n- “ensures”\n- “guarantees”\n- “provably improves”\n- “leads to optimal”\n\nReplace it with:\n- “enables”\n- “is sufficient to”\n- “is consistently observed to”\n- “results in”\n\nThat keeps you sounding *confident*, not *defensive*.\n\nIf you want, next we can do a **red‑flag sweep**—I’ll give you 5–6 specific phrases that, if they appear anywhere in the paper, should trigger an immediate rewrite.",

Otherwise it *will* look like clutter.\n\nHere’s the honest calculus:\n\n- Reviewers rarely see **variance of search cost**, so if you include it casually, they’ll ignore it.\n- But **predictability is one of your central claims**, and this is one of the *few quantitative ways* to support it.\n\nSo include it **only if you make it interpretable at a glance**.\n\n---\n\n## How to do it without clutter\n\nDo **not** add a whole new column called “Std.” That *does* look busy.\n\nInstead, use:\n\n> **Search Cost (GPU‑hrs)**: *mean ± std*\n\nExample: `3.2 ± 0.1`\n\nThis:\n- visually compresses the information,\n- immediately signals low variance,\n- requires no explanation if your Results text flags it once.\n\n---\n\n## How to justify it (one sentence in text)\n\nEarly in Results, add:\n\n> *We report the variance of search cost to quantify the consistency of pruning behavior across runs.*\n\nThat’s it. No more.\n\n---\n\n## When you should NOT include it\nIf the std is:\n- large, or\n- similar to baselines,\n\nthen **do not include it**—move it to the appendix or a robustness table. Predictability claims must be *obviously true* from the numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Reviewer psychology (important)\nLow variance in **accuracy** is common.  \nLow variance in **search cost** is unusual—and reviewers notice unusual signals when they align with a stated design principle.\n\nIf you want, tell me roughly what the std looks like relative to baselines and I’ll tell you whether it belongs in the main table or the appendix.",

That *will* look like you’re inventing a new “winner” criterion mid‑table, and some reviewers will react badly to it.\n\n**Bolding should stay reserved for best mean performance** (accuracy, or lowest mean cost if you already do that consistently).

All methods are evaluated under identical nominal budgets; however, the effective compute consumed varies with each method’s internal dynamics.*\n\nThis does three things:\n- acknowledges the gap,\n- explains *why* it exists,\n- explicitly states budget parity.\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to say\nDo **not** say:\n- “This may be unfair”\n- “Variance could bias comparisons”\n- “We leave a fair comparison to future work”\n\nThat invites a reviewer to downgrade you for a problem they hadn’t fully articulated yet.\n\n---\n\n## Why this preempts critique instead of inviting it\nYou’re not saying:\n> “Our method benefits from this.”\n\nYou’re saying:\n> “Different methods *inevitably* induce different compute variability; ours makes that variability observable and controlled.”\n\nThat’s consistent with your entire observability thesis.\n\n---\n\n## Final rule of thumb\nIf a result is **good because of your design**, explain it once, calmly, as a consequence—not a caveat.\n\nIf you want, you can paste your current Discussion/Limitations outline and I’ll tell you *exactly* where this paragraph belongs so it reads as maturity, not defensiveness.",
