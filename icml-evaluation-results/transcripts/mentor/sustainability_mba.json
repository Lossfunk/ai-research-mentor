It’s too broad, overloaded with buzzwords, and reviewers will see it as hand-wavy ESG talk. You need a *narrow, decision-linked* problem with existing data and modest AI.\n\n**What you should do instead:** Anchor the project on a *business decision* that sustainability metrics are supposed to inform, then use AI only as a tool—not the contribution.\n\nA realistic starting point:\nFocus on **automating or improving one sustainability signal that firms already claim to use**, and test whether it actually correlates with a business outcome.\n\nConcrete example (don’t copy blindly, but note the structure):\nUse basic NLP to extract carbon-related disclosures from annual reports or sustainability reports, then test whether those signals predict something managers care about (cost of capital, revenue volatility, supply-chain risk, etc.).\n\nWhy this works:\n- Data is public and accessible (SEC filings, CSR reports)\n- Python skills required are modest (text cleaning, embeddings, regression)\n- The contribution is evaluative, not “inventing AI”\n- Business schools like “does this metric actually matter?”\n\n**How to start this week:**\nPick **one sustainability dimension** (carbon, water, labor) and **one business outcome**. If you can’t write both in a single sentence, you’re not ready.\n\nThen ask yourself: *What existing metric or disclosure is noisy, expensive, or lagged?* That’s where lightweight AI helps.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Which industry you care about\n- Whether this is more finance, ops, or strategy oriented\n\nI’ll tell you which ideas are viable in 3 months—and which are dead ends.",

As stated, it’s on the edge of becoming vague ESG sentiment analysis, which finance reviewers are skeptical of.\n\n**What works about the idea:**\n- Energy-sector 10‑Ks are accessible and standardized\n- CapEx is a hard, finance-relevant outcome\n- “Talk vs spend” is a question investors actually care about\n\n**What will sink it if you’re not careful:**\n- Generic “green sentiment” scores. Reviewers will call this subjective and noisy.\n- Trying to infer *intent* rather than *alignment*.\n- Overcomplicated NLP (transformers, fine-tuning). You don’t need it and can’t debug it.\n\n**How to make it viable:**\nReframe the question from *sentiment* to **specific disclosure intensity**.\n\nInstead of:  \n> “Does green sentiment correlate with CapEx?”\n\nDo something like:  \n> “Do firms that increase climate-related disclosure specificity also increase low‑carbon CapEx?”\n\nThat lets you:\n- Use keyword‑ or section‑based NLP (counts, tf‑idf, simple embeddings)\n- Focus on year‑over‑year *changes*, not levels (this matters a lot)\n- Stay firmly in empirical finance territory\n\n**Skill reality check:**\nIf you can:\n- Parse text from filings\n- Count or embed sentences\n- Run basic regressions\n\nYou’re fine. This is not an ML research project; it’s an applied measurement paper.\n\n**Non‑negotiable constraint:**  \nYou must define *how* you identify “low‑carbon CapEx” using existing line items or notes. If that’s hand-wavy, the whole project collapses.\n\nIf you want, next we can:\n- Stress-test whether CapEx data is actually extractable for your target firms\n- Kill or save this idea based on data availability (the real bottleneck)\n\nTell me which energy subsector you’re thinking about (oil & gas, utilities, renewables).",

If you try, you’ll get reviewer‑killing noise. The labels are inconsistent because the accounting itself is inconsistent.\n\n**What *does* work:** You define a *defensible proxy*, not a perfect measure—and you’re explicit about that tradeoff.\n\nFor supermajors, the only viable approach in 3 months is **category‑anchored extraction**, not free‑text mining.\n\nHere’s the workable move:\nAnchor “low‑carbon CapEx” to **company‑defined transition categories** that already appear in filings and investor materials (e.g., “renewables,” “low‑carbon solutions,” “CCUS,” “hydrogen”). Then:\n\n- Manually map each firm’s disclosed transition categories *once* (this is unavoidable)\n- Use NLP only to **track intensity and changes** in those same categories over time\n- Treat CapEx as **reported amounts or ranges**, not sentence‑level inference\n\nWhy this passes scrutiny:\n- You’re not claiming accounting precision\n- You respect firm‑specific reporting choices (reviewers care about this)\n- Your contribution is about *alignment*: does disclosure growth precede, follow, or diverge from spending?\n\nWhat will *not* pass:\n- “We trained a model to identify green CapEx sentences”\n- Mixing operational CapEx, R&D, and acquisitions without distinction\n- Cross‑firm comparisons without normalization or firm fixed effects\n\n**Key reframing you need to accept:**  \nYour paper is about *measurement credibility*, not about discovering hidden truth.

That’s a conceptual mistake, and reviewers will see through it immediately.\n\n**Why this matters:**  \nBP/Shell/TotalEnergies *define* transition CapEx strategically under EU pressure. Exxon/Chevron mostly *avoid* the label. If you force them into a common taxonomy algorithmically, you’re inventing data—not measuring it.\n\n**The correct move:**  \nTreat **definition discrepancy as the object of study**, not a nuisance to clean away.\n\nPractically, do this:\n\n- **Firm‑relative measurement only**  \n  For each firm, define low‑carbon CapEx strictly using *its own disclosed categories*. Your Python code never compares raw levels across firms—only **within‑firm changes over time**.\n\n- **Disclosure intensity ≠ spending level**  \n  Your NLP measures how much attention firms devote to transition topics *relative to their own baseline*. This avoids false comparability.\n\n- **Explicit grouping, not pooling**  \n  In analysis, separate EU majors and US majors. If you pool them without interaction terms or subgroup analysis, the project dies.\n\n**What Python should do (and not do):**\n- ✅ Track year‑over‑year changes in transition‑related language using a firm‑specific dictionary\n- ✅ Align those changes with that firm’s reported transition CapEx\n- ❌ Attempt to “normalize” Exxon’s CCUS spend to Shell’s renewables budget\n- ❌ Build a universal “low‑carbon” classifier\n\n**How this reads to a finance reviewer:**  \n“Differences in disclosure standards are economically meaningful, not noise. We therefore evaluate alignment within firms and compare patterns—not magnitudes—across regimes.”\n\nThat framing *protects* you.\n\nNext sanity check (important): are you planning 5–10 years of data?

That introduces look‑ahead bias and turns your results into a moving target. Reviewers will flag this immediately.\n\n**What you should do instead:**  \n**Freeze the construct, not the vocabulary.**\n\nConcretely:\n- Define *ex ante* (using 2018–2019 documents only) what counts as “transition activity” for **each firm**\n- Lock that definition for the entire 2018–2023 window\n- Then measure how *language usage around that fixed construct* expands, contracts, or shifts\n\nHow this works in practice (without overengineering):\n- For each firm, identify a small set of **anchor concepts** that are stable across time (e.g., CCUS, renewables, hydrogen, biofuels)\n- Allow surface terms to vary, but only if they are **semantically close** to those anchors (simple embeddings are fine; no fine‑tuning)\n- Do *not* add new anchors that only appear in later years unless you clearly label them as post‑hoc robustness checks\n\n**What not to do:**\n- Updating dictionaries every year\n- Letting 2022 terminology redefine what “low‑carbon” meant in 2018\n- Claiming you capture “emerging strategies” without separating them analytically\n\n**How this strengthens your paper:**  \nYou’re no longer asking “did firms get greener?”  \nYou’re asking: *“Given a fixed notion of transition, how did disclosure behavior change as external pressure increased?”*\n\nThat’s defensible, finance‑appropriate, and feasible.\n\nNext thing to decide: are you measuring **volume of language** or **specificity of language**?

Reviewers know this. Showing that transition language increasingly appears *near concrete financial quantities* moves you from “talk” to “accountability,” which fits your measurement‑credibility framing.\n\n**The trap to avoid:**  \nOverly clever NLP. If you start optimizing distance thresholds, parsing tables, or inferring intent from sentence structure, you’ll lose transparency—and with it, trust.\n\n**A defensible implementation that fits your skills:**\nDefine specificity as **co‑occurrence within a narrow textual window** (e.g., same sentence or adjacent sentence) between:\n- an anchor concept (CCUS, renewables, hydrogen, etc., fixed ex ante), and  \n- an explicit monetary token (currency symbols, “$”, “bn”, “million”, percentages tied to spend)\n\nThen track **within‑firm changes** in the share of anchor mentions that meet this criterion over time.\n\nWhy this works:\n- It’s mechanically simple and auditable\n- It doesn’t require you to interpret whether the number is “real CapEx”\n- It aligns naturally with your CapEx comparison without claiming precision you don’t have\n\n**Be clear about the claim:**  \nYou are not measuring spending. You are measuring **how financially grounded the disclosure has become**.\n\nThat distinction will save you in the defense.\n\nIf you want, next we can sanity‑check whether 10‑Ks alone are sufficient, or whether you *must* include sustainability reports to avoid systematic bias.",

Do **not** mix in sustainability reports as core evidence. You’ll miss some specificity—but you’ll gain credibility, which matters more for a capstone and a finance audience.\n\n**Why mixing documents will hurt you:**\nSustainability reports are:\n- Voluntary\n- Strategically curated\n- Structurally incomparable across firms and years\n\nIf you include them, a reviewer can always say: *“You’re measuring marketing effort, not disclosure discipline.”* That’s a hard attack to defend.\n\n**Why 10‑Ks are enough for your claim:**\nYour construct is **financial grounding under regulatory discipline**, not “total transition activity.”  \n10‑Ks are:\n- Audited\n- Subject to legal liability\n- Where firms are most cautious about numbers\n\nSo if specificity increases *there*, it’s meaningful.\n\n**The right compromise (important):**\nUse sustainability reports only as a **secondary validation**, not as pooled data.\n\nFor example:\n- Main results: 10‑Ks only, clean and comparable\n- Supplemental analysis: show that patterns in sustainability reports *do not contradict* (or help explain) what you see in 10‑Ks\n\nYou never average them.

Moving to **segment‑year** will almost certainly break your 3‑month timeline—and it won’t buy you enough insight to justify the pain.\n\n**Why this is a trap (specifically for 10‑Ks):**\n- Segment definitions **change over time** (mergers, reorganizations, renaming)\n- EU vs US firms disclose segments at very different levels of granularity\n- Segment tables are semi‑structured, inconsistently labeled, and often split across notes\n- You’ll end up hand‑cleaning PDFs instead of doing research\n\nThis isn’t a Python problem; it’s an accounting standards problem.

Do not run them unless the result is clean.\n\nIf you stick to this framing, your identification story is tight and honest.\n\nAt this point, you’re ready to code.

For each firm, I define a fixed set of transition anchor concepts based on pre‑period disclosures and measure the share of anchor mentions that co‑occur within a narrow textual window with explicit financial quantities (e.g., currency amounts or spending references). The metric is firm‑relative and time‑varying, designed to track changes in how concretely firms discuss transition activities under financial reporting constraints, rather than the volume of disclosure or underlying investment levels.”\n\n**Why this works:**\n- No buzzwords (no “transformers,” no “sentiment analysis”)\n- Emphasizes *ex ante* definitions and legal context\n- Makes clear you are measuring *presentation quality*, not behavior\n\n**If someone presses “Isn’t this just a word count?”**\nYour response:\n> “It’s a conditional frequency—counts only matter when transition concepts are tied to financial quantities.

Tables are:\n- Structurally inconsistent across firms and years  \n- Hard to delimit “context” without manual judgment  \n- An easy place for critics to say your algorithm inferred meaning where none exists  \n\nYour defense line:\n> “Tables were excluded because they do not provide a consistent textual unit for attributing financial quantities to transition concepts.”\n\nThat’s completely acceptable.\n\n**Footnotes (more nuanced):**  \nFootnotes *are* part of the audited filing and often contain dense, high‑quality disclosure. You can include them **if** you apply the same sentence‑level logic and accept some noise.\n\nBest practice for your setup:\n- Include footnotes that appear as continuous prose (common in accounting policy notes)\n- Exclude numeric‑only footnotes or multi‑row reconciliations\n- Treat footnotes exactly like MD&A text—no special windowing\n\n**Important transparency move (do this):**  \nState explicitly that your metric captures **narrative financial grounding**, not tabular disclosure.
