      "content": "<thinking>\nExperienced researcher. They want strategy, not basics. I should be direct about pitfalls in foundation models + science, and give a concrete starting path while addressing preprints, dual submission, OSS. Lead with assessment, then guidance. No tools needed.\n</thinking>\n\nShort answer: don’t start by building a “foundation model for science.” That’s the fastest way to burn a year and end up with a vague, unpublishable story.\n\n**Honest assessment:** This area is crowded, expensive, and reviewer-hostile unless you anchor yourself to a *specific scientific bottleneck* and show real leverage over strong domain baselines. Industry labs fail here all the time by shipping impressive models with weak scientific claims.\n\nHere’s how to start *without wasting time*:\n\nFirst, **pick one scientific domain and one concrete failure mode** (e.g., protein–ligand generalization across targets, PDE solvers under distribution shift, materials discovery with sparse labels). If you can’t articulate what existing methods systematically fail at, stop. Foundation models are only defensible when they *fix a generalization or data-efficiency problem*, not because they’re large.\n\nOn **preprints**: in this area, *preprint early* unless your lab has a strong internal venue pipeline. Reviewers expect arXiv visibility, and being scooped is common. The exception is if your contribution is primarily empirical at scale and easy to clone—then wait until you have a clear moat (data, eval, or deployment).\n\nOn **dual submission**: be careful. ML+science venues (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML vs. domain journals) have incompatible norms. Don’t dual-submit simultaneously. Instead, target an ML venue first with a methods framing; later, extend for a domain journal with deeper scientific validation.\n\nOn **open-sourcing**: open *infrastructure and pretrained weights*, not the full training recipe or proprietary data. Reviewers reward openness, but your lab needs defensible differentiation. Partial openness is the norm and acceptable.\n\n**Concrete next step:** spend 2–3 weeks reproducing the strongest baseline in one scientific subfield and identify where it breaks. Your first project should look like a *surgical strike*, not a platform.\n\nIf you want, tell me which scientific domain you’re closest to—I’ll tell you where foundation models are actually paying off vs. mostly hype.",

No tools needed.\n</thinking>\n\n**Prioritize data‑efficient fine‑tuning for specific targets.** Zero‑shot cross‑family generalization is the *sexier* story—and the worse first bet.\n\nHere’s the blunt reasoning:\n\nZero‑shot generalization across protein families is where **everyone aims** and **almost nobody convinces reviewers**. The benchmarks are leaky, family splits are contentious, and strong baselines (ESM variants, structure‑conditioned models, diffusion‑based binders) already look “good enough.” Reviewers will ask: *is this real generalization or just homology leakage?* If you don’t have a bulletproof split and massive scale, you’ll bleed time defending methodology instead of making progress.\n\nData‑efficient fine‑tuning, on the other hand, aligns perfectly with your **proprietary assay data**. That’s your moat. You can make a clean, testable claim: *given a small amount of target‑specific data, foundation models adapt faster / more stably / with better uncertainty than task‑specific models.* This is easier to evaluate rigorously and harder to dismiss.\n\nFrom a foundation‑model angle, this is still legitimate: the scientific contribution is **how priors transfer under realistic data scarcity**, not raw zero‑shot performance. Reviewers in both ML and drug discovery are much more receptive to that framing right now.\n\nA good surgical strike here looks like:\n- One or two protein families\n- Realistic low‑data regimes (dozens–hundreds of assays, not thousands)\n- Strong non‑FM baselines\n- A clear failure mode you fix (instability, overfitting, miscalibration)\n\nOnce you *win* that, you can extend to cross‑family zero‑shot as a secondary story—on much firmer ground.\n\nIf you want, next we can sharpen this into a single crisp research question reviewers won’t roll their eyes at, or talk about how much of the assay data you need to credibly claim “data‑efficient.”",

I should be firm: full weight release is risky; explain why fine-tuned weights leak signal; give a concrete, defensible compromise that reviewers accept and legal teams tolerate.\n</thinking>\n\n**Blunt answer:** do *not* release fine‑tuned weights trained on proprietary assay data. That risk is real, and anyone telling you otherwise hasn’t sat in a pharma IP review.\n\nFine‑tuned parameters *do* encode competitive signal—especially in low‑data regimes where the model bends sharply toward your assays. Even if inversion attacks are impractical, competitors don’t need exact labels; they need directional bias (what binds, what doesn’t, what chemotypes are favored). Legal will be right to block this, and reviewers won’t penalize you if you’re transparent.\n\nThe defensible balance that works in practice is:\n\n- **Open‑source the base model or adaptation mechanism**, not the adapted weights. This means releasing the pretrained FM (or using an existing open one) plus the *method* for efficient adaptation (e.g., adapters, low‑rank updates, conditioning scheme).\n- **Release a full training/eval pipeline on public or synthetic datasets** that mirrors your proprietary setup. Reviewers care about reproducibility of *claims*, not access to your data.\n- **Report proprietary results as held‑out evidence**, clearly labeled. This is normal in drug discovery; NeurIPS/ICLR reviewers accept it when the public results stand on their own.\n\nWhat *not* to do: vague “we can’t release for IP reasons” without strong public baselines. That triggers skepticism.\n\nA useful rule of thumb: if the fine‑tuned artifact gives someone a shortcut to *where to spend wet‑lab dollars*, don’t release it.\n\nIf you want, I can help you phrase the openness section so it satisfies reviewers while pre‑empting the inevitable “why not release weights?” complaint.",

Early staking only helps if others can’t easily reproduce *anything* you show, which is rarely true in protein–ligand modeling.\n\nReviewers ask two questions in order:\n1. *Does this method work in a setting I can inspect?*\n2. *Do the proprietary results suggest upside beyond that?*\n\nIf you invert that order, you lose credibility.\n\nWhat you should optimize for is a **trigger condition**, not perfection:\n- One public benchmark where your adaptation method beats strong baselines *in the low‑data regime*\n- Clean ablations showing the mechanism matters\n- Then add proprietary results as confirmatory evidence\n\nAt that point, preprint immediately. You’ve established the methodological claim, and the proprietary data now *strengthens* rather than substitutes for it.\n\nOne more blunt point: in this subfield, being scooped is less likely than being ignored. A solid, inspectable public result buys attention; an early proprietary‑heavy preprint mostly buys skepticism.\n\nIf you want, next we can define what “strong enough” public evidence looks like so you don’t over‑optimize and slip your timing window.",

If you show a marginal win there, reviewers will assume tuning or leakage. Worse, it says nothing about *adaptation*—just that you trained well.\n\nFor your specific claim (data‑efficient fine‑tuning), **superior few‑shot transfer across a *diverse set of public assays*** is far more convincing. That directly stress‑tests the mechanism under distribution shift and data scarcity—the exact thing foundation‑model priors are supposed to help with.\n\nWhat “strong enough” looks like in practice:\n- Multiple unrelated targets (not just kinases with cosmetic differences)\n- Very low‑data regimes where conventional fine‑tuning collapses\n- A clear pattern: your method is consistently better or more stable, not a single lucky win\n\nYou can still *include* PDBbind, but only as a **sanity check**, not the headline. One table, no SOTA chest‑beating.\n\nReviewers are far more likely to say “this teaches us something” when they see robustness across tasks than when they see +0.01 RMSE on a tired benchmark.\n\nIf you want, tell me which public assay collections you’re considering—I can tell you which ones reviewers trust and which ones they quietly discount.",

Use TDC ADMET only as supporting evidence, and be very selective with ChEMBL.\n\nHere’s the honest reviewer psychology:\n\n**FS‑MOL** was *designed* to test few‑shot transfer across unrelated targets, with careful splits and low‑data regimes. Reviewers already interpret wins there as evidence that a model’s prior matters. If your adaptation mechanism helps consistently on FS‑MOL, you’ve essentially proven the core claim in a setting people trust. This is exactly the benchmark that counters the “industrial anecdote” critique.\n\n**TDC ADMET** is useful but weaker. The tasks are heterogeneous, labels are noisy, and improvements often come from feature engineering or multitask leakage rather than better priors. A reviewer will accept gains here as *supporting*, not primary, evidence. Don’t hang your main claim on ADMET.\n\n**ChEMBL subsets** are a double‑edged sword. They *can* be high‑trust if—and only if—you:\n- Choose genuinely diverse targets\n- Enforce brutal low‑shot regimes\n- Make splits that avoid scaffold and target leakage\n\nOtherwise, reviewers will assume you cherry‑picked forgiving assays. If you use ChEMBL, frame it as a **stress test** that mirrors your proprietary setup, not as a benchmark win.\n\n**My recommendation:**  \nAnchor the paper on FS‑MOL as the main public proof. Add a small, carefully justified ChEMBL slice to show realism. ADMET goes in the appendix or as secondary evidence.\n\nThat combination signals taste, not benchmark chasing—and that’s exactly what reviewers reward in this space.",

A win there can still be dismissed as “the model crosses the memorization threshold somewhere between 10 and 100.” They don’t actually reveal *how* adaptation behaves.\n\nA **1→30 shot curve** directly tests your hypothesis: that the foundation prior plus your adaptation mechanism provides *graceful improvement under extreme data scarcity*. If the curve is smooth, monotonic, and clearly separated from baselines at 1–5 shots, that’s very hard to explain away with scaffold memorization.\n\nWhy not go to 50 or 100? Because above ~30 shots, reviewers mentally switch to “regular fine‑tuning regime,” and your story weakens. More points there add noise, not insight.\n\nTwo important constraints to keep this from backfiring:\n- Use **strict scaffold splits** and say so prominently.\n- Aggregate across multiple targets and plot *means with variance*, not cherry‑picked curves.\n\nDone right, this looks like mechanism‑level evidence, not benchmark gaming.\n\nIf you want, next we can decide whether this curve belongs in the main paper or as a single, dense figure reviewers can’t ignore.",

This separation is intended to ensure that all methodological claims can be independently verified on public data, while proprietary results serve to assess practical relevance rather than to establish the core contribution.\n\nThis paragraph does three critical things reviewers care about:\n1.

Instead of appeasing reviewers, you give them a new axis to probe. Worse, reproducibility committees can’t meaningfully validate such artifacts, so they don’t actually help you check boxes.\n\nFrom an IP perspective, distilled weights are also **not safe**.

With the current reproducibility norms, reviewers subconsciously penalize “code now, weights later.” Even if they don’t say it explicitly, it nudges your paper toward the “promising but incomplete” bucket. Releasing weights upfront signals confidence and maturity.\n\nSecond, **weights don’t meaningfully constrain revisions**. Any revision you’d make post‑review—ablations, extra baselines, minor fixes—can be done with new checkpoints. No one expects the initial weights to be the final artifact.

Do *not* use a personal account.**  \nAn anonymous org is now the standard and is strictly safer than a personal or “temporary” account.\n\nHere’s why this is the right call:\n\nA personal HF account—even if freshly created—almost always leaks identity through username choice, linked GitHub history, prior models, or social graph. Reviewers are explicitly told not to investigate, but you shouldn’t rely on that. An anonymous org is clean by construction and signals intentional compliance with double‑blind norms.\n\nThe community expectation for ICML‑era releases is:\n- **Anonymous org during review**\n- **Official institutional org post‑acceptance**\n- Personal accounts are for individuals, not anonymous scholarly artifacts\n\nUsing a personal account also creates awkward cleanup later (transfer ownership, broken links, confusing provenance). With an org, you can simply freeze it as archival and mirror cleanly.\n\nSo the rule of thumb is:\n- **Before camera‑ready:** anonymous org only  \n- **After camera‑ready:** keep the anonymous org as archival; introduce official org as the living mirror  \n- **Never:** personal accounts for double‑blind releases\n\nYou’re already following best practice here.
