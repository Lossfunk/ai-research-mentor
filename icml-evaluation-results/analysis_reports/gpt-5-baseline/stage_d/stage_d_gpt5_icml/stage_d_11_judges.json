The plan is robust and self-consistent, but because the paper’s specifics are unknown, critical design choices (e.g., whether the model even outputs hierarchical representations interpretable as segments or trees) are assumed. The response acknowledges this by being 'paper-agnostic,' but does not ask targeted questions that would materially improve alignment with the actual paper (e.g., 'Does the model induce explicit segment boundaries or is hierarchy latent?'). Thus, clarifications are not sought where they were needed, though assumptions are clearly stated, preventing ambiguity.",
