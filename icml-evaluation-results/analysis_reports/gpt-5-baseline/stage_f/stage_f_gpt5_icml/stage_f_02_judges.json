These questions are not generic but specifically tailored to common pitfalls in LLM/compression research (e.g., license compatibility of quantized derivatives, TOS violations in web-scraped data, KV-cache leaks). The agent also explicitly states assumptions by offering a detailed, actionable checklist and templates grounded in real-world compliance requirements (e.g., NeurIPS/ICML guidelines, SBOM, IRB documentation). This structure ensures that once the user supplies the requested information, the feedback will be precise and materially improve the paper’s compliance posture.",
