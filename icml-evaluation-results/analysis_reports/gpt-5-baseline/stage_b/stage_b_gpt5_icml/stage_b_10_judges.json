          "rationale": "The response provides exceptional depth in addressing prior work, novelty opportunities, and ethical risks, with highly actionable steps like the minimal responsible path and specific technical suggestions, perfectly calibrated to stage B and the privacy constraint. It acts as a supportive mentor by encouraging original contributions while being realistic about established areas. Minor weaknesses include the lack of tool use (e.g., no web_search for the most recent prior work, relying on indicative examples) and no explicit clarifying questions about the user's data access or expertise, leaving slight assumptions unstated.",
