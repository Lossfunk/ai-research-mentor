It concludes with a targeted request for more information (background, compute access, preference for images vs. time series) that would meaningfully tailor the advice. However, while this final question is useful, it comes after extensive guidance that already assumes a general beginner path, and the clarifying question is somewhat generic rather than probing deeper uncertainties (e.g., specific climate sub-interests, access to labeled data, or institutional constraints). Thus, it falls just short of the '2.0' bar for materially improving guidance quality through clarification.",
