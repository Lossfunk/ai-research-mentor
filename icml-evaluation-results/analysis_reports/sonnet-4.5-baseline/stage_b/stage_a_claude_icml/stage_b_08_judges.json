          "rationale": "The response provides an exceptional level of depth and structure, offering a thorough novelty assessment, detailed risk analysis, multiple potential applications, technical options, key questions, and a phased actionable plan that equips the user well for stage B research exploration. It acts as a supportive mentor with encouraging yet realistic tone, tailored to an unknown researcher persona. Minor weaknesses include the truncation in the platforms list, which leaves some information incomplete, and the absence of tool usage (e.g., web_search) despite expectations, potentially missing fresher data on platforms; it also assumes text log focus without explicit clarification questions.",
