The agent provided a comprehensive, template-style response assuming the paper is for NeurIPS and that it involves training on legal data with specific risks (e.g., unauthorized practice of law, PII, bias). However, the agent made critical unstated assumptions: it presumes the model is trained on real legal documents, is intended for practical legal assistance, and targets NeurIPS 2024/2025 specifically. The user did not specify the conference(s), model type (e.g., fine-tuned vs. prompt-based), data sources, or intended use (e.g., research-only vs. deployable tool). These missing clarifications are essential because ethics requirements vary significantly by venue (e.g., ACL vs. NeurIPS vs. ICML) and by whether the work involves human subjects, real legal data, or deployment. Without clarifying questions or explicit assumptions, the guidance is potentially misleading or inapplicable.",
