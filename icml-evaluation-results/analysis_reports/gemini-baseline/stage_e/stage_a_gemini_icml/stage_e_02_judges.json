While the advice is generally sound and actionable, it assumes a standard interpretation of 'modest gains' and applies generic academic framing strategies without tailoring to potential nuances in the user's specific results or goals. Because the user’s prompt did not strictly require clarification (the task is reasonably well-defined), the absence of probes is not penalized harshly, but the lack of explicit assumptions or targeted questions prevents a higher score.",
