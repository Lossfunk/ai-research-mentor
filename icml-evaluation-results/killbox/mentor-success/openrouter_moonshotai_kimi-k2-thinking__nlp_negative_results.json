Need to give a clear interpretation and warn against overengineering. Lead with judgment, then how to act on it.\n</thinking>\n\nThis is **not noise** if it’s stable—but it only points to an architectural fix if the localization is *clean and interpretable*. Otherwise it becomes post‑hoc storytelling.\n\nHere’s the honest mapping reviewers will accept:\n\n- **Conflict concentrated in embeddings / early layers** usually means *representation incompatibility* (lexicalization, morphology, script, or false friends), not optimization failure. The correct response is **representation isolation**, not fancy gradient surgery—e.g., freezing, partial sharing, or language‑conditioned embeddings. If PCGrad “fixes” this, that’s suspicious; you’re masking a modeling mismatch.\n\n- **Conflict concentrated in upper layers** points more plausibly to **task‑level or semantic interference**. In that case, selective decoupling (adapter routing, layer‑wise source weighting) is a defensible architectural follow‑up, and gradient-based diagnostics make sense.\n\nWhat you should *not* do: propose a new architecture just because you saw layerwise effects. A negative‑interference paper lives or dies on restraint. Your contribution is identifying *where and why* transfer breaks, not “here’s yet another fix.”\n\nMy advice: if the layerwise pattern is sharp, consistent across seeds and language pairs, and lines up with linguistic intuition, you can justify a minimal intervention as evidence—not as the main claim. If it’s diffuse or unstable, stop at diagnosis. That’s still a solid story.\n\nInterpretation beats intervention here.",

      "content": "<thinking>\nExperienced NLP researcher, close to paper framing. Need to judge whether language adapters are acceptable as minimal intervention. Answer: yes, but only in a very constrained, hypothesis-testing role. Emphasize limits and how to frame to avoid “new architecture” trap.\n</thinking>\n\nUsed carefully, **language adapters are acceptable**—but only if you treat them as a *diagnostic control*, not a contribution.\n\nIf early-layer conflict really reflects representation incompatibility, then inserting **small, frozen‑backbone adapters only in the embedding / lower blocks** is a *minimal intervention*. You’re not redesigning the model; you’re locally relaxing forced sharing. Reviewers generally accept this *if* the adapters are standard and the backbone is unchanged.\n\nThe framing matters more than the method:\n\n- You’re not proposing adapters as “the solution.”\n- You’re testing a falsifiable claim: *early representational sharing causes negative transfer; relaxing it selectively reduces interference*.\n- You should show that placing adapters **only in early layers** helps, while placing them higher does not (or helps less). That alignment is what makes it convincing.\n\nWhat would cross the line:\n- Stacking multiple adapter variants and tuning them.\n- Comparing against a zoo of adapter methods.\n- Claiming general performance improvements beyond your failure regime.\n\nOne clean experiment is enough. If adapters remove the interference *exactly where gradients conflicted*, you’ve closed the causal loop. At that point, the architectural change is evidence, not the paper.\n\nIf adapters don’t help, don’t escalate. That’s your signal to stop intervening and keep the paper diagnostic.",
