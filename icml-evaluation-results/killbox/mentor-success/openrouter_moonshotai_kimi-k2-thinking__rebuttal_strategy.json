Capitalization signals to reviewers: *this is a concrete architectural component, not a metaphor*. That helps with novelty and prevents “this sounds like BigBird with different wording” pushback. But over‑capitalizing reads like branding, which can trigger skepticism.\n\n**Best practice:**\n- First occurrence (caption or main text): **“Latent‑Bridge bottleneck”**\n- Subsequent mentions: “latent‑bridge bottleneck” or just “the latent bottleneck” when clear.\n\nFor the caption specifically, I’d write:\n> “…due to its fixed‑size **Latent‑Bridge** bottleneck…”\n\nThen in the paragraph text:\n> “…a small set of latent‑bridge tokens forming a learned information bottleneck…”\n\nThat establishes both:\n- **Identity** (there is a distinct module)\n- **Function** (it’s a bottleneck, not just globals)\n\nAvoid turning it into a proper noun everywhere. You want reviewers to remember *the idea*, not the name.",

      "content": "That makes sense—it balances technical rigor with branding. One last thing: Reviewer 2 specifically asked how this 'Latent-Bridge' differs from the 'Global Tokens' in BigBird; should I address that directly in the caption or save the detailed architectural contrast for the rebuttal text?",

      "content": "<thinking>\n- Level: experienced.\n- Assessment: caption is not the place for architectural debate.\n- Need to tell them where to draw the line and how to coordinate caption + text.\n</thinking>\n\nDo **not** put the BigBird contrast in the caption. That’s the wrong venue and will look defensive.  \nHandle it **explicitly in the rebuttal text**, and let the caption do only causal attribution.\n\nHere’s the principle reviewers follow (often subconsciously):\n\n- **Caption** answers: *What am I looking at and why does it look this way?*\n- **Rebuttal text** answers: *Why is this not the same as BigBird?*\n\nIf you overload the caption with “unlike BigBird’s global tokens…”, it signals insecurity and invites line‑by‑line quibbling over wording in a place that should be factual.\n\n**What to do instead (clean separation):**\n\n- **Caption:**  \n  Name the mechanism, state the effect. Period.  \n  > “…due to its fixed‑size Latent‑Bridge bottleneck…”\n\n- **Rebuttal paragraph (responding to Reviewer 2):**  \n  Give the sharp contrast:\n  > “BigBird’s global tokens are fixed input positions with static connectivity, whereas the Latent‑Bridge tokens form a learned bottleneck that is dynamically updated via cross‑attention and shared across all positions. As a result, the attention memory is bounded by the latent size rather than sequence length, which is reflected in Fig. 2.”\n\nThat way:\n- The **figure shows** the consequence.\n- The **text explains** the distinction.\n- Reviewers don’t feel you’re arguing with them inside a caption.\n\nThis division of labor is exactly what strong rebuttals do.",
