      "content": "<thinking>\nExperienced researcher. Need decisive recommendation. Answer: yes include No-DP with clipping; it's useful and not redundant; but keep it minimal and clearly framed as diagnostic, not competitor. Explain briefly.\n</thinking>\n\n**Lead assessment:** **yes—include a No‑DP baseline *with the same clipping threshold*.** That’s a good diagnostic, not a distraction, and it will *strengthen* your story even in a privacy‑focused venue.\n\nWhy it’s worth including:\n\nThat baseline cleanly isolates **clipping bias** from **DP noise**. On heavy‑tailed synthetic data, reviewers will naturally wonder:\n> “How much of this collapse is noise vs. clipping?”\n\nA No‑DP‑but‑clipped curve answers that in one glance:\n- If No‑DP‑clipped still degrades, you’ve demonstrated bias is real.\n- If it holds up while DP collapses, you’ve isolated noise as the culprit.\n- Either way, the “double failure” narrative becomes concrete, not theoretical.\n\nThis is *not* redundant, because:\n- you are not claiming No‑DP as a competitor,\n- you are not optimizing it,\n- and you are using it to explain *why* DP behaves the way it does.\n\nHow to keep it reviewer‑safe:\n- Label it clearly as **“No‑DP (clipped)”**.\n- Do **not** tune \\(C\\) for it separately.\n- Put it in the same plot or an appendix—don’t give it rhetorical weight.\n\nWhat you should **not** include:\n- an unclipped No‑DP baseline (that invites irrelevant “why not just remove clipping?” discussions),\n- or comparisons framed as “DP vs non‑DP performance.”\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA clipped No‑DP baseline turns your explanation from a claim into evidence.  \nUsed sparingly, it signals maturity—not confusion.\n\nThat’s a strong place to stop tweaking and ship the paper.",
