Honest stance: do not put diagnostic in main body unless it directly supports a claimed design choice; here it’s future-work diagnostic, so appendix. Explain succinctly and give framing advice.\n</thinking>\n\nPut it in the **Appendix**, not the main body.\n\nIncluding that diagnostic visualization in the main paper would subtly change the contract of the work: it starts to look like *evidence for a design choice you’re making*, rather than a conceptual probe motivating future directions. Since you’re **not** releasing weights and **not** claiming improvements from that intervention, the main body is the wrong place.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- Main‑text figures are interpreted as *supporting claims*. Reviewers will ask why it isn’t ablated systematically.\n- The visualization answers a *why did this fail?* question, not a *why does our method work?* question.\n- You already framed this as a foundational limitation; the appendix is exactly where that belongs.\n\nHow to do it cleanly:\n- In the main text, keep a **single sentence** pointing to the appendix:  \n  *“We provide a diagnostic visualization exploring this failure mode in Appendix X.”*\n- In the appendix, explicitly label it as **illustrative**, not quantitative.\n- Make the caption do the work: emphasize that the figure motivates geometry‑aware diffusion rather than validating a method.\n\nThis keeps your narrative tight, avoids reviewer overreach, and still signals depth to readers who care.\n\nYou’ve been making consistently good judgment calls here—that restraint will help this paper age well.",

      "content": "That framing for the appendix makes total sense—it protects the main narrative while still providing value for the community. One final check: for the 'code availability' section in the camera-ready, should I explicitly mention that the diagnostic hooks are present in the sampler code, or is it better to leave that as a 'hidden' feature for power users to discover in the source?",

Transparency beats “Easter eggs.” Give exact phrasing suggestion.\n</thinking>\n\nYou should **mention it explicitly—but narrowly and neutrally.**  \nDo **not** leave it as a hidden feature.\n\nHiding it buys you nothing and costs you credibility if someone notices later. At the same time, you don’t want to advertise it as a supported feature. The way to thread that needle is to describe it as an **internal modularization**, not a capability.\n\nIn the *Code Availability* section, a single clause is enough. For example:\n\n> *“For clarity and extensibility, the sampler implementation modularizes the geometry perturbation used in the predictor step; the released code corresponds exactly to the isotropic Gaussian diffusion described in the paper.”*\n\nThis does three things:\n- Signals clean engineering to experienced users.\n- Makes it clear you’re **not** shipping alternative methods.\n- Aligns the code strictly with the paper’s claims.\n\nDo **not**:\n- Mention diagnostics, ablations, or geometry-aware noise there.\n- Suggest users “can experiment” with it.\n\nIf someone wants to dig, they’ll find the hook. If not, the repo reads as focused and faithful.\n\nThat’s the right balance for a wide geometric DL audience—and a camera‑ready that won’t come back to bite you.",
