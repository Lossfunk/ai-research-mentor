      "content": "Below is a clean way to place ER and DER++ so they set up your Pareto-dominant story without sounding like you’re just tuning for accuracy. You can drop these into Related Work with minimal edits.\n\nWhere to place them in your taxonomy\n- Category: Task-agnostic, online, memory-bounded rehearsal\n  - Subgroup A: Plain rehearsal (accuracy-driven, no explicit stability term) → ER\n  - Subgroup B: Distillation-augmented rehearsal (implicit stability via logit consistency) → DER++\n\nConcise descriptions and takeaways (drop-in paragraphs)\n- ER (Experience Replay; Chaudhry et al.)\n  - What it is: The canonical rehearsal baseline for task-agnostic online CL. Uses a fixed buffer (typically reservoir) and trains on a minibatch mixing stream and replay samples with standard cross-entropy.\n  - Assumptions/costs: No task IDs, no parameter growth, minimal compute, memory = images+labels only.\n  - Strengths: Strong plasticity and surprisingly competitive accuracy even with tiny buffers; establishes the accuracy–forgetting trade-off under strict budgets.\n  - Limitations for your angle: Optimizes step-wise accuracy; forgetting is only indirectly controlled. Performance depends heavily on buffer composition and order effects.\n  - Takeaway: ER is the accuracy-first anchor in the low-memory regime but does not explicitly minimize forgetting at a fixed budget—ideal as your Pareto baseline.\n\n- DER++ (Dark Experience Replay++; Buzzega et al.)\n  - What it is: Rehearsal plus logit-level distillation on buffered samples; anchors current predictions to stored past outputs to mitigate drift, alongside cross-entropy on replay and stream.\n  - Assumptions/costs: Task-agnostic and online; modest extra compute; important: storing logits increases per-sample memory (often ignored in comparisons).\n  - Strengths: Improves short-term retention and final accuracy over ER in many image CL benchmarks; strong off-the-shelf baseline in tiny-buffer settings.\n  - Limitations for your angle: Stability is encouraged indirectly via distillation, not optimized against a budgeted forgetting objective. If logits’ memory is not budgeted, DER++ effectively uses more memory than ER, confounding fairness.\n  - Takeaway: DER++ is a stability-leaning rehearsal variant but still not budget-aware; under iso-memory accounting it remains a strong but non-Pareto-optimized comparator.\n\nBridge lines that set up your claim\n- Rehearsal methods (ER, DER++) dominate accuracy under tight, task-agnostic budgets, but they do not target forgetting minimization at fixed memory and compute. ER optimizes plasticity; DER++ adds consistency but with potential hidden memory costs. We adopt an iso-budget protocol and Pareto analysis to evaluate stability–plasticity explicitly, showing gains at 20 samples per class on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet.\n- Prior gains over ER often stem from added memory (e.g., stored logits) or extra passes. We enforce iso-memory and iso-compute to isolate stability improvements from resource inflation.\n\nHow to present them in your section header and reader’s guide\n- Header: Task-agnostic online rehearsal under fixed memory\n- Reader’s guide sentence: We group rehearsal methods by whether they add explicit stability signals. ER represents plain rehearsal (plasticity-first); DER++ adds logit consistency (implicit stability). Both are evaluated under fixed buffers; we count all stored artifacts (images, labels, logits) toward memory to ensure Pareto-fair comparisons.\n\nOptional fairness note (strengthens the Pareto argument)\n- We report two views: fixed number of images (20/class) and fixed memory in MB (counting logits). Under both, we plot ACC vs forgetting (BWT) to trace the frontier. DER++’s logits are budgeted; if not, we flag the effective memory increase to avoid unfair shifts of the Pareto curve.\n\nOne-line takeaways to end the subsection\n- ER: Sets the plasticity ceiling at a given buffer but leaves forgetting unmanaged.\n- DER++: Adds consistency for stability, yet does not explicitly optimize the stability–plasticity frontier under a fixed budget.\n\nThis framing positions your method as: still within the rehearsal family, task-agnostic and online, but explicitly optimizing the stability–plasticity trade-off at fixed memory—hence Pareto-dominant rather than just accuracy-tuned.",

      "content": "Here’s a brief, defensible way to position regularization-based methods so they’re covered but clearly not central for your task-agnostic, online, fixed-budget setting.\n\nWhere to place them\n- Category: Regularization/distillation without rehearsal (EWC, SI, LwF, RWalk)\n- Reader’s guide: These methods constrain parameter updates to protect prior tasks, often assuming task boundaries and multiple passes; they underperform in task-agnostic, single-head class-incremental streams without exemplars.\n\nDrop-in paragraph (concise)\n“Regularization-based methods such as EWC, SI, and related variants stabilize learning by penalizing updates to parameters deemed important for past tasks, and distillation approaches (e.g., LwF) anchor predictions to a previous model. While attractive for their data-free promise, they typically require task boundaries to estimate importance (e.g., Fisher) and multiple passes or extra storage, conflicting with task-agnostic, online protocols. In single-head class-incremental settings without exemplars, they struggle with representation drift and class-imbalance bias, leading to substantial forgetting. Moreover, their parameter-side memory (e.g., importance buffers, teacher checkpoints) and extra compute are often unaccounted for; under iso-memory/iso-compute accounting, rehearsal-based methods consistently dominate in the low-memory regime. For these reasons, we include EWC/LwF as reference baselines but focus our analysis on budgeted rehearsal, where the stability–plasticity Pareto frontier is most relevant.”\n\nPer-method one-liners (optional inserts)\n- EWC/SI: Importance-weighted regularization that needs task boundaries or surrogate estimates; adds parameter-side state and extra passes; weak in task-agnostic single-head class-incremental without replay.\n- LwF: Distills from a previous snapshot without exemplars; requires storing/maintaining a teacher and adds compute; suffers class bias and forgetting in class-incremental streams.\n- RWalk/other variants: Tighter importance estimates but same reliance on boundaries and passes; similar limitations in online task-agnostic settings.\n\nBridge to your evaluation\n- We evaluate EWC/LwF under the same task-agnostic, single-pass, single-head protocol and report memory for all stored artifacts (importance matrices, teacher weights). Under this iso-budget view, they serve as reference points but are not competitive with rehearsal in the 20-sample-per-class regime that defines our Pareto analysis.",
