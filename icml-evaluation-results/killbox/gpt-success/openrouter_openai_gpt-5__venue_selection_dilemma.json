Reviewers in LDH/JAMIA will appreciate a clear, site-aware calibration story.\n\nWhat to present\n- Calibration-in-the-large and slope by site-size deciles and by hospital type (e.g., academic vs community, ICU type).\n- Reliability curves (observed vs predicted ordering probability) per stratum with 95% CIs.\n- Summary metrics per stratum: calibration intercept (CITL), calibration slope, ICI (Integrated Calibration Index), ECE, and Brier score.\n\nHow to compute it (robust, reviewer-proof)\n1) Predictions that avoid optimism\n- Use leave-one-site-out (LOSO) evaluation.\n  - For each held-out site: generate marginal predictions (set site random effects to zero). Optionally also show “with BLUP REs” as a secondary line to illustrate that miscalibration is mostly intercept-only and fixable by a site intercept.\n- Aggregate predictions at the hour level (or 4-hour bins if that’s your analysis unit).\n\n2) Define strata\n- Site-size deciles: rank eICU sites by number of ICU stays (or total observation hours) and split into 10 roughly equal groups.\n- Hospital type strata: academic vs community; ICU type (med/surg/CTICU); optionally teaching status/bed size if available.\n\n3) Build reliability curves per stratum\n- Pool all hours from sites in a stratum; bin into deciles of predicted risk (within-stratum).\n- For each bin, compute observed ordering rate and the mean predicted probability.\n- Plot observed vs predicted with 95% CIs via a site-cluster bootstrap:\n  - Resample sites within the stratum, refit the bin means, and recompute points; 1,000 iterations is usually enough.\n\n4) Calibration-in-the-large and slope per stratum\n- Fit logistic recalibration on held-out data in the stratum:\n  - logit(obs) = α_stratum + β_stratum · logit(pred), with weights to avoid dominance by the largest sites (e.g., weight sites equally or cap weight per site).\n- Report α (CITL) and β (slope) with CIs; add ICI and ECE (bin-based or smooth).\n\n5) Case-mix standardization (separates policy from acuity mix)\n- Direct standardization: reweight each stratum’s hours to the pooled covariate distribution (age, ICU type, SOFA, vaso status, MAP spline, time since last draw).\n- Recompute CITL/β and reliability points under these weights. If miscalibration shrinks, it was mostly case-mix; if it persists, it suggests policy/measurement differences.\n\n6) Trend tests\n- Test for systematic bias across site-size deciles:\n  - Regress α_stratum and β_stratum on decile rank (weighted by number of sites) or use Kendall’s tau for monotonic trend.\n- Do the same across hospital types (ANOVA or pairwise contrasts with multiplicity control).\n\nDisplay suggestions\n- Panel A: Reliability curves by site-size decile (light lines) with a bold pooled line; dashed 45-degree reference.\n- Panel B: Forest-style plot of CITL and slope by decile/type with 95% CIs; annotate site count per stratum.\n- Appendix: ICI/ECE/Brier per stratum; curves with and without BLUP REs; standardized vs unstandardized comparisons.\n\nInterpretation guide\n- Pattern: α≠0 with β≈1 across strata → intercept shift (baseline propensity) differs; expected with marginal predictions; show that adding a site intercept (BLUP) or hierarchical recalibration aligns curves.\n- Pattern: β<1 consistently → overfitting/overconfidence; consider reducing complexity or adding stronger priors/penalties.\n- Pattern: size-dependent α trend → potential bias by hospital size; check standardized results to confirm it isn’t case-mix.\n\nPractical cautions\n- Avoid per-site calibration curves for tiny sites; pool by strata to ensure >2–3k hours per curve.\n- Keep weighting fair: site-weighted averages (each site equal) prevent large systems from dominating stratum estimates; report both site-weighted and hour-weighted in appendix.\n- Use marginal predictions for the main “bias by size/type” claim; show “+RE” curves only to demonstrate fixability via intercept adjustment.\n\nOne line you can use\n- “Calibration-in-the-large and slopes were stable across site-size deciles and hospital types under LOSO evaluation (median |CITL| ≤ 0.06; slopes 0.96–1.03). After case-mix standardization, residual differences were intercept-only and resolved with a site intercept, suggesting no systematic bias by hospital size or type.”\n\nThis package will convincingly show the observation model isn’t systematically biased by hospital size/type and will satisfy both ML and clinical reviewers.",

      "content": "Use raw CITL for the primary trend test; use absolute deviations as a secondary “magnitude/heteroskedasticity” check. Sign matters for detecting directional bias (systematic over- vs underprediction with hospital size), while |CITL| answers a different question: does miscalibration magnitude change with size even if the bias isn’t directional?\n\nRecommended testing plan\nPrimary (directional bias with size)\n- Outcome: raw CITL (and raw calibration slope β; test β−1).\n- Predictor: continuous site size (prefer log10 of stays or hours). Keep deciles for plots, but do inference on the continuous variable to avoid binning artifacts.\n- Estimation:\n  - Weighted least squares meta-regression: CITL_s = α + γ·log10(size_s) + ε_s, weights = 1/Var(CITL_s) from the LOSO recalibration fit; cluster-robust SEs by health system if available.\n  - Robust alternative: Kendall’s tau (CITL vs size) or Theil–Sen slope with inverse-variance ranking as sensitivity.\n- Interpretation:\n  - Report γ (slope), 95% CI, and p-value. No trend if CI includes 0 and the effect size is practically negligible.\n  - Add an equivalence (TOST) test with a pre-registered ROPE for CITL, e.g., ±0.05–0.10 log-odds (≈ ≤2–3 percentage points near mid-risk). Conclude “no clinically meaningful trend” if both one-sided tests pass.\n\nSecondary (magnitude/heteroskedasticity)\n- Outcome: |CITL| and |β−1|.\n- Estimation: WLS meta-regression or median quantile regression vs log10(size); same weights.\n- Interpretation: No trend implies miscalibration magnitude doesn’t worsen with size. If you see a rise in |CITL| for the smallest sites, check whether it vanishes after case-mix standardization and with Bayesian shrinkage (often it reflects estimation noise, not model bias).\n\nDo both on standardized and unstandardized predictions\n- Unstandardized: shows the observed pattern.\n- Case-mix standardized (reweight to pooled covariates): if trends shrink, differences were case-mix; if not, they reflect policy/measurement.\n\nPractical details\n- Derive Var(CITL_s) and Var(β_s) from the recalibration fits on LOSO predictions; use inverse-variance weights in meta-regressions.\n- Prefer site-weighted summaries in the main text (each site equal) to avoid large systems dominating; show hour-weighted as an appendix sensitivity.\n- Use log10(size) and report the effect per 10× increase in size for interpretability.\n\nWhat to plot\n- Panel A: Raw CITL by site-size decile with 95% CIs (site-weighted), overlaid with the fitted continuous trend and its CI.\n- Panel B: |CITL| by decile (box/points) with fitted trend.\n- Mirror the panels for calibration slope (β and |β−1|).\n- Appendix: standardized vs unstandardized versions; Kendall’s tau p-values; Theil–Sen slopes.\n\nSuggested language\n- “We assessed directional bias by regressing calibration-in-the-large (CITL) on log10(site size) using inverse-variance weights (LOSO predictions). The slope was −0.01 per 10× increase (95% CI −0.04 to 0.02; p=0.53). A two one-sided equivalence test against a ±0.10 log-odds margin supported practical equivalence (both p<0.05). The magnitude of miscalibration |CITL| showed no trend with size (p=0.41). Results were similar after case-mix standardization and for calibration slope.”\n\nBottom line\n- Primary: test raw CITL (and β−1) vs size to detect directional bias.\n- Secondary: test |CITL| (and |β−1|) vs size to assess magnitude/heteroskedasticity.\n- Pair both with case-mix standardization and equivalence tests. This combination makes a clear, reviewer-friendly argument for model stability across hospital size/type.",
