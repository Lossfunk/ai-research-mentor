Excellent! Here's a **feasible beginning path** for ML for climate:

## 🎯 Start Here (Beginner-Friendly):

### 1. **Climate Change AI Tutorials** (Best Starting Point!)
- Website: https://www.climatechange.ai/tutorials
- **Why it's perfect**: Interactive Colab notebooks (no setup needed), hands-on projects like:
  - Forecasting El Niño events
  - Flood mapping with satellite data
  - Building energy forecasting
- You can start coding immediately in your browser!

### 2. **Free Learning Resources**:
- **CCAI Summer School 2024** - All lectures are free on YouTube
  - Search for "Climate Change AI Summer School 2024" playlist
  - Covers fundamentals + real applications
  
- **ClimateBench Tutorial Series** (6 parts, ~25 min each)
  - Link: https://comptools.climatematch.io/tutorials/W2D4_AIandClimateChange/
  - Teaches: decision trees, random forests, climate prediction
  - Very beginner-friendly with exercises

## 🛠️ Practical First Steps:

**Week 1-2**: Learn Python basics (if needed)
- Codecademy or Python.org tutorials

**Week 3-4**: Pick ONE Climate Change AI tutorial and complete it
- Start with something visual like "flood mapping" - it's motivating!

**Week 5+**: Build on that foundation with more tutorials

## 💡 Why This Works:
- **Domain-specific from day 1**: You learn ML *through* climate problems
- **Real datasets**: Work with actual climate data
- **Community**: Climate Change AI has an active community for questions
- **Low barrier**: Colab notebooks = no complicated setup

**Would you like me to help you pick a specific first project based on what aspect of climate interests you most** (weather prediction, renewable energy, disaster response, etc.)?
