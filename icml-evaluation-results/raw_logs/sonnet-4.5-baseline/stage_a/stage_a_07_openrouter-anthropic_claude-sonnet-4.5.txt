## ⚠️ **Responsible Research Practices:**

### **DO:**
✅ **Always cite sources** (even in personal projects)
✅ **Consider bias** in every dataset/model
✅ **Think about impact** before building
✅ **Use public datasets** (Kaggle, Hugging Face, Google Dataset Search)
✅ **Share learnings** (blog posts help others!)
✅ **Ask for feedback** (communities love helping students)
✅ **Respect privacy** (never scrape personal data)
✅ **Acknowledge limitations** (be honest about what doesn't work)

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Scrape data without permission**
❌ **Deploy AI without safety checks**
❌ **Ignore environmental costs** (track compute usage)
❌ **Claim expertise you don't have** (be a learner!)
❌ **Build surveillance tools** (face recognition for tracking, etc.)
❌ **Ignore bias** ("the model said it" isn't an excuse)
❌ **Use AI to cheat** (obviously!)
