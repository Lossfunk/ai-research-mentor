- **Established educators** (Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio)
- **Official documentation** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)
- **Non-profit organizations** (Partnership on AI, AI Now Institute)

### **⚠️ BE SKEPTICAL Of:**
- LinkedIn "AI gurus" with no credentials
- Medium posts without citations
- YouTube channels promising "master AI in 2 weeks"

## 🚫 **Red Flags: How to Spot Misinformation**

### **Warning Signs:**

❌ **"AI will take all jobs by 2025"** → Overhyped timeline
❌ **"This one weird trick..."** → Clickbait, no substance
❌ **No citations or code** → Can't verify claims
❌ **"AGI is here"** → We're not there yet
❌ **Selling courses/products heavily** → Commercial bias
❌ **Promises without evidence** → "100% accuracy" (impossible)
❌ **Ignores limitations** → Every method has tradeoffs
❌ **"Experts don't want you to know"** → Conspiracy thinking

### **Fact-Checking Strategies:**

✅ **Check author credentials** (Google them, find affiliations)
✅ **Look for peer review** (Published in conference/journal?)
✅ **
