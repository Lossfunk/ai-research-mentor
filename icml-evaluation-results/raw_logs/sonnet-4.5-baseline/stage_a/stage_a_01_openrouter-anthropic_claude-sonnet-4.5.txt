I'd be happy to help you get started with AI research! To give you the most relevant guidance, let me ask a few questions:

1. **What's your current background?**
   - Are you a student, professional, or self-learner?
   - Do you have programming experience? (Python, in particular?)
   - What's your math background? (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, etc.)

2. **What aspects of AI interest you most?**
   - Machine Learning/Deep Learning
   - Natural Language Processing (like ChatGPT)
   - Computer Vision (image/video analysis)
   - Robotics
   - AI Ethics and Safety
   - Something else?

3. **What are your goals?**
   - Academic research (PhD track)
   - Industry applications
   - Personal projects/learning
   - Career transition

That said, I can search for some general resources and current trends in AI research to help you get oriented. Would you like me to do that, or would you prefer to answer these questions first so I can provide more tailored advice?
