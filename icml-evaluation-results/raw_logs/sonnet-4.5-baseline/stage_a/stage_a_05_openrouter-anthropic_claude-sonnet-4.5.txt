## ⚡ **CRITICAL QUESTIONS FIRST:**

1. **What level?** (Undergrad, Masters, PhD?)
2. **Your background?** (Can you code? Know Python? Any ML experience?)
3. **Thesis requirements?** (Page count? Original research required? Or survey/implementation OK?)
4. **Resources?** (GPU access? Computing cluster? Or just your laptop?)

## 🎯 **FEASIBLE 1-MONTH THESIS TRACKS**

Based on 2024 trends, here are **actually doable** options:

### **OPTION 1: Benchmark Evaluation** ⭐ SAFEST
**Topic**: "Evaluating [X Model] on [Y Benchmark] for [Z Task]"

**Examples**:
- "Evaluating GPT-4o vs Claude on Medical Question Answering"
- "Benchmarking Vision Models on ImageNet-D (Synthetic Objects)"
- "Comparing LLMs on Fake News Detection"

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Datasets + code already exist
- ✅ Clear methodology (run experiments, analyze results)
- ✅ Contributions: Novel comparison, insights, recommendations
- ✅ 2-3 weeks execution + 1 week writing

**Your action**:
1. Pick domain (medical, vision, NLP, etc.)
2. Find recent benchmark (NeurIPS 2024 has many)
3. Run 3-5 models, compare results

### **OPTION 2: Fine-tuning Study** 💡 MODERATE
**Topic**: "Fine-tuning [Model] for [Specific Application]"

**Examples**:
- "Fine-tuning LLaMA for Customer Service in [Industry]"
- "Adapting CLIP for Medical Image Classification"
- "Fine-tuning Whisper for [Language] Speech Recognition"

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Pre-trained models available (Hugging Face)
- ✅ Datasets on Kaggle/Hugging Face
- ✅ Clear before/after comparison
- ✅ Practical contribution

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Literature review + setup
- Week 2-3: Fine-tuning experiments
- Week 4: Analysis + writing

---

### **OPTION 3: Survey + Small Experiment** 📚 LOWEST RISK
**Topic**: "A Survey of [Hot Topic] with Empirical Validation"

**Examples**:
- "Prompt Engineering Techniques for LLMs: A Survey with Experiments"
- "AI for Climate Change: A Review with Case Study"
- "Federated Learning for Privacy: Survey + Benchmark"

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Survey = literature review (you're doing this anyway)
- ✅ Small experiment validates understanding
- ✅ Acceptable for most thesis committees
- ✅ Low technical risk

**Timeline**:
- Week 1-2: Read 20-30 papers, organize
- Week 3: Run simple experiment/demo
- Week 4: Write + polish

---

### **OPTION 4: Application Project** 🚀 IF YOU CODE WELL
**Topic**: "Building [X] using [Y AI Technology]"

**Hot 2024 examples**:
- "No-Code Chatbot for Small Business Instagram DMs" (actual 2024 thesis!)
- "AI-Powered Medical Symptom Checker using GPT-4"
- "Fake News Detection Dashboard with BERT"

**Why it works**:
- ✅ Practical, impressive demo
- ✅ APIs make it faster (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face)
- ✅ Clear contribution

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Design + prototype
- Week 2-3: Build + test
- Week 4: Evaluation + writing
