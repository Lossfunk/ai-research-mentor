## 🚨 CRITICAL ETHICAL PITFALLS 🚨

### **This is NOT like other ML projects. You can cause serious harm.**

### **Major Ethical Risks:**

#### **1. Cultural Appropriation & Extractive Research**

**The Problem:**
- Indigenous communities have been exploited by researchers for centuries
- Taking language data without giving back
- "Helicopter research" - extract data, publish, leave
- Benefiting your career while communities get nothing

**Red Flags:**
- "I'll scrape indigenous language data and train a model"
- Publishing without community permission
- Not sharing tools/benefits with community
- Treating language as just "data"

**How to Avoid:**
- **Partnership, not extraction**: Work WITH communities, not ON them
- **Community consent**: Get explicit permission for data use
- **Benefit sharing**: Communities should gain from the research
- **Co-authorship**: Include community members as authors
- **Long-term commitment**: Not a one-off project

#### **2. Cultural Harm & Misrepresentation**

**The Problem:**
- Language carries sacred knowledge, cultural protocols
- Some knowledge is restricted (not for everyone, not for AI)
- Generative models might create culturally inappropriate content
- Could violate cultural protocols around who can speak/teach

**Examples of Harm:**
- Generating sacred texts that should only be spoken by elders
- Creating content that violates gender-based language protocols
- Mixing dialects in culturally inappropriate ways
- Teaching language without cultural context (language ≠ just words)

**How to Avoid:**
- **Cultural protocols**: Understand what can/cannot be shared
- **Restricted content**: Some knowledge should NOT be in the model
- **Cultural review**: Community members review outputs
- **Context preservation**: Language learning includes cultural education
- **Elder guidance**: Work with knowledge keepers

#### **3. Data Sovereignty & Ownership**

**The Problem:**
- Who owns the language data?
- Who controls the model?
- What happens to the data after the project?
- Can the model be commercialized?

**Key Principle: Indigenous Data Sovereignty**
- Indigenous communities have rights over their data
- CARE Principles: Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics
- OCAP® Principles: Ownership, Control, Access, Possession

**How to Avoid:**
- **Community ownership**: Data and models belong to community
- **Transparent agreements**: Clear data use agreements
- **No commercialization without consent**: Don't profit from indigenous languages
- **Right to withdraw**: Community can revoke access anytime
- **Local storage**: Consider keeping data in community control

#### **4. Replacing Human Teachers & Speakers**

**The Problem:**
- Language revitalization is about community relationships
- Elders and fluent speakers are irreplaceable
- AI could be seen as replacing human teachers
- Might reduce funding for human language programs

**How to Avoid:**
- **Position as supplement, not replacement**: AI assists, doesn't replace
- **Center human speakers**: Technology serves people, not vice versa
- **Support existing programs**: Don't compete with human teachers
- **Intergenerational connection**: Facilitate elder-youth interaction

#### **5. Perpetuating Colonial Power Dynamics**

**The Problem:**
- Outsider "saving" indigenous languages = colonial savior complex
- Imposing outside solutions without community input
- Prioritizing your research goals over community needs
- Reinforcing power imbalances

**How to Avoid:**
- **Community-led**: They define the problem and solution
- **Humility**: You're a guest and collaborator, not the expert
- **Listen more than you speak**: Understand community priorities
- **Decolonize methodology**: Question assumptions, power dynamics

#### **6. Data Quality & Endangerment**

**The Problem:**
- Many indigenous languages have very limited digital data
- Data might be low quality, inconsistent
- Speakers may be elderly, passing away
- Creating bad models could do more harm than good

**How to Avoid:**
- **Realistic about limitations**: Don't overpromise
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have small, good dataset
- **Document carefully**: Preserve context, metadata
- **Backup plans**: If not enough data, what else can you do?

#### **7. Unintended Consequences**

**The Problem:**
- AI-generated content might be seen as "authoritative"
- Could introduce errors that propagate
- Might create new dialects/variations
- Could affect language evolution in unforeseen ways

**How to Avoid:**
- **Clear labeling**: AI-generated content marked as such
- **Human verification**: All outputs reviewed by speakers
- **Monitoring**: Track how tools are used and impacts
- **Adaptive approach**: Be ready to change or stop
