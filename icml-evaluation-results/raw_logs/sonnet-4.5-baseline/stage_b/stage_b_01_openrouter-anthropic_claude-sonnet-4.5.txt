I apologize, but I'm unable to search the web at the moment due to technical issues. However, I can provide some insights based on my training data:

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for sea ice forecasting is a relatively emerging area, but not entirely novel.** Here's what I know:

## Current State (as of my last update):

**Existing work:**
- Machine learning approaches (including deep learning) have been increasingly applied to sea ice forecasting in recent years
- Traditional methods include CNNs, LSTMs, and other neural network architectures
- Graph-based approaches are gaining traction in climate/weather forecasting more broadly

**Why GNNs make sense for sea ice:**
- **Spatial relationships**: Sea ice dynamics involve complex spatial interactions that graphs can naturally represent
- **Irregular geometries**: GNNs can handle the irregular coastlines and varying grid structures better than CNNs
- **Physical processes**: Ice floe interactions, leads, and ridging have network-like properties

## Potential novelty angles:

Even if some work exists, you might find novel contributions in:
1. **Specific GNN architectures** tailored to sea ice physics
2. **Multi-scale temporal dynamics** (daily to seasonal predictions)
3. **Integration with physical models** (hybrid approaches)
4. **Specific regions or phenomena** (Arctic vs Antarctic, sea ice extent vs thickness vs concentration)
5. **Explainability** of GNN predictions for sea ice processes

## Recommendation:

I'd suggest conducting a thorough literature review through:
- Google Scholar, arXiv, and academic databases
- Recent climate/weather AI conferences (NeurIPS Climate, ICLR workshops, AGU)
- Journals like *The Cryosphere*, *Journal of Climate*, and AI venues

Would you like me to help you think through specific aspects of your approach or potential research questions?
