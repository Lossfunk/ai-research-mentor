- Building foundational knowledge

**Trust and adoption:**
- Students need to know when to trust the system
- Instructors need confidence in the tool
- Institutions need accountability

**Educational best practices:**
- Good tutoring admits uncertainty
- Encourages critical thinking
- Doesn't just give answers
- **Calibrated system aligns with pedagogy**

#### **3. Clear Stakeholders and Use Cases**

**Cons:**
- Limited by base model
- May not be optimal

#### **Option B: Fine-Tuned Calibrated Model**

**Approach:**
- Fine-tune LLM on educational data
- Train with calibration objectives
- Potentially smaller, more efficient model

**Pros:**
- Better calibration
- Can optimize for educational domain
- More control

**Cons:**
- Requires training data and compute
- More complex

#### **Option C: Ensemble + Calibration**

**Approach:**
- Multiple models or sampling strategies
- Aggregate predictions with uncertainty
- Calibrate ensemble outputs

**Pros:**
- Better uncertainty estimates
- More robust

**Cons:**
- Higher computational cost
- More complex

#### **Recommended: Start with A, explore B/C**

---

### **Phase 2: Uncertainty Presentation**

**How do you communicate confidence to students?**

#### **Option 1: Explicit Confidence Scores**
```
"I'm 85% confident this is correct."
```
**Pros:** Quantitative, precise
**Cons:** May not be interpretable, false precision

#### **Option 2: Verbal Uncertainty**
```
"I'm fairly confident..." vs. "I'm not sure..."
```
**Pros:** Natural, interpretable
**Cons:** Subjective, less precise

#### **Option 3: Selective Response**
```
High confidence: Give answer
Low confidence: "Let's work through this together" or "Ask your instructor"
```
**Pros:** Actionable, safe
**Cons:** Less information

#### **Option 4: Visual Indicators**
```
Color coding, icons, progress bars
```
**Pros:** Quick to parse
**Cons:** Needs user training

#### **Recommended: User testing to determine best approach**
- Likely combination of methods
- Different for different contexts
- A/B testing

---

### **Phase 3: Pedagogical Integration**

**Calibration as teaching tool:**

#### **Strategy 1: Socratic Tutoring**
```
Student: "What's the derivative of x²?"
System (high confidence): "Before I tell you, what do you think? 
What rule might apply here?"
```

#### **Strategy 2: Uncertainty as Learning Opportunity**
```
System (low confidence): "I'm not certain about this. 
Let's look it up together and learn. Here are some resources..."
```

#### **Strategy 3: Adaptive Scaffolding**
```
High confidence → Less scaffolding (student is ready)
Low confidence → More scaffolding (concept is difficult)
```

#### **Strategy 4: Metacognitive Prompts**
```
"How confident are you in your answer? Why?"
Model uncertainty as part of learning process
```
