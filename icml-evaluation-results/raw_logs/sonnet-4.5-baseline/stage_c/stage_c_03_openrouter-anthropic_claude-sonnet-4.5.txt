**Web search unavailable.** The following plan draws on established domain knowledge. For publication-grade rigor, you would need to conduct systematic literature reviews via PubMed, arXiv, and clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov) for recent AI-oncology papers, FDA-approved AI diagnostics, and ongoing AI-driven drug trials.

## Critical Reality Check

**"Curing cancer with AI tomorrow" is not scientifically feasible.** Cancer comprises >200 distinct diseases with heterogeneous biology, and clinical translation timelines span 5-15 years (discovery → Phase III → FDA approval). This plan reframes the goal to **maximize AI's impact on cancer outcomes within realistic constraints**, focusing on:

1. **Near-term (6-12 months):** Improve diagnosis, treatment selection, and patient stratification using existing data
2. **Medium-term (2-5 years):** Accelerate drug discovery and clinical trial optimization
3. **Long-term (5-15 years):** Enable novel therapeutic modalities (personalized vaccines, combination therapies)

The 6-month plan below targets **demonstrable progress** on high-impact, tractable problems where AI can compress timelines or improve outcomes measurably.

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Problem Statement:**  
Cancer remains the second leading cause of death globally (10M deaths/year). Key bottlenecks where AI can intervene:

1. **Late diagnosis:** 50-70% of cancers detected at advanced stages (lower survival)
2. **Treatment selection:** 30-40% of patients receive suboptimal therapy due to incomplete biomarker profiling
3. **Drug development:** 90% failure rate in oncology trials; 10-15 year timelines; $2B+ costs
4. **Resistance mechanisms:** Tumors evolve; 30-50% of patients develop resistance within 1 year
5. **Clinical trial inefficiency:** 80% of trials fail to meet enrollment targets; poor patient-trial matching

**Reframed Goal:**  
Develop and validate AI systems that demonstrably improve cancer outcomes across the care continuum, with measurable impact within 6 months on at least one of:
- **Early detection:** Increase stage I/II diagnosis rates by 10-20%
- **Treatment optimization:** Improve progression-free survival (PFS) by 15-25% via better patient-treatment matching
- **Drug discovery acceleration:** Identify 3-5 high-confidence therapeutic candidates for preclinical validation
- **Clinical trial efficiency:** Reduce patient recruitment time by 30-50%

**Primary Goals (6-month horizon):**
- Deploy AI diagnostic models achieving radiologist/pathologist-level performance (AUC >0.95) on 2-3 cancer types
- Build patient-treatment matching system predicting response to therapy with >70% accuracy
- Generate AI-designed drug candidates with predicted binding affinity <10nM for 2-3 validated oncology targets
- Create clinical trial matching engine improving enrollment rates by 30%

**Secondary Goals:**
- Establish data partnerships with 2-3 cancer centers for model validation
- Publish 2-3 papers in high-impact journals (Nature Medicine, Cell, Lancet Oncology)
- Secure regulatory pathway (FDA Breakthrough Device, EMA qualification)
- Open-source tools/models to accelerate community progress
