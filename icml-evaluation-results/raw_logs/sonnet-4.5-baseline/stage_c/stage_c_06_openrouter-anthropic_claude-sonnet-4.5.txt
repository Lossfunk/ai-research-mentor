The search yielded several directly relevant papers on FL in low-resource settings [1,2,3,4]. I'll construct a rigorous research plan addressing the unique constraints of developing countries: limited connectivity, heterogeneous devices, data scarcity, and infrastructure challenges.

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Problem Statement:**  
Federated Learning (FL) promises privacy-preserving collaborative model training without centralizing data—critical for sensitive applications (healthcare, finance) in low-resource countries. However, standard FL frameworks assume reliable infrastructure (stable internet, modern devices, consistent power) that doesn't exist in many developing regions. Key barriers include:

1. **Connectivity constraints:** Intermittent internet (2G/3G), high latency (500ms-2s), expensive data plans ($5-20/GB in Sub-Saharan Africa vs. $0.10-1/GB in developed countries)
2. **Device heterogeneity:** Wide range from feature phones to smartphones; 30-50% of devices have <2GB RAM, limited battery life
3. **Data scarcity & quality:** Small local datasets (10-100 samples per client), label noise, class imbalance
4. **Infrastructure gaps:** Unreliable power (4-12 hour daily outages in some regions), limited cloud access, lack of local compute
5. **Sociotechnical challenges:** Low digital literacy, regulatory uncertainty, lack of local expertise

Existing FL work [1,2,4] highlights these gaps but lacks comprehensive solutions validated in real-world low-resource deployments.

**Core Hypothesis:**  
FL systems tailored to low-resource constraints—through communication-efficient algorithms, asynchronous protocols, on-device compression, and hybrid edge-cloud architectures—can enable collaborative AI in developing countries with <10% performance degradation vs. ideal settings while reducing communication costs by 50-100×.

**Primary Goals (6-month horizon):**
- Deploy FL systems in 2-3 low-resource settings (healthcare, agriculture) across Africa/South Asia
- Achieve model accuracy within 5% of centralized training with 50-100× communication reduction
- Demonstrate feasibility: <$1/client/month data costs, <2-hour training on entry-level smartphones
- Publish deployment study documenting lessons learned, failure modes, and design principles

**Secondary Goals:**
- Open-source FL toolkit optimized for low-resource settings
- Establish partnerships with 3-5 local institutions (hospitals, NGOs, universities)
- Train 20-30 local practitioners in FL deployment and maintenance
- Influence policy: Provide evidence for data governance frameworks in partner countries

## 2. Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Communication-Efficient FL for Intermittent Connectivity**

**Hypothesis:** Gradient compression (quantization, sparsification) combined with asynchronous aggregation can reduce communication by 50-100× while maintaining accuracy within 2-3% of standard FL, enabling deployment over 2G/3G networks.

**Setup:**
- **Algorithms:**
  1. **Gradient compression:** Top-k sparsification (send top 1-10% gradients), 4-bit/8-bit quantization, SignSGD
  2. **Asynchronous FL:** Clients upload whenever connectivity available; server aggregates with staleness weighting
  3. **Federated Averaging variants:** FedProx (handle heterogeneity), FedNova (normalize updates)
  4. **Hybrid:** Combine compression + async + adaptive learning rates
- **Simulated environment:** Replay real network traces from low-resource regions
  - Network traces: Kenya (Safaricom 3G), India (rural Airtel), Nigeria (MTN)
  - Simulate: packet loss (5-20%), latency (500-2000ms), intermittent disconnections (30-60% uptime)
- **Tasks & datasets:**

- Asynchronous aggregation: Tolerates 50% client dropout with <3% accuracy degradation
- Combined approach: 100× communication reduction, 3-5% accuracy drop vs. centralized
- Identifies sweet spot: 5% sparsity + 8-bit quantization for best accuracy-communication trade-off

**Ablations:**
- Compression ratio: Top-k for k ∈ {1%, 5%, 10%, 20%}
- Quantization bits: {1, 4, 8, 16}
- Staleness handling: Immediate aggregation vs. weighted by age vs. discard old updates
- Client selection: Random vs. prioritize high-quality data vs. prioritize stable connections
