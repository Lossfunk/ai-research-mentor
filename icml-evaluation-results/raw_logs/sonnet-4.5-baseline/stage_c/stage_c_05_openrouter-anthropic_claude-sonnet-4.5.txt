## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Reality Assessment:**  
Not knowing Python is a significant but **not insurmountable** barrier to AI research. Multiple viable paths exist:

1. **Theoretical research:** Mathematics, proofs, algorithms (no coding required)
2. **No-code/low-code platforms:** GUI-based ML tools, AutoML systems
3. **Collaborative research:** Partner with implementation-focused researchers
4. **Learn minimal Python:** 2-3 months intensive study to reach research competency
5. **Alternative languages:** R, Julia, MATLAB (if you know these)

**Strategic Recommendation:**  
Pursue a **hybrid approach**: Start with no-code tools and theoretical work immediately (0-3 months) while learning Python in parallel (months 1-6). This maximizes productivity while building essential skills.

**Core Philosophy:**  
*Research contributions come from ideas, not just implementation.* Many high-impact papers (theoretical analysis, novel problem formulations, benchmark creation) require minimal or no coding.

**Primary Goals (6-month horizon):**
- Conduct 1-2 research projects using no-code tools or theoretical methods
- Achieve basic Python competency (read code, modify scripts, run experiments) by month 4
- Publish 1 workshop paper or preprint
- Build foundation for independent research by month 6

**Secondary Goals:**
- Identify research niche where coding barrier is minimal
- Establish collaborations to compensate for technical gaps
- Create reusable research artifacts (datasets, benchmarks, theoretical frameworks)
- Develop learning roadmap for long-term technical skill acquisition
