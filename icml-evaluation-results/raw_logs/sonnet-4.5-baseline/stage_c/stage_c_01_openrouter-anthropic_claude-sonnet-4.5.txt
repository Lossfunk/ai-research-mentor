The search results show general deep learning for sea ice and GNNs for weather/climate, but no direct GNN+sea ice work. This represents a clear research gap. I'll construct a rigorous plan based on established GNN spatiotemporal methods applied to the sea ice domain.

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Problem Statement:**  
Sea ice dynamics exhibit complex spatiotemporal dependencies driven by atmospheric forcing, ocean currents, and thermodynamic processes. Current operational forecasting relies on physics-based models (e.g., CICE, neXtSIM) that are computationally expensive and struggle with sub-seasonal accuracy, while existing deep learning approaches [1,2] use CNNs or U-Nets that treat spatial relationships uniformly and cannot naturally represent irregular ice edge geometries or variable connectivity between regions.

**Core Hypothesis:**  
Graph Neural Networks can improve sea ice concentration (SIC) and thickness (SIT) forecasting by:
1. Explicitly modeling non-local teleconnections (e.g., Arctic Oscillation impacts)
2. Adapting spatial message-passing to evolving ice edge topology
3. Reducing computational cost vs. physics simulators while maintaining interpretability

**Primary Goals:**
- Develop GNN architectures for 1-day to 6-month sea ice forecasting
- Achieve ≥5% reduction in RMSE vs. CNN baselines (IceNet [1]) for pan-Arctic SIC prediction
- Demonstrate computational speedup (>100×) vs. CICE ensemble runs
- Provide uncertainty quantification for operational use

**Secondary Goals:**
- Interpret learned graph structures to identify physical teleconnection patterns
- Extend to multi-modal inputs (SAR imagery, ice charts, atmospheric reanalysis)
- Test generalization from Arctic to Antarctic domains

## 2. Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Static Graph GNN Baseline**

**Hypothesis:** A GNN with fixed spatial graph structure (k-NN or radius-based connectivity) can match or exceed CNN performance for monthly SIC forecasting by capturing non-local dependencies.

**Setup:**
- **Architecture:** GraphSAGE or GCN with 4 message-passing layers, temporal encoding via positional embeddings
- **Graph construction:** Nodes = 25km EASE-2 grid cells; edges connect k=8 nearest neighbors or r=200km radius
- **Input features:** Monthly SIC, SIT, SST, SAT, wind vectors (u/v), ice drift from NSIDC
- **Forecast horizon:** 1, 3, 6 months ahead
- **Training:** 1979-2015 ERA5 + NSIDC passive microwave; validation 2016-2018; test 2019-2021

**Baselines:**
1. Persistence (previous month SIC)
2. Linear regression on climate indices (AO, NAO)
3. IceNet U-Net [1] (CNN with climate simulation pre-training)
4. LSTM with convolutional layers

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- RMSE, MAE for SIC (%)
- Binary accuracy for ice presence (SIC > 15%)
- Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE) [km]
- Sea Ice Extent (SIE) bias [10⁶ km²]
- Computational cost: training time, inference latency, FLOPs

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Static GNN matches CNN RMSE (±2%) for 1-month lead
- GNN shows advantage at 3-6 month leads where teleconnections matter (+3-5% RMSE improvement)
- 10-20× faster inference than LSTM due to parallelizable message-passing

### **Experiment 2: Dynamic Graph Construction**

**Hypothesis:** Learning adaptive edge weights or dynamic graph structures conditioned on ice state improves prediction, especially near the marginal ice zone (MIZ) where topology changes rapidly.

**Setup:**
- **Architecture:** Attention-based GNN (GAT or Transformer-style) with learned adjacency
  - Option A: Soft attention weights over k-NN graph
  - Option B: Gumbel-softmax graph rewiring at each layer
- **Comparison:** Static graph (Exp 1) vs. dynamic graph with same node features
- **Focus region:** Beaufort/Chukchi Seas (high variability MIZ)
- **Temporal resolution:** Daily forecasts (1-15 day lead) using AMSR2 daily SIC

**Baselines:**
- Static GNN from Exp 1
- ConvLSTM (captures local dynamics without explicit graph)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Same as Exp 1, plus:
- Edge sparsity and stability (% edges changed per timestep)
- Ablation: performance vs. attention budget (top-k edges)
- Qualitative: visualize learned connectivity during ice breakup events

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Dynamic graphs improve MIZ prediction by 5-10% RMSE over static
- Learned edges correlate with ocean current patterns (Beaufort Gyre) and atmospheric dipoles
- Trade-off: 2-3× higher training cost for marginal gains in ice interior

### **Experiment 3: Spatiotemporal GNN with Recurrent Dynamics**

**Hypothesis:** Combining message-passing spatial aggregation with recurrent temporal updates (GNN-RNN hybrid) captures ice memory effects (thickness-dependent melt lag) better than pure spatial or temporal models.

**Setup:**
- **Architecture:** 
  - Encoder: GNN (3 layers) → node embeddings
  - Temporal: GRU or Transformer applied to node time series
  - Decoder: MLP per node → SIC, SIT predictions
- **Multi-step rollout:** Autoregressive forecasting with teacher forcing schedule
- **Inputs:** Daily ERA5 (10m wind, 2m temp, radiation), SMOS SIT, NSIDC SIC
- **Forecast:** 15-day rollout with daily outputs

**Baselines:**
- GraphCast-style architecture [adapted from weather GNNs, refs 3,5,6]
- Separate GNN (spatial) + LSTM (temporal) pipeline
- Pure Transformer (treats grid as sequence)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Rollout stability: RMSE growth rate over 15 days
- Physics consistency: conservation of ice mass, SIE trend correlation
- Extreme event skill: POD/FAR for rapid ice loss events (>20% SIC drop in 3 days)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- GNN-GRU reduces error accumulation in rollouts vs. pure spatial models
- Hybrid model captures thickness-concentration coupling (thicker ice → slower melt)
- Identifies precursors to breakup events 5-7 days in advance

### **Experiment 4: Uncertainty Quantification via Ensemble GNNs**

**Hypothesis:** Probabilistic GNN ensembles (via dropout, deep ensembles, or variational inference) provide calibrated uncertainty estimates needed for operational decision-making.

**Setup:**
- **Methods:**
  1. MC Dropout (10 samples at inference)
  2. Deep ensemble (5 GNN models with different initializations)
  3. Evidential regression (outputs Dirichlet parameters)
- **Calibration:** Evaluate on held-out 2020-2021 test set
- **Use case:** Route planning for Arctic shipping (ice-free probability thresholds)

**Baselines:**
- Deterministic GNN + bootstrapped residuals
- IceNet probabilistic outputs [1]

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
- Reliability diagrams (calibration curves)
- Sharpness (ensemble spread)
- Coverage: % of observations within 90% prediction interval

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Deep ensembles best calibrated but 5× inference cost
- MC Dropout under-confident (too wide intervals)
- Evidential regression offers best speed/calibration trade-off

---

### **Experiment 5: Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation**

**Hypothesis:** A GNN pre-trained on Arctic data can be fine-tuned for Antarctic sea ice with limited data, and vice versa, despite different geography and dynamics.

**Setup:**
- **Pre-training:** Arctic 1979-2015 (37 years)
- **Target:** Antarctic with only 2010-2021 data (12 years)
- **Transfer methods:**
  1. Freeze encoder, fine-tune decoder
  2. Full fine-tuning with lower learning rate
  3. Domain-adversarial training (align Arctic/Antarctic embeddings)
- **Comparison:** Train from scratch on limited Antarctic data

**Baselines:**
- Ice-kNN-South [4] (Antarctic-specific ML model)
- No transfer (train on Antarctic only)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Few-shot performance: RMSE with 1, 3, 5 years Antarctic data
- Embedding similarity: CKA or SVCCA between Arctic/Antarctic node representations
- Feature importance shift: SHAP values for atmosphere vs. ocean drivers

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Transfer learning reduces Antarctic data requirement by 50-70%
- Shared representations: atmospheric forcing patterns generalize
- Domain-specific adaptation needed for ocean currents (ACC vs. Arctic gyres)

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-Up Directions

### **Immediate Extensions (within 12 months)**
1. **Multi-modal fusion:** Incorporate Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for high-resolution ice type classification (first-year vs. multi-year ice); use GNN to propagate SAR features across passive microwave grid
2. **Physics-informed losses:** Add conservation constraints (mass, energy) as soft penalties; test whether physics-guided training improves extrapolation to unseen climate regimes
3. **Hierarchical graphs:** Coarse global graph (500km nodes) + fine regional subgraphs (25km) with cross-scale message-passing, inspired by OneForecast [6]
4. **Causal discovery:** Use GNN attention weights + Granger causality to identify lead-lag relationships between
