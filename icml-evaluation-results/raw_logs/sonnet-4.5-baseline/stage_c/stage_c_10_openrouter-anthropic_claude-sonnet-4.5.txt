The searches yielded relevant sources on multimodal misinformation detection [1,2,3,4,5,6] and edge deployment approaches [7,8,9,10]. I'll construct a resource-constrained plan optimized for low-bandwidth deployment.

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Problem Statement:**  
Multimodal misinformation (image-text pairs, manipulated videos, out-of-context images) spreads rapidly in low-bandwidth regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, rural South Asia, Pacific islands) where:

1. **Infrastructure constraints:** 2G/3G networks (256kbps-2Mbps), expensive data ($5-15/GB), intermittent connectivity (30-60% uptime)
2. **Device limitations:** Entry-level smartphones (<2GB RAM), limited storage (<16GB), older Android versions
3. **Content characteristics:** WhatsApp/Facebook-native formats (compressed images, short videos), local languages (Swahili, Hindi, Tagalog), region-specific narratives
4. **Existing solutions fail:** Cloud-based fact-checkers (Snopes, AFP) require reliable internet; large vision-language models [1] (10-70B params) are infeasible on-device

Recent work demonstrates edge-based deployment [10] and synthetic data augmentation [3,5], but lacks comprehensive frameworks for extreme resource constraints in Global South contexts.

**Core Hypothesis:**  
Lightweight multimodal misinformation detectors (<100MB models, <500ms inference on entry-level devices) using knowledge distillation, efficient fusion architectures, and offline evidence retrieval can achieve >80% F1 score while operating in low-bandwidth environments with <10MB/day data usage.

**Primary Goals (6-month horizon):**
- Develop compressed multimodal models (<100MB) achieving >80% F1 on misinformation detection
- Deploy on Android devices (2GB RAM, Snapdragon 400-series) with <500ms latency
- Enable offline operation for 7+ days with pre-cached evidence database
- Field test with 100-200 users across 3 low-bandwidth regions (Kenya, rural India, Philippines)
- Open-source toolkit: mobile app + model zoo + evidence database

**Secondary Goals:**
- Multilingual support (English, Swahili, Hindi, Tagalog) with shared representations
- Explainability: Show users why content is flagged (visual + textual evidence)
- Community feedback loop: Crowdsource labels for continuous model improvement
- Data efficiency: <10MB/day bandwidth usage for evidence updates

## 2. Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Lightweight Multimodal Fusion Architecture**

**Hypothesis:** Knowledge distillation from large vision-language models [1] to efficient dual-encoder architectures (CLIP-based) with cross-modal attention can achieve >80% F1 on multimodal fact verification while reducing model size by 50-100× (from 5-10GB to <100MB).

**Setup:**
- **Teacher models:**
  - LVLM4FV [1] (large vision-language model for fact verification)
  - BLIP-2 (13B params, strong image-text understanding)
  - GPT-4V (via API for data labeling, not deployment)
- **Student architectures:**
  1. **Dual-encoder:** CLIP-ViT-B/32 (image) + DistilBERT (text) with cross-attention fusion (total: 150M params → quantize to 40-80MB)
  2. **Efficient transformer:** MobileBERT (text) + EfficientNet-Lite (image) with late fusion (80-100M params)
  3. **Graph-based [2]:** Evidence graph with lightweight GNN (30-50M params)
- **Distillation strategy:**
  - Soft targets from teacher (temperature=3-5)
  - Feature matching on intermediate layers
  - Multi-task: Misinformation classification + evidence retrieval + claim verification
- **Compression:**
  - Quantization: INT8 post-training quantization (PTQ) via TensorFlow Lite
  - Pruning: Structured pruning (remove 30-50% of attention heads)
  - Vocabulary reduction: 50k → 16k tokens for text encoder (focus on common words + domain-specific terms)
- **Datasets:**
  - **Primary:** MOCHEG (multimodal out-of-context, 12k image-text pairs) [similar to 4]
  - **Supplementary:** Fakeddit (1M Reddit posts, multi-class), COSMOS (160k fact-checked claims)
  - **Regional:** Collect 2k-5k WhatsApp/Facebook posts from Kenya, India, Philippines (partner with local fact-checkers)
  - **Synthetic augmentation [3,5]:** Generate 10k-20k synthetic misinformation examples using GPT-4V + DALL-E

**Baselines:**
1. Full-size LVLM4FV [1] (cloud-based, upper bound)
2. Text-only: DistilBERT on claim text
3. Image-only: EfficientNet on image
4. Simple concatenation: No cross-modal fusion
5. FakeZero [10] (67.6MB DistilBERT-Quant, text-only)

**Evaluation Metrics:**

2. **Efficiency:**
   - Model size (MB), parameters (M)
   - Inference latency (ms) on target devices (Samsung Galaxy A03, Tecno Spark 7)
   - Memory footprint (peak RAM during inference)
   - Energy consumption (mAh per 100 inferences)
3. **Robustness:**
   - Accuracy on out-of-distribution data (different regions, languages)
   - Performance on compressed images (WhatsApp compression, JPEG quality 60-80%)
   - Adversarial robustness (minor perturbations)
4. **Explainability:**
   - Attention visualization quality (do highlighted regions align with manipulations?)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Dual-encoder + distillation: 82-86% F1 (vs. 88-92% for teacher), 60-80MB quantized model
- Cross-attention fusion improves over late fusion by 4-7% F1
- Inference: 300-500ms on Snapdragon 600-series, 150-250ms on 700-series
- Synthetic data augmentation [3,5] improves F1 by 3-5% (especially for rare misinformation types)
- Identifies challenging cases: Subtle manipulations (face swaps, text overlay), culturally-specific narratives

**Ablations:**
- Distillation temperature: {2, 3, 5, 10}
- Fusion strategy: Early vs. intermediate vs. late fusion
- Quantization: FP32 vs. FP16 vs. INT8
- Vocabulary size: {8k, 16k, 32k, 50k}

  - **Total target:** 50-200MB evidence database (fits on device storage)
- **Retrieval architecture [2]:**
  - **Indexing:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) with IVF (inverted file index) + PQ (product quantization)

- **Update mechanism:**
  - Weekly evidence database updates (download 5-10MB delta when WiFi available)
  - Incremental indexing (add new claims without rebuilding entire index)
- **Graph-based evidence [2]:**
  - Construct evidence graph: nodes = claims/images, edges = semantic similarity
  - Graph neural network (GCN, 10-20M params) for evidence aggregation

**Baselines:**

- **Cultural adaptation:**
  - Region-specific misinformation themes (e.g., Kenya: election fraud, India: religious tensions, Philippines: disaster relief scams)
  - Local imagery: African/Asian faces, landmarks, clothing (avoid Western-centric bias)

**Baselines:**
1. English-only model (no multilingual support)
2. Language-specific models (train separate model per language)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- XLM-RoBERTa zero-shot: 68-75% F1 on Swahili/Tagalog (vs. 85% English)
- Few-shot (500 examples): 75-82% F1(closes 40-60% of zero-shot gap)

- Code-switching: 15-25% of real-world posts are mixed-language; performance drops 5-8%
- Cultural adaptation improves user trust (85% vs. 65% for generic explanations)

**Ablations:**
- Model architecture: mBERT vs. XLM-R vs. LaBSE
- Training data: English-only vs. multilingual vs. translate-train
