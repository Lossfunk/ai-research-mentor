Based on the search results, I can see there are multiple Hierarchical Transformer papers. To provide you with the most accurate guidance, could you please:

1. **Specify which Hierarchical Transformer paper** you're referring to? For example:
   - Document Level Hierarchical Transformer (ACL 2021)
   - Hierarchical Transformer for Scalable Graph Learning (IJCAI 2023)
   - Hierarchical Vision Transformer
   - Hierarchical Transformer for Task Oriented Dialog Systems (NAACL 2021)
   - Or another specific paper?

2. **Share the paper** by providing:
   - The paper title and authors
   - A link to the paper
   - Or attach/paste the paper content

Once you provide this information, I can give you a detailed breakdown of:

## What I'll Cover:

### **Key Components:**
- Data preprocessing steps (tokenization, segmentation, batching)
- Hierarchical block architecture (attention mechanisms, positional encodings)
- Model hyperparameters
- Training schedule (epochs, learning rate, warmup, optimization)
- Loss functions and training objectives

### **Comparability Requirements:**
- Exact dataset splits and versions
- Evaluation metrics and protocols
- Hyperparameter matching
- Random seed management
- Hardware/software environment specifications

### **Leakage Risks:**
- Pretraining/evaluation data overlap
- Information leakage through validation set
- Temporal data leakage
- Feature leakage in preprocessing
- Test set contamination risks

Please share the specific paper so I can provide targeted, accurate guidance!
