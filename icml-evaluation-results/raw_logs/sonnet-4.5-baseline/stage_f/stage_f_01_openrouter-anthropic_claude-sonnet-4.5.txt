   - **Format**: No strict page limit (typically 8-10 pages recommended)

### **Tier 2: Specialized & Fast-Track Options**

4. **EMNLP/ACL (NLP-focused)**

   - **Timeline**: ~2 month turnaround
   - **Fit**: Perfect for efficiency-focused work
   - **Format**: 4-8 pages

8. **JMLR (Journal of Machine Learning Research)**
   - **Timeline**: Rolling submissions, 3-6 month review
   - **Fit**: For mature, comprehensive work with strong theoretical/empirical results
   - **Ethics**: Author responsibility statement
   - **Format**: No page limit, LaTeX required

## **Simulated Reviewer Summary**

### **Paper**: *"Efficient Compression of Large Language Models via Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition"*

**Overall Recommendation**: **Weak Accept (6/10)**

---

**Reviewer #1 - ACCEPT (7/10)**

*Strengths:*
- Novel approach combining low-rank decomposition with adaptive rank selection
- Strong empirical results: 3.2x compression with <2% perplexity degradation on LLaMA-7B
- Comprehensive evaluation across 5 benchmarks (MMLU, HellaSwag, etc.)
- Clear presentation with good ablation studies

*Weaknesses:*
- Limited theoretical analysis of why adaptive selection outperforms fixed-rank methods
- Comparison missing against recent methods (e.g., GPTQ, AWQ from 2023)
- Computational cost of rank selection not thoroughly analyzed
- **Ethics concern**: No discussion of potential misuse of more accessible compressed models

*Questions:*
- How does method scale to 70B+ parameter models?
- Can you provide wall-clock inference time comparisons?

---

**Reviewer #2 - BORDERLINE (6/10)**

*Strengths:*
- Addresses important problem of LLM accessibility
- Reproducibility: Code and checkpoints promised to be released
- Well-structured paper with clear methodology

*Weaknesses:*
- **Incremental contribution**: Appears to be combination of existing techniques (SVD + learned threshold)
- Results not significantly better than LoRA compression baseline (Table 3)
- Missing analysis on generalization across different model architectures (only tested on LLaMA family)
- **Formatting issue**: Appendix figures referenced in main text but not clearly labeled
- **Ethics statement vague**: Mentions "dual use" but lacks concrete mitigation strategies

*Suggestions:*
- Strengthen novelty claims with theoretical justification
- Add GPT, Mistral, or other architecture families
- Expand ethics section per venue guidelines

---

**Reviewer #3 - WEAK ACCEPT (7/10)**

*Strengths:*
- Practical impact: Method achieves good speed/accuracy tradeoff
- Thorough ablation studies (Section 4.3)
- Good writing quality and clear figures
- Addresses reviewer concerns about energy efficiency

*Weaknesses:*
- Limited discussion of failure cases
- Would benefit from human evaluation on generation quality
- **Ethics**: Should discuss environmental impact more quantitatively (carbon footprint calculations)
- Some experimental details relegated to appendix when they should be in main text

*Minor Issues:*
- Table 2 formatting inconsistent with Table 1
- Citation formatting errors (lines 156, 203)

---

**Meta-Reviewer Summary:**

The paper presents a solid contribution to LLM compression with good empirical results. However, reviewers raised concerns about:
1. **Incremental novelty** - needs stronger differentiation from prior work
2. **Ethics compliance** - expand beyond boilerplate to venue-specific requirements
3. **Formatting** - address table/citation inconsistencies

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions. Authors should:
- Add missing baselines (GPTQ, AWQ)
- Strengthen ethics statement with concrete analysis
- Fix formatting issues
- Add broader architecture evaluation if possible

## **Strategic Recommendations for Your 6-Month Timeline:**

1. **Month 1-3**: Target ICLR (if starting in June/July) or ICML (if starting in August)
2. **Month 4-5**: Prepare backup submission to EMNLP or MLSys
3. **Month 6**: Consider workshop venues as quick publication option

**Ethics Checklist for Submission:**
- ✅ Broader impact statement (2-3 paragraphs)
- ✅ Discuss democratization vs. misuse tradeoff
- ✅ Environmental impact (energy consumption analysis)
- ✅ Bias propagation in compressed models
- ✅ Reproducibility statement with code/data release plan
- ✅ Limitations section

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific venue or provide more detailed reviewer response strategies?
