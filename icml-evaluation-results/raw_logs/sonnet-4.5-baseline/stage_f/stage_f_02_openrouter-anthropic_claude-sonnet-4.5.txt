Here's a comprehensive checklist to self-audit:**

### **🔴 CRITICAL COMPLIANCE RISKS**

#### **1. Dataset Licensing Issues**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Using CommonCrawl/C4 data without acknowledging license restrictions
- ❌ Evaluating on datasets with non-commercial licenses (e.g., some ImageNet variants) without stating limitations
- ❌ Training on scraped web data without discussing consent/copyright issues
- ❌ Using models trained on restricted data (e.g., LLaMA 1 for commercial use)

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Add to paper (Dataset section):
"All datasets used comply with their respective licenses:
- [Dataset A]: Licensed under [CC-BY-4.0/MIT/Apache 2.0]
- [Dataset B]: Used for research purposes only per [license terms]
- We acknowledge that [Dataset C] contains web-scraped data with 
  potential copyright considerations (see Ethics Statement)"

✅ Create License Table:
| Dataset | License | Commercial Use | Attribution Required |
|---------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| MMLU    | MIT     | ✓             | Yes                 |
| C4      | ODC-BY  | ✓             | Yes                 |
```

#### **2. Base Model Licensing**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Compressing LLaMA v1 without Meta's approval
- ❌ Using GPT-3.5/4 outputs to train models (violates OpenAI ToS)
- ❌ Not disclosing model provenance

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Add to Methods section:
"Base Model: LLaMA-2-7B (Meta, 2023)
License: LLaMA 2 Community License Agreement
Usage: Compliant for research and commercial use
Source: Downloaded from HuggingFace (meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf)
Checksum: [hash] (for reproducibility)"

✅ If using proprietary models:
"We compress publicly available models only. For GPT-3.5 experiments,
we evaluate compression via API access (OpenAI ToS compliant) without
redistributing model weights."
```

---

#### **3. Human Subject Data**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Human evaluation without IRB approval/exemption
- ❌ Collecting human annotations without consent forms
- ❌ Not anonymizing human-generated data
- ❌ Using crowdworkers without fair compensation disclosure

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ If you did human evaluation:
"Human Evaluation Protocol:
- IRB Status: [Approved under protocol #XXX / Exempt per 45 CFR 46.104]
- Participants: N=50 recruited via [Prolific/MTurk]
- Compensation: $15/hour (above platform minimum wage)
- Consent: Informed consent obtained (see Appendix X)
- Data: All responses anonymized; no PII collected
- Demographics: [Age range, gender distribution] (optional but recommended)"

✅ If using existing human-annotated data:
"We use human annotations from [Dataset], which obtained informed
consent per their protocol (Citation). We do not collect new human data."
```

---

#### **4. Compute Disclosure**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Not reporting carbon footprint (required by NeurIPS, ICML)
- ❌ Missing GPU hours/cost estimates
- ❌ No reproducibility information

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Add to Experiments section:
"Computational Resources:
- Hardware: 8× NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPUs
- Total Compute: ~240 GPU-hours for all experiments
- Carbon Footprint: Estimated 12 kg CO₂eq using 
  [ML CO2 Impact calculator] (Lacoste et al., 2019)
- Location: [Cloud provider/institution], [region] grid
- Cost: Approximately $480 in compute resources"

✅ Use this calculator: https://mlco2.github.io/impact/
```

---

### **🟡 MODERATE RISKS**

#### **5. Bias & Fairness**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Not testing compressed models for bias amplification
- ❌ Ignoring demographic performance disparities

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Add to Ethics Statement:
"Bias Analysis:
We evaluate our compressed models on [BOLD/BBQ/WinoBias] to assess
whether compression amplifies social biases present in base models.
Results (Appendix X) show [minimal/moderate] bias shift.
Limitation: Our analysis covers [race, gender] but not [religion, 
disability]. Future work should expand bias evaluation."
```

---

#### **6. Dual-Use Concerns**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Generic "models can be misused" statement
- ❌ Not addressing compression making harmful models more accessible

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Replace vague statements with specific analysis:
"Dual-Use Considerations:
- Democratization: Compression enables broader access to LLMs for
  resource-constrained researchers, promoting equity.
- Misuse Risk: Compressed models could facilitate deployment of 
  harmful applications (misinformation, surveillance) on edge devices.
- Mitigation: We release compressed weights under same license as 
  base model (LLaMA 2 Acceptable Use Policy). We do not compress
  models known to be fine-tuned for harmful purposes.
- Recommendation: Downstream users should implement content filtering
  and usage monitoring per their jurisdiction."
```

---

#### **7. Environmental Impact**

**Common Violations:**
- ❌ Claiming "green AI" without lifecycle analysis
- ❌ Ignoring training cost vs. inference savings tradeoff

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Add nuanced discussion:
"Environmental Impact:
- Training Overhead: Our compression method requires 240 GPU-hours
  (12 kg CO₂eq), a one-time cost.
- Inference Savings: Compressed model reduces inference energy by
  3.2× per query. Break-even point: ~10M queries.
- Net Impact: For deployed models serving >10M queries, our method
  provides net carbon reduction. For small-scale use, overhead may
  outweigh benefits.
- Limitation: Analysis assumes [grid carbon intensity]. Actual impact
  varies by deployment location."
```

### **🟢 FORMATTING & DISCLOSURE**

#### **8. Required Sections (Venue-Specific)**

**NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR Checklist:**
```
✅ Ethics Statement (separate section or appendix)
✅ Reproducibility Statement:
   - Code availability: "Code will be released at [GitHub URL] upon acceptance"
   - Data availability: "All datasets publicly available (see Table X)"
   - Hyperparameters: "Full configuration in Appendix Y"
   - Random seeds: "All experiments run with seeds [1,2,3,4,5]"

   - "Results may not generalize to encoder-decoder architectures"
   - "We do not evaluate on non-English languages"
✅ Author Contributions (if required)
✅ Funding Disclosure: "Supported by [NSF Grant XXX / Google Research Award]"
✅ Conflicts of Interest: "Author X is employed by [Company Y]"
```

---

#### **9. Data/Code Availability**

**Common Violations:**

- ❌ Promising code release without timeline

**Required Fixes:**
```
✅ Concrete commitments:
"Reproducibility:
- Code: Apache 2.0 licensed, released at [github.com/user/repo]
- Compressed Models: Hosted on HuggingFace [huggingface.co/user/model]
- Data: Evaluation scripts and preprocessed data at [zenodo.org/XXX]

```

### **🔧 QUICK FIXES TEMPLATE**

Add this to your paper if missing:

```latex
\section*{Ethics Statement}

\textbf{Dataset Compliance:} All datasets used (Table~\ref{tab:datasets}) 
are publicly available and used in accordance with their licenses.

\textbf{Compute Resources:} Experiments used [X] GPU-hours, resulting in 
approximately [Y] kg CO₂eq emissions (ML CO2 Impact calculator).

\textbf{Broader Impact:} While model compression democratizes access to 
LLMs, it may also lower barriers for malicious use. We release models 
under restrictive licenses and recommend downstream safety measures.

\textbf{Limitations:} Our evaluation is limited to [specific architectures/
languages/tasks]. Compressed models may exhibit degraded performance on 
out-of-distribution inputs.

\textbf{Reproducibility:} Code, data, and model weights will be publicly 
released under [license] at [URL].
