### **SECTION 2: ETHICS & COMPLIANCE RISKS**

#### **🚨 CRITICAL: Medical/Sensitive Data Issues** (if applicable)

**If using medical imaging (histopathology, radiology, etc.):**

- [ ] **IRB Approval/Exemption**:
  ```
  ✅ Add to paper:
  "Data Use Compliance: All medical datasets used are publicly available
  and de-identified per HIPAA standards. Our institutional IRB confirmed
  exemption status (Protocol #XXX) for analysis of public datasets."
  ```

- [ ] **Dataset Licenses**:
  | Dataset | License | Commercial Use | Patient Consent | De-identification |
  |---------|---------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
  | Camelyon16 | Academic use | ❌ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | TCGA | dbGaP controlled | ❌ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | MNIST-Bags | Public domain | ✓ | N/A | N/A |

- [ ] **HIPAA Compliance Statement**:
  ```
  "All medical image datasets contain only de-identified data with no
  protected health information (PHI). We do not link imaging data to
  patient outcomes beyond what is provided in original datasets."
  ```

**If using other domains (e.g., text, natural images):**

- [ ] **Dataset Provenance Table**:
  ```latex
  \begin{table}
  \caption{Datasets used for transfer learning experiments}
  \begin{tabular}{lllll}
  Dataset & Domain & License & Size & Source \\
  \hline
  MNIST-Bags & Digits & CC0 & 10K bags & [Citation] \\
  Tiger & Animals & Academic & 1.2K bags & [Citation] \\
  Elephant & Animals & Academic & 1.4K bags & [Citation] \\
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
  ```

#### **⚠️ Common MIL Dataset License Issues**

**HIGH RISK DATASETS** (verify before using):
- ❌ **Camelyon16/17**: Academic use only, no commercial
- ❌ **TCGA**: Requires dbGaP authorization for genomic data
- ❌ **Private hospital datasets**: Cannot use without data use agreements
- ✅ **MNIST-Bags**: Public domain (safe)
- ✅ **CIFAR-10 (converted to MIL)**: MIT license (safe)
- ⚠️ **ImageNet-based MIL**: Check if using ImageNet21K (restricted)

**REQUIRED FIX**:
```latex
\section*{Data Availability and Ethics}

\textbf{Public Datasets:} We use the following publicly available datasets:
[List with citations and license types]

\textbf{License Compliance:} All experiments comply with dataset licenses.
Medical datasets (Camelyon16, TCGA) are used for academic research only
and are not redistributed. Results on these datasets are reported for
scientific reproducibility.

\textbf{Ethical Considerations:} Medical imaging datasets contain de-identified
patient data collected under informed consent (per original studies). Our
transfer learning approach does not introduce new privacy risks beyond
original data collection.
```

#### **🔒 Privacy & Fairness Risks**

- [ ] **Membership Inference Attack Vulnerability**:
  ```
  ⚠️ RISK: Transfer learning can leak information about source domain
  
  ✅ ADD TO LIMITATIONS:
  "Privacy Considerations: While we use only de-identified public datasets,
  transfer learning models may encode source domain characteristics. We
  recommend differential privacy techniques for sensitive applications."
  ```

- [ ] **Bias Propagation Analysis**:
  ```
  ❓ QUESTION: Do biases in source domain amplify in target domain?
  
  ✅ ADD EXPERIMENT:
  - Test on demographically stratified subsets (if available)
  - Report performance disparities across subgroups
  - Example: "We evaluate transfer performance across tumor grades
    (I/II/III/IV) to ensure no systematic bias toward common grades."
  ```

- [ ] **Fairness Metrics** (if applicable):
  - [ ] Equal opportunity difference
  - [ ] Demographic parity
  - [ ] Equalized odds

### **SECTION 5: MISSING ITEMS & RISKS**

#### **🔴 HIGH-PRIORITY MISSING ITEMS** (Must have before submission)

1. **❓ Negative Transfer Analysis**
   - **Risk**: Reviewers will ask "When does transfer hurt?"
   - **Fix**: Add experiment showing cases where transfer < training from scratch
   - **Timeline**: 3-5 days (run experiments + analysis)

2. **❓ Domain Similarity Metrics**
   - **Risk**: "How do you know which sources transfer best?"
   - **Fix**: Compute A-distance, MMD, or proxy metrics between domains
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 days

3. **❓ Few-Shot Transfer Results**
   - **Risk**: "Does transfer help with limited target data?"
   - **Fix**: Evaluate with 1%, 5%, 10%, 100% of target training data
   - **Timeline**: 2-4 days

4. **❓ Theoretical Justification**
   - **Risk**: "Why should MIL models transfer differently than standard models?"
   - **Fix**: Add analysis of bag-level vs. instance-level feature transferability
   - **Timeline**: 1 week (literature
