# **SIMULATED REVIEWER SUMMARY: Federated Learning Benchmark Paper**
## **Rebuttal-Style Review with Strengths, Concerns, and Missing Artifacts**

---

## **📋 META-REVIEWER SUMMARY**

**Paper Title**: [Federated Learning Benchmark Paper]  
**Recommendation**: **Borderline Accept (5.5/10)** - Conditional on addressing artifact and experimental concerns  
**Confidence**: High (4/5)

**Summary**: This paper presents a benchmark for federated learning systems with comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and FL algorithms. While the empirical work is extensive and the benchmark could be valuable to the community, reviewers raised significant concerns about missing baselines, incomplete artifact documentation, and lack of statistical rigor. The paper is on the borderline; acceptance depends on addressing artifact requirements and experimental gaps in the rebuttal.

**Consensus Issues Requiring Response**:
1. Missing comparisons to recent FL benchmarks (FedML, Flower)
2. Incomplete code/data release plan
3. Statistical significance testing absent
4. Privacy analysis superficial
5. Heterogeneity simulation methodology unclear

## **👤 REVIEWER #1: WEAK REJECT (5/10)**

**Expertise**: Federated Learning, Distributed Systems  
**Confidence**: Very High (5/5)

### **Summary**
This paper introduces a federated learning benchmark evaluating X algorithms across Y datasets. While the scope is ambitious and the evaluation is comprehensive, I have concerns about the experimental methodology, missing baselines, and artifact completeness. The paper could be valuable but needs significant revisions.

### **❌ WEAKNESSES**

**W1: Missing Critical Baselines [MAJOR]**
The paper does not compare against recent FL benchmarks:
- **FedML** (He et al., 2020): Widely-used FL benchmark with similar scope
- **Flower** (Beutel et al., 2020): Popular FL framework with benchmarking capabilities
- **LEAF** (Caldas et al., 2018): Standard benchmark for federated datasets
- **TFF** (TensorFlow Federated): Industry-standard FL framework

**Without these comparisons, it's unclear what novel insights this benchmark provides beyond existing work.**

**Question for authors**: How does your benchmark differ from/improve upon FedML and Flower? What unique value does it provide?

**W2: Incomplete Artifact Documentation [MAJOR]**
The code availability statement (Section 7) is vague:
- "Code will be released upon acceptance" - no anonymous repository for review
- No documentation of:
  - Installation instructions
  - Reproduction steps
  - Expected runtime
  - Hardware requirements
  - API documentation
- No evidence that code is production-ready or well-documented

**This violates the conference's artifact expectations.** Reviewers cannot verify reproducibility.

**Required for acceptance**:
- [ ] Anonymous code repository (GitHub/Anonymous4OpenScience)
- [ ] Complete README with setup instructions
- [ ] Scripts to reproduce all experiments
- [ ] Expected outputs and checksums
- [ ] Docker container for environment isolation

**W3: Statistical Significance Testing Absent [MAJOR]**
All results reported as single numbers without:
- Standard deviations across multiple runs
- Confidence intervals
- Statistical significance tests (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Number of random seeds used

**Example**: Table 2 shows FedAvg achieves 73.2% accuracy vs. FedProx 74.1%. Is this difference statistically significant? How many runs? What's the variance?

**This is a critical flaw for a benchmark paper.** Without statistical rigor, we cannot trust the conclusions.

**Required for acceptance**:
- [ ] Report mean ± std for all results (minimum 3 runs, preferably 5)
- [ ] Statistical significance tests for claimed improvements
- [ ] Discussion of variance sources (data splits, initialization, client sampling)

**W4: Privacy Analysis Superficial [MODERATE]**
Section 5.3 discusses privacy but lacks depth:
- No formal privacy guarantees (differential privacy, secure aggregation)
- No evaluation of privacy attacks (membership inference, model inversion, gradient leakage)
- No privacy-utility tradeoff analysis
- Claims about "privacy-preserving" without formal definitions

**For a benchmark paper, privacy evaluation should be systematic:**
- Implement standard privacy attacks (Zhu et al., 2019 gradient leakage)
- Evaluate defense mechanisms (gradient clipping, noise addition)
- Measure privacy-utility tradeoffs

**Question**: Do you plan to add privacy attack evaluation? This would significantly strengthen the paper.

**W5: Heterogeneity Simulation Methodology Unclear [MODERATE]**
Section 3.2 describes heterogeneity simulation but lacks critical details:
- How exactly is "feature heterogeneity" simulated? (Line 234-236 too vague)
- What is the mathematical formulation of the proposed sampling method?
- How do you ensure consistency across different datasets?
- How does your method compare to standard Dirichlet sampling?

**The paper claims this is a novel contribution, but without clear methodology, it's not reproducible.**

**Required**: 
- [ ] Mathematical formulation (equations, not just prose)
- [ ] Pseudocode for sampling algorithm
- [ ] Ablation comparing to standard methods
- [ ] Validation that simulated heterogeneity matches real-world distributions

**W6: Limited Analysis of Convergence Behavior [MINOR]**
- Convergence plots (Figure 4) only show 100 rounds - what happens longer term?
- No analysis of oscillation/divergence patterns
- No discussion of early stopping criteria
- Missing analysis of communication efficiency vs. final accuracy tradeoffs

**W7: Dataset Selection Rationale Weak [MINOR]**
- Why these 6 datasets specifically?
- Missing common FL benchmarks (EMNIST, CelebA, Reddit)
- No cross-silo scenarios (only cross-device)
- No evaluation on large-scale datasets (>1M samples)

## **👤 REVIEWER #2: BORDERLINE ACCEPT (6/10)**

**Expertise**: Machine Learning, Distributed Systems  
**Confidence**: High (4/5)

### **Summary**
This benchmark paper provides a useful evaluation of federated learning algorithms. The scope is comprehensive and the systems perspective (including wall-clock time, memory usage) is valuable. However, I share Reviewer #1's concerns about missing artifacts and statistical testing. I'm slightly more positive about the contribution but agree that artifact requirements must be met for acceptance.

---

### **✅ STRENGTHS**

**S1: Systems-Oriented Evaluation (Novel)**
Unlike prior FL benchmarks that focus only on accuracy, this paper evaluates:
- Wall-clock training time (Table 3)
- Memory consumption (Figure 6)
- Network bandwidth usage (Figure 7)
- Energy consumption on mobile devices (Section 5.4)

**This is a valuable contribution** that helps practitioners understand real-world deployment tradeoffs.

**S2: Heterogeneous Hardware Evaluation**
Section 5.4 evaluates FL on diverse hardware:
- Raspberry Pi (edge devices)
- Android phones (mobile)
- Cloud GPUs (servers)

This is more realistic than prior work that assumes homogeneous infrastructure.

**S3: Thorough Ablation Studies**
- Ablation on client sampling strategies (Section 5.5)
- Ablation on aggregation frequency (Section 5.6)
- Ablation on local epochs (Section 5.7)

These provide actionable insights for FL system designers.

**S4: Open Science Commitment**
Authors commit to releasing code, data, and models. If followed through, this could be a valuable community resource.

### **❌ WEAKNESSES**

**W1: Artifact Release Plan Too Vague [MAJOR]**
Section 7 states: "We will release all code and data upon acceptance."

**This is insufficient for a benchmark paper.** Reviewers need to verify:
- Code quality and documentation
- Reproducibility of results
- Ease of use for community

**Required**:
- [ ] Anonymous repository NOW (not after acceptance)
- [ ] Detailed README with reproduction instructions
- [ ] Estimated compute requirements (GPU hours, cost)
- [ ] License specification (MIT/Apache recommended)
- [ ] Maintenance plan (will you accept PRs? Fix bugs?)

**Suggested approach**: Use Anonymous GitHub (https://anonymous.4open.science/) to share code during review without deanonymizing.

**W2: Statistical Rigor Lacking [MAJOR]**
I agree with Reviewer #1 - no error bars, confidence intervals, or significance tests.

**Specific issues**:
- Table 2: FedAvg (73.2%) vs. FedProx (74.1%) - is 0.9% significant?
- Figure 4: Convergence curves show single runs - what about variance?
- Section 5.3: Claims about "faster convergence" without statistical backing

**Minimum requirement**: Report mean ± std over 3 runs with different
