## **📋 SECTION 1: DOUBLE-BLIND ANONYMIZATION CHECKLIST**

### **🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (Instant Rejection Risk)**

#### **1.1 Author Identity Leaks**

**❌ PROHIBITED:**
```latex
% DO NOT WRITE:
"We conducted a study at Stanford University..."
"Our team at Google Research developed..."
"Building on our previous work [Smith et al., 2023]..."
"We collected data using our internal annotation platform..."
"Participants were recruited from our institution..."
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```latex
% WRITE INSTEAD:
"We conducted a study at a large research university..."
"Researchers at a technology company developed..."
"Building on prior work [23]..." (cite normally, don't say "our")
"We collected data using a custom annotation platform..."
"Participants were recruited from a university community..."
```

#### **1.2 Self-Citation Anonymization**

**Strategy Matrix:**

| Your Citation | Anonymization Strategy | Example |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Recent unpublished work** | Omit or cite as "Anonymous" | [Anonymous, 2024] or "Concurrent work investigates..." |
| **Published work (>1 year)** | Cite normally, third person | "Prior work [15] showed..." (not "Our prior work") |
| **Published work (recent)** | Cite normally but avoid clustering | Distribute among other citations |
| **ArXiv preprints** | Avoid if possible | Wait to post until after review |
| **Workshop papers** | Cite normally | Treat as any other citation |

**Example Rewrites:**
```latex
% ORIGINAL (reveals identity):
In our previous study [Smith et al., 2023], we found that users 
prefer interface A. We now extend this work to interface B.

% ANONYMIZED VERSION 1 (if citation necessary):
Prior research [23] found that users prefer interface A. We extend 
this line of work to interface B.

% ANONYMIZED VERSION 2 (if very recent/identifying):
Recent work has shown user preferences for interface A [citation 
omitted for anonymity]. We extend this investigation to interface B.

% ANONYMIZED VERSION 3 (if unpublished):
Concurrent work investigates interface A [Anonymous, 2024]. We 
focus on interface B and provide comparative analysis.
```

#### **1.3 Institutional References**

**Common Leaks:**

| ❌ Identifying | ✅ Anonymous | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| "Stanford IRB Protocol #12345" | "University IRB Protocol [redacted]" | Remove protocol numbers |
| "MIT CSAIL participants" | "Computer science students" | Remove department names |
| "Recruited via [University] mailing list" | "Recruited via university mailing list" | Lowercase, generic |
| "Amazon Mechanical Turk" | "A crowdsourcing platform" | First mention only, then "MTurk" OK |
| "Prolific Academic" | "An online participant recruitment platform" | Generic description |
| "Google Forms" | "An online survey platform" | Generic unless critical to method |
| "Zoom interviews" | "Video conferencing software" | Generic |

**IRB Anonymization Template:**
```latex
% ORIGINAL:
This study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional 
Review Board (Protocol #45123). Participants were recruited through 
the Stanford Psychology Department subject pool.

% ANONYMIZED:
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at [a large 
research university] (Protocol #[redacted]). Participants were 
recruited through a university psychology subject pool.

% ALTERNATIVE (more generic):
This study received ethical approval from an institutional review 
board. Participants were recruited from a university participant pool 
with informed consent.
```

---

### **🟡 MODERATE RISKS (Reviewer May Request Changes)**

#### **2.1 Dataset & Tool Anonymization**

**If You Created/Collected the Dataset:**

| Scenario | Anonymization Strategy |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Publicly released dataset** | Cite normally, don't claim ownership: "We use the XYZ dataset [15]" |
| **Soon-to-be-released dataset** | "We introduce a new dataset (details in Appendix)" + anonymous repo |
| **Internal/proprietary dataset** | "We collected a dataset of [description]" (no name/affiliation) |
| **Institutional dataset** | "A dataset from [type of institution]" |

**Example:**
```latex
% If you created "Stanford Dialogue Dataset":

% ❌ WRONG:
We introduce the Stanford Dialogue Dataset, available at 
stanford.edu/datasets/dialogue

% ✅ CORRECT:
We introduce a new dialogue dataset collected at a research university 
(anonymized for review). The dataset will be publicly released upon 
acceptance at [anonymous repository URL].

% In supplementary material:
Dataset available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dialogue-XXXX
```

**Tool/Interface Anonymization:**

```latex
% ❌ IDENTIFYING:
We developed the "Stanford AI Evaluator" tool, shown in Figure 1.
[Screenshot shows "Stanford AI Evaluator" in title bar]

% ✅ ANONYMIZED:
We developed a custom evaluation interface, shown in Figure 1.
[Screenshot edited to show "AI Evaluation Interface" or blurred]

% Alternative:
We developed an evaluation tool (anonymized for review), shown in Figure 1.
```

#### **2.2 Participant Recruitment & Demographics**

**Recruitment Anonymization:**

```latex
% ❌ TOO SPECIFIC:
We recruited 50 participants (25 female, 25 male, ages 18-65) from 
the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus via flyers posted in 
the Computer Science building. Participants were compensated $15/hour, 
following University of Michigan compensation guidelines.

% ✅ ANONYMIZED:
We recruited 50 participants (25 female, 25 male, ages 18-65) from 
a large public university via campus flyers. Participants were 
compensated $15/hour, following institutional guidelines.

% ✅ BETTER (if compensation rate is identifying):
We recruited 50 participants (25 female, 25 male, ages 18-65) from 
a large public university. Participants were compensated at rates 
compliant with institutional and ethical guidelines.
```

**Demographics Table Anonymization:**

```latex
\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Participant demographics (N=50)}
\label{tab:demographics}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
Characteristic & Count \\
\midrule
\textbf{Gender} & \\
\quad Female & 25 \\
\quad Male & 25 \\
\quad Non-binary & 0 \\
\textbf{Age Range} & \\
\quad 18-25 & 35 \\
\quad 26-40 & 12 \\
\quad 41+ & 3 \\
\textbf{Education} & \\
\quad Undergraduate & 30 \\
\quad Graduate & 15 \\
\quad Other & 5 \\
\textbf{Technical Background} & \\
\quad CS/Engineering & 28 \\
\quad Other STEM & 12 \\
\quad Non-technical & 10 \\
% ❌ DON'T INCLUDE:
% \textbf{Institution} & \\
% \quad Stanford University & 50 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% ✅ ADD NOTE:
Note: Participants were recruited from [a single institution / multiple 
institutions] to control for [specific factor]. Institutional affiliation 
anonymized for review.
```

#### **2.3 Qualitative Data (Quotes, Screenshots)**

**Participant Quote Anonymization:**

```latex
% ❌ IDENTIFYING QUOTE:
P7: "I work at Google, and we use similar AI tools. This interface 
reminds me of our internal systems."

% ✅ ANONYMIZED:
P7: "I work at a technology company, and we use similar AI tools. 
This interface reminds me of our internal systems."

% ✅ REDACTED (if still identifying):
P7: "I work at [a technology company], and we use similar AI tools. 
This interface reminds me of [internal systems]."
```

**Screenshot Anonymization Checklist:**
- [ ] Remove/blur institution names in title bars
- [ ] Remove/blur participant names
- [ ] Remove/blur email addresses
- [ ] Remove/blur internal tool names
- [ ] Remove/blur institutional logos
- [ ] Remove/blur URLs with institution names
- [ ] Remove/blur timestamps that reveal timezone
- [ ] Remove/blur any identifying background elements

**Screenshot Preparation Script:**
```python
# Use this to batch-process screenshots
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

def anonymize_screenshot(image_path, regions_to_blur):
    """
    Blur specific regions of screenshot
    
    regions_to_blur: list of (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates
    """
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    
    for region in regions_to_blur:
        # Draw black rectangle over identifying info
        draw.rectangle(region, fill='black')
    
    # Add anonymization notice
    font = ImageFont.load_default()
    draw.text((10, 10), "[Institution name redacted for review]", 
              fill='red', font=font)
    
    img.save(image_path.replace('.png', '_anon.png'))

# Example usage:
anonymize_screenshot(
    'interface_screenshot.png',
    regions_to_blur=[
        (0, 0, 200, 50),      # Title bar
        (800, 0, 1000, 30),   # Email address
        (50, 500, 300, 550)   # Logo
    ]
)
```

### **🟢 BEST PRACTICES (Strengthens Anonymization)**

#### **3.1 LaTeX Metadata Stripping**

**Remove PDF Metadata:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Strip all metadata from PDF before submission

# Method 1: Using exiftool
exiftool -all:all= paper.pdf
mv paper.pdf_original paper_with_metadata.pdf
mv paper.pdf paper_anonymous.pdf

# Method 2: Using pdftk
pdftk paper.pdf dump_data output metadata.txt
# Edit metadata.txt to remove author info
pdftk paper.pdf update_info metadata_clean.txt output paper_anonymous.pdf

# Method 3: Using qpdf
qpdf --empty --pages paper.pdf -- paper_anonymous.pdf

# Verify metadata removed:
exiftool paper_anonymous.pdf | grep -i author
# Should return nothing
```

**LaTeX Anonymization Template:**
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}

% CRITICAL: Configure hyperref for anonymization
\hypersetup{
    pdftitle={Paper Title},
    pdfauthor={},  % LEAVE EMPTY
    pdfsubject={},
    pdfkeywords={keyword1, keyword2},
    pdfproducer={LaTeX},
    pdfcreator={pdflatex}
}

% Alternative: Completely disable metadata
\usepackage[pdfauthor={}]{hyperref}

% For submission version, use:
\title{Your Paper Title}
\author{Anonymous Submission}
% \author{} % Or completely empty

% Comment out acknowledgments
% \section*{Acknowledgments}
% We thank [funding agency]...

\begin{document}
\maketitle
```

#### **3.2 Git History Anonymization**

**If Sharing Code via GitHub:**

```bash
# Method 1: Create clean repository (RECOMMENDED)
# 1. Create new directory
mkdir paper-code-anonymous
cd paper-code-anonymous

# 2. Copy only necessary files (no .git/)
cp -r ../original-project/src .
cp -r ../original-project/data .
cp ../original-project/requirements.txt .

# 3. Create new git repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for review"

# 4. Push to anonymous GitHub or Anonymous 4 Open Science
# https://anonymous.4open.science/

# Method 2: Rewrite git history (ADVANCED)
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch README_internal.md" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Remove author info from commits
git filter-branch --env-filter '
  export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Anonymous"
  export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="anonymous@review.com"
  export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Anonymous"
  export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="anonymous@review.com"
' --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

**Anonymous Repository Services:**
- **Anonymous GitHub**: https://anonymous.4open.science/
  - Temporary anonymous view of GitHub repos
  - Expires after conference review period
  - No GitHub account visible
  
- **CodeOcean**: https://codeocean.com/
  - Provides DOI for reproducibility
  - Can be made anonymous during review
  
- **Zenodo Sandbox**: https://sandbox.zenodo.org/
  - Anonymous uploads
  - Gets DOI (can be embargoed)

#### **3.3 Filename & Directory Anonymization**

**Check for Identifying Names:**
```bash
# Scan for identifying strings in code/data
grep -r "Stanford" ./code/
grep -r "smith@university.edu" ./code/
grep -r "internal-project-name" ./code/

# Common places to check:
# - File headers/comments
# - Configuration files
# - Log outputs
# - Data file paths
# - Import statements
# - Documentation
```

**Anonymization Script:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import re

IDENTIFYING_PATTERNS = [
    r'Stanford',
    r'MIT',
    r'smith@',
    r'john\.doe',
    r'internal-tool-name',
    r'project-codename'
]

def anonymize_file(filepath):
    """Remove identifying information from file"""
    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    original_content = content
    
    for pattern in IDENTIFYING_PATTERNS:
        content = re.sub(pattern, '[REDACTED]', content, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    
    if content != original_content:
        print(f"Anonymized: {filepath}")
        with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)

# Scan all files
for root, dirs, files in os.walk('./code'):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith(('.py', '.txt', '.md', '.yaml', '.json')):
            anonymize_file(os.path.join(root, file))
```
