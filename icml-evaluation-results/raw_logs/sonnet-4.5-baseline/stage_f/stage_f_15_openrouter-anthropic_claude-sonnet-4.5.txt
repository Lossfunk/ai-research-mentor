#### **Step 2: Implement Major Revisions**

**New Experiments Required:**
```bash
# Run additional experiments requested by reviewers

# Statistical significance tests
python scripts/statistical_tests.py \
  --results results/main_results.json \
  --method bootstrap \
  --n_samples 10000 \
  --output results/significance_tests.json

# Low-resource language analysis
python scripts/analyze_low_resource.py \
  --languages sw,yo,am,my,km \
  --output results/low_resource_analysis.json

# Human evaluation
python scripts/human_eval_analysis.py \
  --annotations data/human_eval/annotations.csv \
  --output results/human_eval_results.json
```

**Update Tables with New Results:**
```latex
% Table 3: Updated with statistical significance
\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Cross-lingual dialogue performance (BLEU scores). 
Statistical significance tested with bootstrap (10K samples): 
* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 vs. mBART baseline.}
\label{tab:main_results}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Model & en→zh & en→ar & en→hi & en→sw & Avg \\
\midrule
mBART & 23.4 & 19.2 & 21.7 & 15.3 & 19.9 \\
mT5 & 24.1 & 19.8 & 22.3 & 16.1 & 20.6 \\
XLM-R & 22.8 & 18.5 & 20.9 & 14.7 & 19.2 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Ours} & \textbf{26.3***} & \textbf{21.4**} & \textbf{24.1***} & \textbf{17.8**} & \textbf{22.4***} \\

for filename in os.listdir(figures_dir):
    if filename.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):
        img = Image.open(os.path.join(figures_dir, filename))
        dpi = img.info.get('dpi', (72, 72))
        if dpi[0] < min_dpi or dpi[1] < min_dpi:
            print(f"⚠️  {filename}: {dpi} DPI (should be {min_dpi}+)")
        else:
