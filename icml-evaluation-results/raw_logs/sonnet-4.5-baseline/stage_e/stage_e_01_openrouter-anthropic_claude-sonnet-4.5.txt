Based on my knowledge of the PeerRead dataset and common methodological concerns in peer review prediction research, I can help you anticipate reviewer concerns about the 'probably-rejected' labels for arXiv papers. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

## Key Reviewer Concerns

### 1. **Label Inference Validity**
**Concern:** The 'probably-rejected' label is inferred rather than directly observed. Papers on arXiv that never appeared at a venue may have been:
- Never submitted anywhere
- Submitted but withdrawn before review
- Still under review
- Rejected but later accepted elsewhere
- Intentionally kept as preprints

**Mitigations for Discussion:**
- Acknowledge this as a fundamental limitation with transparency
- Provide statistics on typical submission patterns (e.g., "X% of arXiv papers are eventually published within Y years")
- Conduct sensitivity analyses showing robustness across different time windows
- Consider a temporal analysis: papers from earlier years are more likely to have been truly rejected if unpublished

### 2. **Class Imbalance and Selection Bias**
**Concern:** ArXiv papers represent a biased sample - authors choosing to post preprints may differ systematically from those who don't.

**Mitigations:**
- Discuss the specific population your model applies to (arXiv-posting researchers)
- Compare characteristics of arXiv vs. non-arXiv papers in your accepted set
- Frame findings as applicable to "publicly shared preprints" rather than all submissions
- Consider this as a feature: many modern submission systems now accept/require preprints

### 3. **Temporal Confounding**
**Concern:** Publication lag means recent arXiv papers may not have had time to be accepted.

**Mitigations:**
- Establish a clear time cutoff (e.g., only include arXiv papers >2 years old)
- Report the distribution of time-to-publication for accepted papers
- Perform stratified analysis by arXiv posting date
- Consider survival analysis approaches to account for censoring

### 4. **Multiple Submission Attempts**
**Concern:** "Rejected" papers may eventually be accepted after revision and resubmission to other venues.

**Mitigations:**
- Frame the task as predicting "initial rejection likelihood" or "acceptance difficulty"
- Search for later versions of papers in other venues/proceedings
- Acknowledge that the label represents "not accepted at time T" rather than "permanently rejected"
- Argue this still provides valuable signal for quality assessment

### 5. **Venue-Specific Factors**
**Concern:** Rejection may reflect poor venue fit rather than quality.

**Mitigations:**
- Control for venue-specific acceptance rates in analysis
- Perform subgroup analyses by venue type/prestige
- Include venue matching as a feature if applicable
- Discuss how "fit" is itself a component of acceptance decisions

## Proposed Discussion Section Structure

### A. Limitations Subsection

```
**Label Validity:** Our 'probably-rejected' labels are inferred from 
the absence of publication rather than direct observation. While this 
introduces uncertainty, we argue this represents a realistic scenario 
for automated screening systems. We mitigated this concern by:
(1) only including arXiv papers posted >24 months before data collection,
(2) manually sampling 100 'probably-rejected' papers and finding X% 
had evidence of submission/rejection, and (3) showing consistent results
across different temporal thresholds.

**Population Generalizability:** Our findings apply specifically to 
papers shared as preprints, which may differ from the broader submission 
pool. However, this population is increasingly relevant as preprint 
sharing becomes standard practice in [field].
```

### B. Validation Studies to Include

1. **Manual Verification Study:**
   - Sample 100-200 "probably-rejected" papers
   - Search for evidence of submission (author CVs, acknowledgments, later versions)
   - Report the estimated false positive rate

2. **Temporal Validation:**
   - Show model performance is stable across different arXiv posting date ranges
   - Demonstrate that older papers (more likely truly rejected) show similar patterns

3. **Cross-Venue Validation:**
   - Test on venues where you have ground truth rejections
   - Show features/patterns generalize

4. **Positive Control:**
   - Identify papers that were explicitly rejected then posted to arXiv with revision history
   - Show these are classified similarly to "probably-rejected" papers

### C. Reframing Strategies

Instead of framing as "rejection prediction," consider:
- **"Publication difficulty prediction"** - acknowledges the spectrum
- **"Peer review outcome forecasting"** - more neutral terminology  
- **"Acceptance likelihood estimation"** - focuses on the positive class
- **"Automated quality assessment"** - emphasizes utility over ground truth

### D. Positive Framing

**Strengths to emphasize:**
- Large-scale dataset that would be impossible to obtain with true rejection labels
- Real-world applicability to preprint screening
- Conservative estimates (false positives are unpublished good papers, which is a safe error direction for some applications)
- Noisy label learning is a feature: shows robustness of approach

## Additional Technical Mitigations

1. **Confidence-weighted learning:** Down-weight uncertain labels
2. **PU learning:** Treat as Positive-Unlabeled learning problem
3. **Noise modeling:** Explicitly model label noise in your framework
4. **Ensemble with other signals:** Combine with citation counts, author reputation, etc.
