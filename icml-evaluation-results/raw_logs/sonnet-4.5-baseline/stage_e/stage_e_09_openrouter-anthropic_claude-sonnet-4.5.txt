## Discussion: Enhancing Robustness Through Crowd-Sourced Annotations

Here's a comprehensive framework for crowd-sourced annotation improvements:

## **MAIN TEXT DISCUSSION (Section 6.X)**

### **6.X Enhancing Dataset Robustness Through Crowd-Sourced Annotations**

```markdown
While our dataset provides valuable ground truth from actual peer review 
outcomes, several limitations could be addressed through crowd-sourced 
annotations from the broader research community:

#### 6.X.1 Motivation for Crowd-Sourced Augmentation

Expert peer reviews, while authoritative, suffer from three key limitations:

1. **Limited Coverage**: Each paper receives 2-4 reviews, providing sparse 
   signal on multi-faceted quality dimensions. Crowd-sourcing could increase 
   annotation density from 3 reviews/paper to 10-20 assessments/paper.

2. **Reviewer Subjectivity**: Individual reviewers bring idiosyncratic 
   preferences and biases. Aggregating diverse crowd judgments could provide 
   more stable quality estimates that better approximate consensus.

3. **Validation Gaps**: We cannot verify review quality or identify outlier 
   reviewers. Independent crowd annotations would enable validation of 
   original reviews and identification of systematic biases.

#### 6.X.2 Proposed Crowd-Sourcing Framework

We propose a multi-tiered annotation framework targeting different aspects 
of review quality:

**Tier 1: Lightweight Quality Signals (n=20-50 annotators/paper)**
- Binary judgments: "Is this paper above/below average quality?"
- Pairwise comparisons: "Which of these two papers is stronger?"
- Aspect ratings: 5-point Likert scales for clarity, novelty, soundness
- Time investment: 5-10 minutes per paper
- Annotator pool: Graduate students and researchers in relevant fields

**Tier 2: Structured Review Components (n=5-10 annotators/paper)**
- Identify strengths (select from predefined list + free text)
- Identify weaknesses (select from predefined list + free text)
- Rate review helpfulness of original reviews
- Suggest accept/reject with confidence
- Time investment: 15-20 minutes per paper
- Annotator pool: Experienced researchers (post-PhD)

**Tier 3: Full Mock Reviews (n=3-5 annotators/paper)**
- Write complete review following venue guidelines
- Provide detailed aspect scores with justification
- Make accept/reject recommendation
- Time investment: 45-60 minutes per paper
- Annotator pool: Researchers with prior reviewing experience

**Quality Control Mechanisms**:
- Attention checks: Include papers with known quality (very strong/weak)
- Inter-annotator agreement tracking: Flag low-agreement annotators
- Expert validation: Sample 10% of annotations for expert verification
- Reputation system: Weight annotations by annotator track record
- Redundancy: 3-5× redundant annotations per paper for reliability
```

### **6.X.3 Expected Benefits**

```markdown
Crowd-sourced annotations would enable several robustness improvements:

**1. Validation of Original Reviews**
Compare crowd consensus to original reviewer assessments to identify:
- Outlier reviews that deviate from consensus
- Systematic venue-specific biases
- Temporal drift in review standards
- Correlation between review quality and crowd agreement

**2. Enhanced Ground Truth for Borderline Cases**
Our models struggle most on borderline papers (acceptance probability 
0.4-0.6), which constitute 44% of our dataset. Crowd annotations could:
- Provide higher-confidence labels through aggregation
- Enable confidence weighting in model training
- Identify genuinely ambiguous cases vs. reviewer errors

**3. Demographic and Fairness Analysis**
With diverse crowd annotators, we could assess:
- Whether acceptance patterns vary by annotator demographics
- Potential biases in original reviews
- Consistency of quality judgments across different research communities

**4. Multi-Perspective Quality Assessment**
Different annotator groups (junior vs. senior, academic vs. industry) may 
emphasize different quality dimensions. This diversity enables:
- Training specialized models for different use cases
- Understanding which quality aspects are universal vs. context-dependent
- Providing multi-stakeholder perspectives on paper quality

**5. Continuous Dataset Improvement**
A living annotation platform would enable:
- Ongoing data collection as new papers appear
- Tracking evolving review standards over time
- Community engagement and dataset ownership

### **6.X.4 Implementation Considerations**

```markdown
**Platform and Infrastructure**:
We propose building on existing annotation platforms (e.g., Prolific, 
Amazon MTurk for Tier 1; custom platform for Tiers 2-3) with:
- Integration with arXiv/OpenReview for paper access
- Gamification elements to encourage participation
- API for programmatic access to annotations
- Version control for annotation updates

**Incentive Structures**:
- Monetary compensation: $0.50-1.00 per Tier 1 annotation, $3-5 per Tier 2, 
  $15-25 per Tier 3
- Academic credit: Co-authorship on dataset papers for substantial 
  contributions
- Reputation building: Public leaderboard of top annotators
- Reciprocal reviewing: Annotators can request reviews of their own papers
- Estimated cost: $50K-100K for 2,000 papers with full annotation coverage

**Ethical Considerations**:
- Informed consent from original paper authors
- Privacy protection (anonymize author information for annotation)
- Fair compensation (above minimum wage for annotation time)
- Opt-out mechanism for authors who object to crowd assessment
- Transparent reporting of annotation methodology

**Timeline**:
- Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Platform development and pilot testing (n=100 papers)
- Phase 2 (Months 4-9): Tier 1 annotation collection (n=2,000 papers)
- Phase 3 (Months 10-15): Tier 2-3 annotation collection (n=500 papers)
- Phase 4 (Months 16-18): Analysis and dataset release
```

## **APPENDIX: Crowd-Sourcing Metrics**

### **Appendix X: Crowd-Sourced Annotation Quality Metrics**

We propose tracking the following metrics to assess annotation quality and 
dataset robustness improvements. This appendix will be updated as crowd-
sourced data is collected.

#### **X.5 Impact on Model Performance**

```markdown
**Table X.5: Model Performance with Crowd-Sourced Labels**

Model Training Condition              | Accuracy | F1    | Δ from | Aspect
                                     |          |       | Baseline| Score r
-------------------------------------|----------|-------|--------|--------
Baseline (expert reviews only)       | 76.3%    | 0.745 | -      | 0.48
+ Crowd majority vote labels         | TBD      | TBD   | TBD    | TBD
+ Crowd confidence-weighted labels   | TBD      | TBD   | TBD    | TBD
+ Ensemble (expert + crowd)          | TBD      | TBD   | TBD    | TBD
Crowd labels only (no expert reviews)| TBD      | TBD   | TBD    | TBD

**Hypothesis**: Crowd annotations will improve performance on borderline 
cases through:
1. Higher-quality labels (reduced noise through aggregation)
2. Increased training data (more papers with confident labels)
3. Better calibration (confidence scores from vote distributions)

**Performance on Disagreement Cases**:
- High crowd-expert agreement (>80% consensus): Accuracy = TBD
- Low crowd-expert agreement (<60% consensus): Accuracy = TBD
- Interpretation: [whether disagreement indicates label noise or genuine ambiguity]

aggregation, or reveal biases in original reviews

**Annotator-Level Bias Analysis**:
- Variance in bias across individual annotators: SD = TBD
- Correlation between annotator demographics and bias patterns: r = TBD
- Papers where crowd reduces bias (crowd more equitable): N = TBD
- Papers where crowd amplifies bias (crowd more biased): N = TBD
