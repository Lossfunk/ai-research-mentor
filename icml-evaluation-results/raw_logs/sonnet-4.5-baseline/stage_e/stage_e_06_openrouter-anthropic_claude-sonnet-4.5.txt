## Articulating the "Newer Venues" Limitation

Here's a comprehensive framework for addressing this critical validity threat:

---

## **PART 1: Clear Problem Statement**

### **The Core Issue**

```
Our dataset exhibits temporal and venue maturity bias: established venues 
(ACL, NeurIPS) with long publication histories are overrepresented, while 
newer venues (ICLR post-2017, *ACL workshops, emerging ML conferences) 
are underrepresented or absent. This creates several threats to validity:

1. **Temporal Bias**: Older venues dominate our training data, potentially 
   learning outdated review conventions
   
2. **Establishment Bias**: Mature venues have crystallized review standards; 
   newer venues may have evolving or different conventions
   
3. **Cold-Start Problem**: Our models cannot be evaluated on venues that 
   didn't exist during data collection
   
4. **Selection Bias**: Newer venues may attract different paper types 
   (more interdisciplinary, more applied, more open-access oriented)
```

---

## **PART 2: Quantifying the Problem**

### **Analysis 1: Dataset Composition by Venue Age**

```python
# Characterize temporal distribution
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Compute venue establishment year and data coverage
venue_stats = []
for venue in venues:
    venue_papers = data[data['venue'] == venue]
    
    stats = {
        'venue': venue,
        'first_year_established': VENUE_FOUNDING_YEARS[venue],
        'first_year_in_dataset': venue_papers['year'].min(),
        'last_year_in_dataset': venue_papers['year'].max(),
        'years_of_history': datetime.now().year - VENUE_FOUNDING_YEARS[venue],
        'years_in_dataset': venue_papers['year'].max() - venue_papers['year'].min() + 1,
        'n_papers': len(venue_papers),
        'coverage_ratio': (venue_papers['year'].max() - venue_papers['year'].min() + 1) / 
                          (datetime.now().year - VENUE_FOUNDING_YEARS[venue])
    }
    venue_stats.append(stats)

venue_df = pd.DataFrame(venue_stats)

# Categorize venues by maturity
venue_df['maturity_category'] = pd.cut(
    venue_df['years_of_history'],
    bins=[0, 5, 15, 50],
    labels=['New (0-5yr)', 'Emerging (5-15yr)', 'Established (15+yr)']
)

# Analyze representation
print(venue_df.groupby('maturity_category').agg({
    'n_papers': ['sum', 'mean'],
    'coverage_ratio': 'mean'
}))
```

**Expected Results Table:**

```
Table X: Dataset Composition by Venue Maturity

Venue Maturity    | N Venues | N Papers | % Dataset | Avg Coverage | Mean Years
                  |          |          |           | Ratio        | History
------------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------
Established (15+) | 4        | 8,234    | 68.2%     | 0.82         | 28.5
Emerging (5-15)   | 3        | 2,891    | 23.9%     | 0.61         | 9.3
New (0-5)         | 2        | 945      | 7.8%      | 0.38         | 3.2
------------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------
Total             | 9        | 12,070   | 100%      | 0.68         | 18.7

Examples by category:
- Established: ACL (1963), NeurIPS (1987), CVPR (1985)
- Emerging: ICLR (2013), CoRL (2017)
- New: NeurIPS Datasets Track (2021), EMNLP Industry Track (2020)

Key findings:
- Established venues represent 68.2% of data despite being 44% of venues
- New venues have 38% coverage ratio (missing 62% of their short history)
- Papers per venue decreases with venue age: 2,059 (established) vs. 
  473 (new)
```

**Interpretation to Include:**

```
Our dataset is heavily skewed toward established venues (68.2% of papers), 
which may have different review cultures than newer venues. Critically, 
newer venues show lower coverage ratios (0.38 vs. 0.82), meaning we 
capture less of their review history. This creates two risks: (1) models 
may learn conventions specific to mature venues that don't transfer to 
newer venues, and (2) we cannot validate performance on emerging venues 
that represent the field's future direction.
```

### **Analysis 2: Temporal Drift in Review Conventions**

```python

    venue_papers = data[data['venue'] == venue].sort_values('year')
    
    if len(venue_papers) < 100 or venue_papers['year'].nunique() < 5:
        continue  # Skip venues with insufficient temporal coverage
    
    # Split into early vs. late periods
    median_year = venue_papers['year'].median()
    early_papers = venue_papers[venue_papers['year'] < median_year]
    late_papers = venue_papers[venue_papers['year'] >= median_year]
    
    # Compare review characteristics
    comparison = {
        'venue': venue,

        )[1]
    }
    
    temporal_analysis.append(comparison)

temporal_df = pd.DataFrame(temporal_analysis)

# Test: Train on early period, test on late period
temporal_transfer = {}
for venue in venues:
    venue_papers = data[data['venue'] == venue]
    median_year = venue_papers['year'].median()
    
    train_data = venue_papers[venue_papers['year'] < median_year]
    test_data = venue_papers[venue_papers['year'] >= median_year]
    
    # Train model on early period
    model = train_model(train_data)
    
    # Evaluate on late period
    late_performance = evaluate(model, test_data)
    
    # Compare to in-period performance
    early_model = train_model(train_data)
    early_performance = evaluate(early_model, train_data)  # Overly optimistic
    
    # Better: train/test split within early period
    early_train, early_test = train_test_split(train_data)
    early_model = train_model(early_train)
    early_performance_fair = evaluate(early_model, early_test)
    
    temporal_transfer[venue] = {
        'early_performance': early_performance_fair,
        'late_performance': late_performance,
        'temporal_gap': early_performance_fair - late_performance
    }

Mean temporal gap: -0.10 (SD = 0.04)
* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01

Key findings:
- All venues show increasing review length over time (mean +18%)
- Most venues show declining mean scores (mean drift = -0.12)
- Newer venue (ICLR) shows largest temporal gap (-0.15)
- Models trained on early data show degraded performance on later data
```

**Critical Interpretation:**

```
Significant temporal drift exists even within established venues, with 
models trained on early periods showing performance degradation on later 
periods (mean Δr = -0.10). This drift is most pronounced for newer venues 
(ICLR: Δr = -0.15), suggesting that rapidly evolving venues pose greater 
challenges. The consistent increase in review length (+18% on average) 
and declining mean scores (-0.12) indicate systematic changes in review 
culture that our models must account for. This temporal instability 
compounds the newer venue problem: not only do we have less data for 
newer venues, but their conventions are still evolving.

## **PART 3: Articulating Impact on Generalizability**

### **Discussion Section Text**

```markdown
### 4.X Limitation: Newer Venue Underrepresentation

Our dataset exhibits significant temporal bias, with established venues 
(15+ years old) comprising 68.2% of papers despite representing 44% of 
venues. This creates three threats to generalizability:

**1. Cold-Start Problem for Emerging Venues**
We cannot evaluate our models on venues that emerged after data collection 
or have insufficient review data. This is particularly problematic as 
newer venues often pioneer different review formats (e.g., ICLR's open 
review, NeurIPS Datasets Track's reproducibility focus, TMLR's rolling 
review). Our models may fail on exactly the venues driving methodological 
innovation in peer review.

**2. Temporal Concept Drift**
Even within established venues, review conventions evolve. Models trained 
on early periods (2010-2015) show performance degradation on later periods 
(2016-2021), with a mean temporal gap of Δr = -0.10. This drift is most 
severe for newer venues (ICLR: Δr = -0.15), suggesting that rapidly 
evolving venues are poorly served by historical training data.

**3. Selection Bias in Review Culture**
Newer venues may systematically differ from established venues in ways 
our models cannot capture:
- **Open vs. traditional review**: ICLR's public reviews may elicit 
  different reviewer behavior than traditional blind review
- **Interdisciplinary focus**: Newer venues often bridge fields (e.g., 
  CoRL spanning robotics and ML), requiring different evaluation criteria
- **Democratization**: Newer venues may have more diverse reviewer pools 
  with less consensus on quality standards

Our temporal drift analysis (Table X) shows that review length increased 
18% and mean scores declined 0.12 points over the study period, indicating 
systematic evolution that models trained on historical data may not capture.

**Implications for Deployment**
These limitations suggest our models are most reliable for:
- Established venues with stable review conventions
- Retrospective analysis rather than prospective deployment
- Venues similar to those in our training data

For newer or rapidly evolving venues, we recommend:
- Collecting venue-specific validation data before deployment
- Implementing continuous model updating as new reviews arrive
- Using domain adaptation techniques (Section X.X)
- Maintaining human oversight for high-stakes decisions
