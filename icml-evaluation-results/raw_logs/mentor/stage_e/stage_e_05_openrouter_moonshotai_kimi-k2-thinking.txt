- User level: experienced researcher responding to reviewers.
- Honest take: transferability is weak; must concede limits and reframe contribution.
- Need discussion-style response + concrete new experiments.
- Avoid long lists; focus on 2–3 strong moves.

**Direct response framing:**  
The concern is valid: we do **not** claim that PeerRead aspect models transfer cleanly across domains. Aspect scores are socially and institutionally defined, and their semantics vary by venue and field. Expecting strong out‑of‑domain transfer would be unrealistic. Our claim is narrower: the models capture *review‑process regularities within a domain*, and the limits of transfer are themselves informative.

**How to justify this without sounding defensive:**  
Emphasize that aspect prediction depends on *reviewer norms*, not just paper content. Domain shift therefore breaks both the input distribution and the labeling function. Poor transfer is evidence that aspects are context‑dependent constructs, not universal quality axes. This reframes limited transfer as a finding, not a failure.

**Targeted experiments reviewers will find credible:**

- **Leave‑one‑venue‑out evaluation.**  
Train on all but one venue (or year) and test on the held‑out set. Even modest above‑chance performance supports partial transfer; sharp drops quantify domain dependence explicitly.

- **Aspect‑specific transfer analysis.**  
Show that some aspects (e.g., clarity) transfer better than others (e.g., novelty). This demonstrates nuance and aligns with reviewer intuition.

- **Feature‑family transfer ablation.**  
Repeat transfer experiments with and without hand‑engineered reviewer signals. If text‑only models degrade less, you can argue that non‑transferability is driven by reviewer practices, not language modeling.

**Key sentence to include in the discussion:**  
> “Rather than aiming for universal aspect predictors, our results suggest that aspect scores are best understood as domain‑conditioned signals; measuring where transfer fails helps delineate which aspects reflect shared evaluative criteria versus local reviewing norms.”

That both concedes the limitation and shows intellectual control over it.
