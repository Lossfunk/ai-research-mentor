**Blunt assessment:** this *does* limit generalizability, and reviewers are right to worry. Underpowered labeling for newer venues means your results are disproportionately shaped by older, better‑represented venues and review cultures. If you imply broad applicability, that’s an overclaim.

**How to articulate the limitation clearly:**  
State that the labeling process implicitly weights venues by historical data availability. As a result, models trained on PeerRead primarily learn patterns from mature venues with stable reviewing norms, and may underperform or behave unpredictably on newer venues where reviewer calibration, aspect definitions, and acceptance criteria are still evolving. This is a *coverage bias*, not just noise: newer venues are systematically different, not just smaller.

**Concrete follow‑up experiment reviewers will accept:**  
Propose (or add, if feasible) a **temporal hold‑out experiment**: train models only on data up to year *T* and evaluate exclusively on submissions from newer venues introduced after *T*. Report both absolute performance and degradation relative to in‑distribution test sets. Even if performance drops, this directly quantifies the generalization gap and shows you’re not hiding it.

If adding data is possible, suggest a small‑scale **targeted annotation study** for one newer venue (e.g., re‑label a few hundred papers with consistent aspect definitions) and show whether performance recovers with minimal supervision. This reassures reviewers that the issue is data scarcity, not a fundamental modeling flaw.

**Key sentence to include:**  
> “Our conclusions primarily reflect well‑established venues; explicit temporal hold‑out results quantify how performance degrades on newer venues, clarifying the limits of generalization under sparse supervision.”

That’s honest, bounded, and reviewer‑proof.
