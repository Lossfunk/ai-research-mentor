- User level: experienced researcher, paper in review.
- Task: identify critical threats + propose analyses to preempt critiques.
- Need blunt prioritization, not exhaustive list.
- Pick 2–3 threats and matching analyses.

**Bottom line:** the biggest validity risks are *systematic selection bias*, *label noise tied to review practices*, and *confounding by author/venue effects*. If you don’t address these head‑on, reviewers will assume your results are artifacts.

**1. Selection bias from data linkage (arXiv ↔ reviews).**  
Only a subset of reviewed papers can be matched to arXiv, and that subset is not random (field, seniority, openness norms).  
**Preemptive analysis:** compare matched vs. unmatched submissions on observable review metadata (scores, confidence, length of reviews). Show they’re broadly similar, or explicitly quantify the skew and argue why it doesn’t explain the main results.

**2. Label noise and inconsistency across venues/reviewers.**  
Aspect scores and decisions are weakly standardized; reviewer calibration varies widely.  
**Preemptive analysis:** report inter‑reviewer variance where available and correlate it with model error. If performance drops where variance is high, that supports the “noise ceiling” argument rather than model failure.

**3. Confounding signals unrelated to paper content.**  
Models may exploit proxies like author prestige, institution, or formatting artifacts rather than substantive quality.  
**Preemptive analysis:** conduct controlled ablations or stratified evaluations (e.g., anonymized vs. non‑anonymized settings, early‑career vs. senior‑heavy subsets if inferable). Even coarse controls help.

**How to frame this in the paper:**  
Be explicit that PeerRead reflects *the review process as observed*, not an unbiased measure of scientific merit. State that identified biases are properties of the ecosystem being modeled, and your analyses test robustness to them rather than deny their existence.

**Crucial sentence:**  
> “Our analyses aim to characterize patterns in observed peer review behavior under known selection and labeling biases, not to recover an unbiased notion of paper quality.”

That framing turns threats into context instead of fatal flaws.
