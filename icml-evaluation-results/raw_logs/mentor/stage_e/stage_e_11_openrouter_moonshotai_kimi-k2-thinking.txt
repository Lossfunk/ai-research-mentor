- User level: experienced researcher.
- Need to predict the sharpest critique and give rebuttal strategy.
- Likely critique: error analysis is anecdotal / cherry-picked / not diagnostic.
- Provide concrete mitigation steps.

**Most pointed critique you should expect:**  
“The error analysis is anecdotal and confirmatory. It cherry‑picks examples that fit the authors’ narrative and does not diagnose *systematic* failure modes or causal drivers of errors.”

Reviewers use this when they think the analysis is cosmetic rather than explanatory.

**Proactive mitigation strategy for the rebuttal:**  
Concede the limitation directly, then show you’ve turned the error analysis into a *structured diagnostic*, not a story.

State that you will (or did) augment the section with a **quantitative error breakdown** along dimensions already present in PeerRead: review disagreement level, score margin, venue/year, and dominance of hand‑engineered features in the prediction. Emphasize that examples are sampled *from these buckets*, not hand‑selected. This reframes examples as illustrations of statistically identified regimes.

Crucially, argue that the most frequent errors occur in **high‑disagreement and borderline cases**, where even human reviewers lack consensus. That positions errors as reflecting intrinsic ambiguity rather than model pathology.

**Sentence to include verbatim or close to it:**  
> “We have revised the error analysis to ground qualitative examples in quantitatively defined error regimes, showing that most failures arise in high‑uncertainty review settings rather than from isolated lexical artifacts.”

That sentence directly neutralizes the “anecdotal” attack and signals methodological seriousness.
