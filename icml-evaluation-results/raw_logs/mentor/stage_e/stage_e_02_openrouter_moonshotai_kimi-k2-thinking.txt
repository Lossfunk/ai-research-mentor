**Straight assessment:** modest gains are a real weakness. If you present them as “performance improvements,” reviewers will shrug. If you frame them as evidence of *task difficulty and label ceiling*, they become defensible—and even informative.

**How to frame the limitations (don’t sugarcoat):**  
Lead by saying the aspect‑score task is **intrinsically noisy and underspecified**. PeerRead aspect scores are sparse, inconsistently defined across venues, and weakly grounded in reviewer calibration. Under those conditions, large gains are implausible; modest gains likely reflect a performance ceiling imposed by annotation noise rather than model capacity. Explicitly say that the results should be interpreted as *signal detection above noise*, not strong predictive accuracy.

Emphasize that aspects are **entangled** (e.g., novelty vs. impact), making independent prediction ill‑posed. Reviewers will recognize this as a structural limitation, not a modeling failure.

**Contingency plan for future work (pick one clear direction):**  
Position future work around **reformulating the task**, not “trying better models.” The strongest move is to argue that aspect prediction should shift from point estimates to **relative or contrastive judgments** (e.g., pairwise comparisons or within‑paper aspect tradeoffs), which are more aligned with how reviewers actually reason and are empirically more learnable under noise. This shows you understand *why* the current setup underperforms.

Optionally note that collecting *denser, better‑defined aspect annotations* or exploiting reviewer text directly to derive latent aspects would be necessary before expecting large gains—but make it clear that this is a data problem, not an architecture gap.

**Key sentence to include:**  
> “The modest improvements likely reflect a ceiling imposed by noisy, entangled aspect labels rather than insufficient modeling power; meaningful progress will require rethinking the formulation of aspect supervision itself.”

That signals maturity and defuses “why are the gains so small?” immediately.
