- User level: experienced ML/NLP researcher.
- Task: predict reviewer expectations for ablations/error analysis, focused on hand-engineered features.
- Be blunt about what’s mandatory vs nice-to-have.
- Avoid long lists; pick the critical few.

**Short answer:** reviewers will *absolutely* expect you to prove that the gains aren’t coming from trivial or leaky hand‑engineered features. If you don’t, they’ll assume the model is gaming the dataset.

**The ablations they’ll expect (these are non‑negotiable):**

1. **Feature family removal, not individual features.**  
You need coarse ablations: text‑only vs. non‑text features; then text + one feature family at a time (e.g., review length/structure, score statistics, reviewer confidence). This shows whether acceptance prediction is dominated by superficial signals.

2. **“Reviewer effort” controls.**  
Explicitly ablate features correlated with review verbosity (length, number of comments, lexical diversity). Reviewers know these proxy for engagement, not quality. If performance collapses without them, you must say so and interpret accordingly.

3. **Score‑free setting.**  
If any numeric scores or aspect ratings are used, you need a setting with *all scores removed*. Otherwise, reviewers will say you’re just learning the decision rule already embedded in the scores.

**Error analyses they’ll expect:**

- **False positives vs. false negatives by feature dominance.**  
Qualitatively inspect cases where hand‑engineered features strongly favor acceptance but the outcome is rejection (and vice versa). This demonstrates you understand failure modes, not just averages.

- **Borderline cases.**  
Analyze papers with mixed reviews or narrow score margins. Reviewers expect to see that your model struggles there—and that’s okay if you explain it as inherent ambiguity.

**How to frame outcomes (important):**  
If hand‑engineered features dominate, don’t apologize. Say the task largely reflects *reviewer signaling and aggregation*, and your model captures that. What reviewers won’t forgive is pretending the model is assessing intrinsic paper quality.

**One sentence you should include:**  
> “Ablations show that most predictive power arises from reviewer‑provided signals rather than manuscript text, indicating that acceptance classification primarily models decision aggregation rather than independent quality assessment.”

That sentence preempts the main attack.
