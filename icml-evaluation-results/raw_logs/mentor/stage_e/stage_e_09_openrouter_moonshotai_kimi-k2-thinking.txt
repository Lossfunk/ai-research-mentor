- User level: experienced researcher polishing discussion/appendix.
- Honest take: crowdsourcing helps, but only if scoped; reviewers will worry about quality.
- Need short discussion + concrete metrics, not grand claims.

**Short discussion draft:**  
Additional crowd‑sourced annotations could strengthen the robustness claims of PeerRead by reducing reliance on sparse, venue‑specific reviewer signals and by making label uncertainty explicit. Importantly, the value of crowdsourcing here is not to approximate acceptance decisions—which are institutionally grounded—but to provide *redundant, independent judgments* on aspects such as clarity, soundness, or perceived contribution. These auxiliary labels can be used to quantify annotation noise, calibrate existing aspect scores, and test whether observed modeling trends persist under alternative supervision. We emphasize that such annotations complement, rather than replace, authentic peer‑review data.

**Appendix metrics reviewers will expect you to track:**  
- **Inter‑annotator agreement** (e.g., Krippendorff’s α) per aspect, to demonstrate which aspects are inherently unstable.  
- **Crowd–reviewer correlation**, measuring alignment between crowd labels and original PeerRead aspect scores.  
- **Model performance sensitivity**, i.e., changes in rankings or error when trained/evaluated with crowd labels versus original labels.

**Key sentence to include:**  
> “Crowd‑sourced annotations primarily serve as a robustness probe—testing which conclusions survive alternative, noisier supervision—rather than as a substitute for real peer‑review judgments.”

That keeps claims modest and defensible.
