Experienced user. Need concrete heuristics + evaluation. Key is to be blunt: heuristics can match structure cues but not semantics; parity must be narrowly defined. Provide metrics and error analysis.

**Blunt assessment:** Rule-based cues can approximate *structural boundaries* surprisingly well, but they will not replicate hierarchical *reasoning*. If you define parity too broadly, this will fail. Define parity narrowly: boundary detection and routing efficiency, not end-task accuracy.

## Prototype heuristics (pre-inference only)
Keep them deterministic and cheap.

- **Section headers:** regex + typography cues (all-caps, numbering, markdown headers). Treat as hard boundaries.
- **Discourse markers:** lexicon-based triggers (“however,” “in summary,” “methods,” “limitations”) with sentence-level scope.
- **Layout cues:** paragraph length spikes, bullet/list starts, code fences.
- **Window routing:** map tokens to pseudo-levels (sentence → paragraph → section) and pre-chunk accordingly.

Output is a **structure graph** (segments + parent links), not summaries.

---

## How to integrate
Feed the model **the same tokens**, but:
- Use heuristic segments to set attention masks or chunk ordering.
- No learned parameters, no training-time changes.

This keeps the comparison clean.

---

## Metrics (define parity precisely)
Primary (structure-level):
- **Boundary F1** vs. the Hierarchical Transformer’s induced boundaries.
- **Segment purity:** proportion of segments containing a single gold topic (if available).

Secondary (downstream, diagnostic):
- **Efficiency at fixed accuracy:** latency/memory for matched task performance.
- **Long-context recall:** accuracy conditioned on dependencies crossing ≥K segments.

Do not lead with overall accuracy; that confounds semantics.

---

## Error analysis (where heuristics will lose)
Predefine buckets:
- **False splits:** rhetorical markers inside a coherent section.
- **Missed merges:** long sections without explicit headers.
- **Semantic drift:** structurally correct segments that group unrelated content.

For each bucket, show examples and quantify frequency.

---

## Decision rule
If heuristics match boundary F1 and recover most efficiency gains but trail on long-range dependencies, conclude: **hierarchy helps mainly via learned semantics, not structure discovery**. That’s a useful, honest result.

If you want, tell me the document genre—I can tune the marker lexicon to avoid obvious false splits.
