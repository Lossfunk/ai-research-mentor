Experienced researcher. Need a defensible user study. Key risk: vague “alignment” claims without operationalization. I should define a concrete task, modest sample size with power logic, and a clean analysis.

**Blunt assessment:** Most user studies on “alignment with human structure” are hand-wavy. If you don’t force humans to make *decisions* that the hierarchy claims to capture, reviewers will treat this as anecdotal. You need a task where disagreement is measurable.

## Core study idea
Test whether hierarchical representations correspond to **human-perceived document structure** by comparing *model-induced segmentations* to *human structural judgments* on long documents.

---

## Participants and sample size
- **N ≈ 30–40** participants with graduate-level reading proficiency.
- Power target: detect a medium agreement effect (κ≈0.4 vs 0.2 baseline) with 80% power.
- Each participant annotates a subset; use overlapping assignments to estimate reliability.

More participants with shallow annotation is worse than fewer with careful work.

---

## Instruments (keep it concrete)
- **Segmentation task:** participants mark section boundaries and rate boundary strength (weak/strong).
- **Structure justification:** short forced-choice questions (“Which earlier section supports this claim?”).
- **Trust probe:** Likert-scale ratings on whether the document’s organization “makes sense” when guided by model summaries.

Use the same documents the model processes; no synthetic examples.

---

## Model conditions
- Hierarchical Transformer–derived structure (e.g., top-level token summaries mapped to sections).
- Flat baseline structure (e.g., uniform chunking).

Participants are blinded to condition.

---

## Analysis plan
- Primary metric: **agreement** between human boundaries and model-induced boundaries (Cohen’s κ / windowed F1).
- Secondary: task accuracy on justification questions.
- Use **mixed-effects models** (participant and document as random effects) to compare hierarchy vs flat.
- Report inter-annotator agreement to bound achievable alignment.

## What you can legitimately claim
If hierarchy shows higher agreement *and* humans answer structure questions more accurately, you can claim **representational alignment**. Anything weaker should be framed as suggestive, not confirmatory.

If you want, tell me the document domain (legal, scientific, narrative). The domain choice matters more than the model here.
