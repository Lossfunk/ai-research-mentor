User is experienced. Topic is clear but risky: “compressible LLMs” can be vague and already crowded (quantization, pruning). Need to frame tightly around a defensible, testable contribution (e.g., learned compression operators with controllable loss). No need to ask context. Lead with honest assessment. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
“Compressible LLMs” is only publishable if you go beyond *standard post‑hoc compression* (quantization, pruning, LoRA). Reviewers will kill anything that looks like “we compress more.” You need a **principled notion of compressibility** (what structure is exploited, when, and why) and **clear tradeoffs** between compression ratio, downstream loss, and adaptability.

Below is a plan that assumes your core claim is: *LLMs can be trained to expose internal low-entropy structure that enables aggressive, task-preserving compression at inference time.*

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
LLMs are massively overparameterized relative to specific deployment regimes (domain, task set, context length). Existing compression methods are mostly *after-the-fact* and brittle: once compressed, models lose adaptability or require retraining.

**Core idea.**  
Train LLMs to be **explicitly compressible** by learning internal representations (weights, activations, or token-level states) that admit **adaptive, information-theoretic compression** with bounded loss.

**Goal.**  
Show that:
- Compressibility can be **learned during pretraining or finetuning**, not just imposed afterward.
- The same base model supports **multiple compression ratios** without retraining.
- Compression-aware models degrade more gracefully than standard LLMs.

**Claim reviewers should believe if you succeed:**  
Compression is not just an engineering trick—it is a *learnable inductive bias*.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Compression-aware training vs post-hoc compression

**Hypothesis.**  
Models trained with compression-aware objectives retain performance better under aggressive compression than standard LLMs.

**Setup.**  
- Base model: 1–7B parameter transformer.
- Train with an auxiliary loss encouraging low-entropy weight blocks or activations (e.g., predictability, low-rank structure).
- Apply identical post-hoc compression (quantization + pruning) to both models.

**Baselines.**  
- Standard pretraining + post-hoc compression  
- QAT (quantization-aware training)

**Metrics.**  
Perplexity, downstream task accuracy, performance vs compression ratio curves.

**Expected outcome.**  
Compression-aware models dominate the Pareto frontier (lower loss at same size).

---

### Experiment 2: Adaptive compression at inference time

**Hypothesis.**  
Compression-aware LLMs can dynamically trade accuracy for compute/size *per request*.

**Setup.**  
- Learn a controllable compression knob (e.g., rank truncation, token-state sparsification).
- Vary compression at inference without retraining.
- Evaluate across tasks of varying difficulty.

**Baselines.**  
- Static compressed models  
- Mixture-of-experts with routing

**Metrics.**  
Latency, memory, accuracy; slope of degradation as compression increases.

**Expected outcome.**  
Smooth, predictable degradation rather than sharp collapse.

---

### Experiment 3: Where is compressibility located?

**Hypothesis.**  
Compressibility is unevenly distributed across layers, heads, and token positions.

**Setup.**  
- Structured ablations: compress only early layers, only MLPs, only attention.
- Token-wise compression conditioned on entropy or attention dispersion.

**Baselines.**  
- Uniform compression  
- Random structure removal

**Metrics.**  
Task accuracy, calibration, interpretability diagnostics.

**Expected outcome.**  
Clear identification of “compression-safe” substructures.

## 4. Resources

**Compute.**  
- 4–8 GPUs (A100-class) for training; single GPU for inference tests.

**Tools.**  
- PyTorch + FSDP  
- BitsAndBytes / custom quantization kernels  
- Weights & Biases for tradeoff tracking

**Datasets.**  
- The Pile or equivalent open corpus  
- Standard downstream eval suites (GLUE-style, reasoning benchmarks)

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Incremental vs prior work | Desk reject | Emphasize *learned* compressibility |
| Gains only at small scale | Weak claim | Show scaling trends, not just absolute gains |
| Engineering-heavy perception | Reviewer fatigue | Formalize compressibility as a property |
| Training instability | Delays | Start with small models + strong baselines |

---

## 6. Stretch ideas / follow-up

- Information-theoretic bounds on LLM compressibility  
- Joint compression + continual learning  
- Compressible multimodal models (vision–language)

**Evidence note.**  
There is **no single canonical benchmark or theory for “compressible LLMs.”** Existing work spans quantization, pruning, low-rank adaptation, and MoE, but lacks a unified framing. You should explicitly argue this gap and position your work as filling it. If reviewers ask for theory, a lightweight entropy or MDL-based analysis will help.

---

**Optional next step:**  
Decide whether your *main contribution* is **training methodology** or **adaptive inference**—trying to sell both equally will weaken the paper.
