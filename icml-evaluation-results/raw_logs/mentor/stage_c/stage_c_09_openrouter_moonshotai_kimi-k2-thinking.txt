<thinking>
Experienced researcher. Topic is viable but reviewer-sensitive: interpretability must be tied to safety-relevant failures and governance, not just pretty saliency maps. Need a concrete evaluation protocol, ablations, and decision checkpoints. One-year timeline requested (not six months). No web search needed; datasets/tools are standard. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
This will only land if you **evaluate interpretability tools against safety-relevant failure modes** and **treat governance as a first-class artifact** (not an appendix). A generic comparison of saliency methods on mAP will be dismissed. The plan below anchors interpretability to *decision-critical perception errors* and includes go/no‑go checkpoints.

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
Autonomous driving (AD) perception models are safety-critical, yet interpretability tools are rarely evaluated for **faithfulness, stability, or usefulness in real incident analysis**. As a result, organizations lack evidence-based guidance for which tools to trust in audits and post-mortems.

**Goal.**  
Create a **rigorous, reproducible evaluation framework** for interpretability methods applied to AD perception (detection/segmentation), demonstrating:
- which tools are **faithful** to model behavior,
- which are **stable under perturbations**,
- which **meaningfully support governance decisions** (debugging, risk assessment).

**Scope.**  
Camera-centric perception (object detection, semantic segmentation). Planning/control is out of scope.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Faithfulness under causal ablations

**Hypothesis.**  
Many popular interpretability tools are not faithful to AD perception models’ true decision logic.

**Setup.**  
- Models: standard CNN/Transformer-based detectors and segmenters.  
- Interpretability tools: saliency, Grad-CAM variants, feature attribution, concept-based methods.  
- Perform *causal feature ablations* guided by explanations (mask “important” vs “unimportant” regions).

**Baselines.**  
- Random masking  
- Oracle masks from ground-truth object regions

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Performance drop (ΔmAP, ΔIoU), insertion/deletion curves.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Only a subset of tools show strong correlation between attributed importance and causal impact.

---

### Experiment 2: Stability and robustness analysis

**Hypothesis.**  
Unstable explanations undermine governance and audit use, even if accuracy is high.

**Setup.**  
- Apply benign perturbations: lighting shifts, weather simulation, sensor noise.  
- Measure explanation consistency across perturbations with fixed predictions.

**Baselines.**  
- Model output stability  
- Random explanation jitter

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Explanation similarity (e.g., rank correlation), sensitivity indices.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Identification of tools that are too brittle for operational use.

---

### Experiment 3: Failure-mode coverage in safety scenarios

**Hypothesis.**  
Interpretability tools differ in their ability to highlight **known AD failure modes** (e.g., occlusion, long-tail objects).

**Setup.**  
- Curate scenario slices: night driving, occlusions, rare objects.  
- Evaluate whether explanations surface the true cause of failure.

**Baselines.**  
- Error logs without explanations  
- Human intuition alone

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Failure localization accuracy, expert usefulness ratings.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Evidence that some tools systematically miss safety-critical cues.

---

### Experiment 4: Governance utility study

**Hypothesis.**  
Only a subset of interpretability tools meaningfully improve human decision-making in audits.

**Setup.**  
- Simulated audit tasks with engineers/safety analysts.  
- Compare decisions made with different interpretability aids.

**Baselines.**  
- No-interpretability condition  
- Raw model outputs

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Decision accuracy, time-to-resolution, confidence calibration.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Clear ranking of tools by *governance utility*, not aesthetics.

## 3. Timeline (12 months)

**Months 1–2:**  
Model and dataset selection; define safety-relevant failure taxonomy.

**Months 3–4:**  
Implement interpretability tools; baseline reproduction.

**Months 5–6:**  
Faithfulness experiments (Exp. 1) + ablations.

**Months 7–8:**  
Stability and robustness analysis (Exp. 2).

**Months 9–10:**  
Failure-mode and governance utility studies (Exp. 3–4).

**Months 11–12:**  
Synthesis, governance guidelines, paper writing, artifact release.

**Governance checkpoints (hard gates):**  
- Month 2: Scope and claims approval  
- Month 6: Tool faithfulness minimum bar  
- Month 10: Human utility evidence required to proceed

---

## 4. Resources

**Compute.**  
- 2–4 GPUs for perception models; CPU-heavy for analysis.

**Tools.**  
- PyTorch, Captum / similar interpretability libraries  
- Simulation/augmentation tools  
- Annotation and study platforms

**Datasets.**  
- nuScenes, Waymo Open Dataset, or equivalent (camera-focused subsets)

**Evidence note.**  
There is **no agreed-upon standard** for interpretability evaluation in AD. This is a feature, not a bug—explicitly position the framework as filling this gap.

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Too subjective | Weak credibility | Emphasize causal tests |
| Overgeneralization | Reviewer pushback | Limit claims to perception |
| Tool authorship bias | Conflict | Pre-register metrics |
| Human study noise | Inconclusive | Pilot + power analysis |

---

## 6. Stretch ideas / follow-up directions

- Extend to multimodal (camera + lidar) perception  
- Regulatory-facing interpretability checklists  
- Continuous monitoring tools for deployed fleets

---

**Bottom line:**  
This succeeds if you **kill bad interpretability tools**, not if you celebrate them.

**Optional next step:**  
Write a one-page **safety failure taxonomy** for AD perception—every experiment should map to it.
