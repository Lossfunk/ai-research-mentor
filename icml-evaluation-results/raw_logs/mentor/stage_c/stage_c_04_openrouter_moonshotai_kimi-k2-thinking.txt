User likely early–mid researcher, asking meta-research strategy. Need honest assessment: zero compute is not fatal, but excludes large-model training. Provide concrete plan that is publishable without compute: theory, measurement, benchmarks, audits. No tools needed. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
“Zero compute” rules out training new models, but it does **not** rule out meaningful or publishable research. Many strong papers are built on **analysis, evaluation, theory, and data work**. What *won’t* work is pretending you can compete on SOTA training. The plan below is designed to produce a real paper with essentially no GPU usage.

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
ML research is increasingly compute-gated, but **understanding, evaluation, and failure analysis** lag far behind model scaling.

**Goal.**  
Produce a paper that **changes how people interpret results or trust models**, without training anything larger than a linear model.

**Concrete framing.**  
Systematically analyze a widely used model or benchmark and show that:
- reported gains are overstated, or  
- failures are systematic and previously undocumented, or  
- evaluation protocols are flawed.

**Why this works.**  
Reviewers value papers that save the community from **false conclusions**.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Benchmark pathology analysis

**Hypothesis.**  
A popular benchmark (e.g., reasoning, robustness, fairness) contains artifacts that inflate performance.

**Setup.**  
- Use publicly released model predictions or APIs.  
- Perform controlled perturbations, stratification, or adversarial filtering *without retraining*.

**Baselines.**  
- Reported leaderboard results  
- Randomized or heuristic baselines

**Metrics.**  
Performance drop under perturbation, variance across subsets.

**Expected outcome.**  
Clear evidence that headline scores hide systematic weaknesses.

---

### Experiment 2: Model behavior audit

**Hypothesis.**  
Model behavior differs qualitatively across input regimes that are treated as equivalent in evaluations.

**Setup.**  
- Probe models via prompting or feature extraction.  
- Analyze consistency, calibration, or causal sensitivity.

**Baselines.**  
- Simple heuristics  
- Smaller or older models

**Metrics.**  
Calibration error, agreement rates, sensitivity indices.

**Expected outcome.**  
Identification of failure modes that are invisible to standard metrics.

---

### Experiment 3: Reproducibility and statistical validity check

**Hypothesis.**  
Many reported improvements are within noise or depend on unreported choices.

**Setup.**  
- Reanalyze published results using reported numbers, seeds, or released logs.  
- Apply proper statistical tests or uncertainty estimates.

**Baselines.**  
- Original paper claims

**Metrics.**  
Confidence intervals, effect sizes.

**Expected outcome.**  
Demonstration that some “improvements” are not statistically meaningful.

## 3. Timeline (6 months)

**Month 1:**  
Select target benchmark or model family; collect released predictions and metadata.

**Month 2:**  
Design perturbations, subsets, or audits.

**Month 3:**  
Run analyses; generate core plots and tables.

**Month 4:**  
Statistical validation; robustness checks.

**Month 5:**  
Write paper; position contribution clearly.

**Month 6:**  
Community feedback, revision, submission.

## 4. Resources

**Compute.**  
- CPU laptop is sufficient.

**Data.**  
- Public benchmarks  
- Released model outputs  
- API access (optional, low cost)

**Tools.**  
- Python, NumPy, pandas  
- Statistical testing libraries  
- Visualization tools

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Seen as “just analysis” | Weak novelty | Frame as correcting community beliefs |
| Access to outputs limited | Blocked | Use multiple open models |
| Defensive reviewers | Pushback | Be precise, not adversarial |
| Overclaiming | Rejection | Stick to what data proves |

---

## 6. Stretch ideas / follow-up directions

- Formal benchmark redesign proposals  
- Theory explaining observed failures  
- Human–model comparison studies

---

**Key reality check:**  
Zero compute forces **taste and rigor**. That’s a feature, not a bug. Many senior researchers built careers on exactly this kind of work.

**Optional next step:**  
Pick **one widely cited paper or benchmark** you suspect is misleading—and try to break it with analysis alone.
