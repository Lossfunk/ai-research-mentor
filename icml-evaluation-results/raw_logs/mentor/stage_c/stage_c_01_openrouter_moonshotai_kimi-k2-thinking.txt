User is experienced, wants turnkey plan. Topic is broad but acceptable. Need to choose a concrete, defensible angle for GNNs in sea ice, not a vague “apply GNNs”. Lead with assessment: viable but only if framed around graph structure advantages (irregular grids, dynamics). Provide full plan sections. Cite arXiv sparingly. No clarifying questions. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
“GNNs for sea ice” is only publishable if you **explicitly exploit graph structure that CNNs/ViTs cannot** (irregular meshes, Lagrangian ice motion, topology-aware interactions). A generic GNN slapped onto gridded reanalysis will be rejected as unnecessary. The plan below is framed around that constraint.

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
Operational and scientific sea-ice forecasting (concentration, thickness, velocity) still relies on Eulerian grids that poorly represent **ice–ice interactions, fracture, and advection on deforming geometries**. Most recent ML work uses CNNs or diffusion models on fixed grids, which implicitly assume locality and stationarity.

**Core idea.**  
Represent sea ice as a **dynamic graph** (nodes = ice parcels or adaptive spatial cells; edges = physical interactions and transport pathways) and use **spatiotemporal GNNs** to predict short-to-medium-range evolution (1–30 days).

**Goal.**  
Demonstrate that GNNs:
- outperform grid-based ML baselines **under deformation, sparse observations, and coastline complexity**, and  
- provide **physically interpretable interaction signals** (stress propagation, lead formation).

**Target outputs.**  
Sea ice concentration (SIC), velocity (SIV), optionally thickness (SIT).

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Static-graph GNN vs CNN on irregular Arctic mesh

**Hypothesis.**  
On irregular spatial discretizations (e.g., coastal regions, polar cap), GNNs outperform CNNs trained on remapped grids.

**Setup.**  
- Nodes: centroids of adaptive mesh (e.g., EASE-grid cells masked by ice presence).  
- Edges: k-nearest neighbors + distance-weighted adjacency.  
- Model: Graph Convolution + temporal encoder (GRU or temporal attention).  
- Inputs: past SIC/SIV + ERA5 forcings.

**Baselines.**  
- U-Net / ConvLSTM on regular grid  
- Persistence and climatology

**Metrics.**  
RMSE, MAE, anomaly correlation; coastal-region subset scores.

**Expected outcome.**  
Modest global gains, **clear gains near coastlines and marginal ice zones** (where grids distort geometry).

### Experiment 2: Dynamic graph from Lagrangian ice motion

**Hypothesis.**  
Updating graph connectivity using predicted/observed ice velocity improves medium-range forecasts.

**Setup.**  
- Nodes advect with SIV (Lagrangian frame).  
- Edges recomputed each timestep based on proximity and velocity shear.  
- Model: Dynamic GNN with edge-update network.

**Baselines.**  
- Static-graph GNN  
- Eulerian CNN/Transformer

**Metrics.**  
Forecast skill vs lead time (1, 7, 14, 30 days); error growth rate.

**Expected outcome.**  
Slower error accumulation and better structural realism of ice motion.

---

### Experiment 3: Physics-informed edge constraints

**Hypothesis.**  
Encoding physical constraints at edges (e.g., stress limits, divergence penalties) improves generalization.

**Setup.**  
- Add regularization enforcing bounded divergence and smooth stress propagation across edges.  
- Compare learned vs constrained edges.

**Baselines.**  
- Unconstrained GNN  
- Pure data-driven CNN

**Metrics.**  
Physical consistency scores (mass conservation proxies), out-of-distribution years.

**Expected outcome.**  
Small RMSE gains, **large robustness gains** during extreme melt or freeze years.

**Datasets.**  
- NSIDC SIC/SIV products  
- ERA5 atmospheric forcings  
- Optional: CryoSat-2 / SMOS SIT (limited coverage)

**Tools.**  
- PyTorch Geometric or DGL  
- xarray, cartopy for geospatial handling

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| GNN underperforms CNN | Rejection | Focus analysis on regimes where it wins |
| Graph construction arbitrary | Reviewer skepticism | Strong ablations, physical motivation |
| Data sparsity (SIT) | Weak results | Position SIT as optional extension |
| Too incremental | Desk reject | Emphasize dynamic/Lagrangian graph novelty |

## 6. Stretch ideas / follow-up

- Coupling GNN with **sea-ice rheology solvers** as hybrid surrogate models  
- Graph diffusion models for probabilistic forecasting  
- Transfer to Antarctic sea ice without retraining

---

**Evidence note.**  
There is **very limited prior work explicitly using GNNs for sea ice**, which is good for novelty but risky. Most related work uses CNNs or physics-informed networks (e.g., Koo & Rahnemoonfar, 2023–2025 on arXiv). You should position this as *structure-aware ML*, not just “another deep model.”

**Optional next step:**  
Decide **static vs dynamic graph** as the core contribution—trying to sell both equally will dilute the paper.
