User is experienced, wants a concrete, constrained plan. Key is to center low-bandwidth realities (offline, SMS, compressed media) and avoid generic “multimodal detection.” Lead with assessment and deliver a tight plan. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
This is publishable **only if low-bandwidth constraints drive the methods** (offline-first, compressed signals, partial modalities). A standard multimodal detector evaluated on Twitter-scale data will be dismissed. The plan below treats *bandwidth, intermittency, and modality loss* as first-class variables.

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
Misinformation spreads rapidly in low-bandwidth regions via **compressed images, short videos, audio notes, and text fragments** (often forwarded across platforms). Most multimodal detectors assume reliable connectivity, full-resolution media, and centralized inference.

**Goal.**  
Design and evaluate a **resource-constrained multimodal misinformation detection pipeline** that operates under:
- intermittent connectivity,
- aggressive media compression,
- partial or missing modalities.

**Concrete objective.**  
Show that **bandwidth-aware representations and decision policies** achieve robust detection with minimal data transfer and compute.

**Scope.**  
Detection and triage (flagging/priority), not content removal or fact adjudication.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Bandwidth–accuracy tradeoff under compression

**Hypothesis.**  
Carefully chosen low-dimensional multimodal features preserve most detection signal under severe compression.

**Setup.**  
- Inputs: text snippets, compressed images (thumbnails), low-bitrate audio fingerprints.  
- Train lightweight multimodal models on progressively compressed inputs.

**Baselines.**  
- Full-resolution multimodal models (upper bound)  
- Text-only detectors

**Evaluation metrics.**  
F1/AUC vs transmitted bytes, latency.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Graceful degradation curves; identification of “sweet spots” in bytes vs accuracy.

---

### Experiment 2: Partial-modality and offline robustness

**Hypothesis.**  
Models trained with modality dropout outperform naive multimodal fusion when inputs are missing.

**Setup.**  
- Randomly drop modalities during training and testing.  
- Simulate offline inference with delayed sync.

**Baselines.**  
- Always-on multimodal fusion  
- Single-modality models

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Worst-case accuracy, variance across modality subsets.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Robust performance even when only one weak modality is present.

---

### Experiment 3: Edge-first triage vs centralized verification

**Hypothesis.**  
Edge-first triage (flagging likely misinformation locally) reduces bandwidth without increasing false negatives.

**Setup.**  
- Two-stage system: local lightweight filter → optional server-side verification.  
- Measure how often content needs upload.

**Baselines.**  
- Upload-all centralized detection  
- Fully local detection

**Evaluation metrics.**  
False negative rate, bytes uploaded per item, time-to-flag.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Order-of-magnitude bandwidth reduction with comparable safety.

## 3. Timeline (6 months)

**Month 1:**  
Define misinformation categories and low-bandwidth constraints; dataset selection.

**Month 2:**  
Implement compression pipelines and text/audio/image baselines.

**Month 3:**  
Multimodal models with bandwidth-aware features (Experiment 1).

**Month 4:**  
Modality dropout and offline simulations (Experiment 2).

**Month 5:**  
Edge–centralized triage experiments (Experiment 3).

**Month 6:**  
Analysis, ablations, writing, and artifact packaging.

## 4. Resources

**Compute.**  
- CPU or single modest GPU; emphasis on inference efficiency.

**Tools.**  
- PyTorch  
- Lightweight audio/image processing libraries  
- Emulation tools for network constraints

**Datasets.**  
- Public multimodal misinformation datasets (used as sources, aggressively downsampled).  
**Evidence note:** There is limited publicly available data reflecting *true* low-bandwidth forwarding behavior. To strengthen claims, log realistic compression and forwarding patterns from field reports or NGO partners.

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Unrealistic data | Reviewer skepticism | Simulate real compression/noise |
| Ethical concerns | Pushback | Focus on triage, not censorship |
| Weak multimodal gains | Null results | Emphasize bandwidth savings |
| Overgeneralization | Rejection | Scope claims to constraints |

## 6. Stretch ideas / follow-up directions

- Community-in-the-loop verification workflows  
- Cross-lingual low-resource extensions  
- Adversarial robustness under meme evolution

---

**Bottom line:**  
This project works if you **optimize for bytes, not benchmarks**.

**Optional next step:**  
Write a one-page **bandwidth budget** (bytes per message, per day) and force every design choice to justify itself against it.
