User is experienced. Topic is good but risky: “fairness-aware recommender” often collapses into vague metrics disconnected from merchant outcomes. Need to anchor fairness to small-store constraints and business viability. No tools needed. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
This is publishable **only if fairness is defined relative to small-store realities** (sparse data, thin margins, supplier diversity), not generic demographic parity on users. If you don’t tie fairness metrics to **merchant survival and customer utility**, reviewers will call it performative. The plan below hard-binds fairness to outcomes small e‑commerce stores actually care about.

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
Recommendation systems used by small e‑commerce stores in emerging markets often:
- amplify popularity bias,
- disadvantage new or local sellers,
- rely on user/item signals that are extremely sparse.

Fairness-aware algorithms exist, but they are evaluated on **large-platform assumptions** and rarely tested under small-store constraints.

**Goal.**  
Evaluate **fairness-aware recommendation algorithms** under **small-store, emerging-market conditions**, quantifying trade-offs between:
- seller fairness (exposure, opportunity),
- consumer utility,
- store-level revenue viability.

**Fairness scope (explicit).**  
- **Seller-side fairness** (primary): exposure parity across seller groups (e.g., local vs large suppliers, new vs established).  
- **User-side fairness** (secondary): performance consistency across low-activity vs high-activity users.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Popularity bias and seller exposure imbalance

**Hypothesis.**  
Standard recommenders significantly disadvantage small or new sellers; fairness-aware re-ranking can correct this with limited revenue loss.

**Setup.**  
- Simulate small-store catalogs with long-tail seller distributions.  
- Compare base recommenders vs fairness-aware variants (e.g., exposure-constrained re-ranking).

**Baselines.**  
- Popularity-based recommender  
- Standard collaborative filtering

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Seller exposure Gini coefficient, long-tail coverage, CTR / revenue proxy.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Baseline systems show extreme exposure skew; fairness-aware methods reduce skew with modest utility loss.

---

### Experiment 2: Data sparsity stress test (emerging-market realism)

**Hypothesis.**  
Many fairness-aware methods break down under sparse interaction data typical of small stores.

**Setup.**  
- Artificially downsample interactions to simulate low-traffic conditions.  
- Measure stability of fairness and utility metrics.

**Baselines.**  
- Same algorithms under dense-data conditions  
- Heuristic diversity re-ranking

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Metric variance, fairness collapse thresholds, cold-start seller exposure.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Identification of methods that are brittle vs robust to sparsity.

---

### Experiment 3: Business viability trade-off analysis

**Hypothesis.**  
Some fairness interventions harm small-store revenue enough to be impractical.

**Setup.**  
- Use simple demand/revenue models to approximate store outcomes.  
- Compare fairness–revenue Pareto fronts.

**Baselines.**  
- Revenue-only optimization  
- Uniform exposure allocation

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Revenue delta, fairness gain per revenue unit, worst-case seller loss.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Clear separation between “theoretically fair” and **operationally viable** methods.

---

### Experiment 4: User heterogeneity and perceived fairness

**Hypothesis.**  
Fairness-aware recommendations affect low-activity users differently than power users.

**Setup.**  
- Segment users by activity level.  
- Measure recommendation quality and diversity per segment.

**Baselines.**  
- One-size-fits-all recommender  
- Personalized-only optimization

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Segmented NDCG, diversity, satisfaction proxy.

**Expected outcomes.**  
Evidence that fairness mechanisms interact nontrivially with user heterogeneity.

## 3. Timeline (6 months)

**Month 1:**  
Define fairness metrics tied to seller viability; dataset selection or simulation design.

**Month 2:**  
Baseline recommender implementation and validation.

**Month 3:**  
Fairness-aware algorithms + Experiment 1.

**Month 4:**  
Sparsity stress tests (Experiment 2).

**Month 5:**  
Business trade-off modeling (Experiment 3–4).

**Month 6:**  
Synthesis, ablations, paper writing, artifact release.

## 4. Resources

**Compute.**  
- CPU or single modest GPU; recommender training is lightweight.

**Tools.**  
- Python, standard recommender libraries  
- Simple simulation frameworks

**Datasets.**  
- Public e‑commerce or marketplace datasets (subsampled to small-store scale)  
- Synthetic catalogs calibrated to real distributions

**Evidence note.**  
Public datasets rarely represent *true* small-store dynamics in emerging markets. Be explicit about simulation assumptions and provide sensitivity analyses rather than forcing weak real-world claims.

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Fairness definition contested | Reviewer pushback | Tie metrics to seller outcomes |
| Synthetic data skepticism | Credibility loss | Stress-test assumptions |
| Revenue harm | Practical irrelevance | Pareto analysis, not absolutes |
| Overgeneralization | Rejection | Narrow market scope |

---

## 6. Stretch ideas or follow-up directions

- Seller-controlled fairness knobs  
- Regulatory alignment for SME protection  
- Field pilots with small platforms or cooperatives

---

**Bottom line:**  
This work matters only if it shows **which fairness ideas small stores can actually afford**.

**Optional next step:**  
Write a one-page **fairness–revenue contract** stating what level of revenue loss is acceptable for a small merchant—and enforce it throughout the study.
