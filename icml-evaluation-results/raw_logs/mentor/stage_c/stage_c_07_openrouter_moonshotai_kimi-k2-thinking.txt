User is asking for a concrete applied research plan. This is feasible and well-scoped. Key risk: turning this into vague “AI for good.” Need to anchor on low-power constraints, diver workflow, and publishable contribution (algorithm + system + field realism). No need to ask context. </thinking>

**Blunt assessment:**  
This is a strong idea **if** you treat power, deployment, and annotation noise as first‑class research variables. A generic coral classifier trained on clean datasets will not be publishable. What *will* work is a **resource‑constrained, human‑in‑the‑loop vision system** evaluated under real diver conditions.

## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Problem.**  
Coral reef monitoring relies on expert surveys that are sparse, expensive, and geographically limited. Volunteer divers collect abundant imagery, but:
- devices are low‑power,
- images are noisy (motion, lighting, turbidity),
- labels are weak or inconsistent.

**Goal.**  
Develop and evaluate **low‑power computer vision tools** that enable *non‑expert volunteer divers* to collect useful reef health data with **minimal battery, compute, and annotation burden**.

**Core research claim.**  
Carefully co‑designed models + workflows can produce **scientifically useful reef health indicators** under extreme power and data constraints.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Low-power reef health classification under realistic noise

**Hypothesis.**  
Lightweight vision models, trained with noise‑robust objectives, can reliably estimate coarse reef health indicators from diver imagery.

**Setup.**  
- Tasks: coral vs algae cover, bleaching presence, structural complexity proxy.  
- Models: MobileNet‑class CNNs or tiny ViTs.  
- Training with heavy augmentations (color shift, blur, motion artifacts).

**Baselines.**  
- Larger CNNs (upper bound, offline only)  
- Simple color/texture heuristics

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Accuracy/F1, calibration, robustness under simulated underwater noise.

**Expected outcome.**  
Small models achieve acceptable accuracy with far lower energy cost.

### Experiment 2: On-device vs deferred inference tradeoff

**Hypothesis.**  
Partial on‑device processing (e.g., frame filtering, region selection) reduces power usage without hurting downstream accuracy.

**Setup.**  
- Compare: full on‑device inference vs frame selection + later processing.  
- Measure battery drain on representative devices.

**Baselines.**  
- Always-on inference  
- Upload-all raw video

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Energy per useful prediction, recall of ecologically relevant frames.

**Expected outcome.**  
Hybrid pipelines dominate both extremes.

---

### Experiment 3: Volunteer annotation noise and human–AI collaboration

**Hypothesis.**  
Simple AI assistance improves volunteer label quality more than training volunteers harder.

**Setup.**  
- Volunteers label imagery with and without AI suggestions.  
- Measure agreement with expert annotations.

**Baselines.**  
- Volunteer-only labels  
- Expert-only labels (upper bound)

**Evaluation metrics.**  
Inter-annotator agreement, label correction rate, time per annotation.

**Expected outcome.**  
AI-assisted volunteers approach expert reliability at lower cost.

## 3. Timeline (6 months)

**Month 1:**  
Dataset assembly (existing reef imagery), define health indicators.

**Month 2:**  
Train lightweight baselines; underwater noise modeling.

**Month 3:**  
Energy profiling and on-device pipeline experiments.

**Month 4:**  
Human–AI annotation study with volunteers.

**Month 5:**  
Integrated analysis: accuracy vs energy vs label quality.

**Month 6:**  
Paper writing, system diagrams, ecological validation narrative.

---

## 4. Resources

**Compute.**  
- Modest GPU for training; phones or SBCs (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for deployment tests.

**Tools.**  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow Lite  
- On-device profiling tools  
- Annotation platforms

**Datasets.**  
- Public coral reef image datasets (used as starting point)  
- Volunteer-collected imagery (even small-scale)

**Evidence note.**  
There is extensive ecological literature on coral monitoring, but **limited ML work evaluated under diver-grade hardware and workflows**. If reviewers ask for ecological grounding, partner with a marine science lab or cite expert labeling protocols rather than ML benchmarks.

## 5. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Poor image quality | Model failure | Train explicitly on degraded data |
| Volunteer inconsistency | Noisy labels | Focus on coarse indicators |
| Weak novelty | Rejection | Emphasize energy + human-in-loop |
| Ecological skepticism | Pushback | Validate with expert review |

---

## 6. Stretch ideas / follow-up directions

- Active learning to guide what divers record  
- Temporal change detection across dives  
- Integration with low-cost underwater drones

---

**Bottom line:**  
This succeeds if you frame it as **systems + constraints + humans**, not “we trained a coral classifier.”

**Optional next step:**  
Pick **one reef health indicator** (e.g., bleaching detection) and design everything around measuring it well under power limits.
