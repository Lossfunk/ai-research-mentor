Experienced user, near submission. They want concrete venue mapping and an adapted plan. Risk: too many venues—pick the realistic ones for this paper type. I’ll map MLSys, NeurIPS, ICLR, EMNLP and then tell them which to prioritize and how to adapt.

**Bottom line:** your paper fits **MLSys or ICLR** best. NeurIPS main track is risky unless the transfer insight is very sharp. EMNLP only makes sense if datasets/tasks are clearly NLP‑centric. Below is the *actionable* mapping and how you should adapt.

---

## Venue-specific expectations (what actually gets you rejected)

### **MLSys**
- **Pages:** 10 pages main (+ unlimited refs)
- **Anonymization:** Double‑blind, strict
- **Artifacts:** *Strong expectation* of code + scripts; artifact eval is real
- **Reviewer bias:** cares about *experimental discipline* and cost
- **Adaptation:**  
  - Add a compute-cost vs transfer-gain plot  
  - Make bag construction and transfer protocol painfully explicit  
  - Plan public code at submission (or very shortly after)

**Best fit if your conclusion is “transfer is unreliable / costly.”**

---

### **ICLR**
- **Pages:** ~9 pages (flexible appendix)
- **Anonymization:** Double‑blind
- **Artifacts:** Encouraged, not mandatory, but expected for empirical work
- **Ethics:** Required ethics & limitations section
- **Reviewer bias:** wants a *conceptual takeaway*, not just measurements
- **Adaptation:**  
  - Frame results around *why* MIL representations fail/succeed to transfer  
  - Add one synthetic or controlled experiment to isolate mechanism  
  - Ethics section must mention negative transfer risks

**Viable if you elevate beyond “benchmark comparison.”**

---

### **NeurIPS (main track)**
- **Pages:** 9 pages strict
- **Anonymization:** Double‑blind
- **Artifacts:** Optional but reviewers expect reproducibility
- **Ethics:** Mandatory impact statement
- **Reviewer bias:** hostile to “does X transfer?” unless answer changes beliefs
- **Adaptation (if you insist):**  
  - Collapse results to a single, strong claim  
  - Cut datasets aggressively  
  - Explicitly argue why prior transfer results don’t apply to MIL

**High reject risk for this paper type.**

---

### **EMNLP**
- **Pages:** 8 long / 4 short
- **Anonymization:** Double‑blind
- **Artifacts:** Strong expectation for code + data statements
- **Ethics:** Dataset documentation and limitations required
- **Reviewer bias:** NLP relevance must be obvious
- **Adaptation:**  
  - Emphasize text‑based MIL (documents, conversations)  
  - Drop non‑NLP datasets or move them to appendix

**Only submit if MIL tasks are clearly NLP.**

---

## Recommended plan (adapted)

- **Primary target:** MLSys **or** ICLR (pick one, don’t hedge)
- **Code:** prepare a clean, minimal release now; don’t promise later
- **Compute disclosure:** include GPU hours and tuning budget explicitly
- **Claim tightening:** lead with *failure modes of transfer*, not averages

If you tell me which venue you’re leaning toward, I’ll rewrite your abstract to match reviewer expectations for that venue.
