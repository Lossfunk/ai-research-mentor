User seems experienced: asks about venues, timelines, ethics/formatting, wants reviewer simulation. My take: 6‑month compressible LLMs is borderline for top-tier unless scoped tightly; better aim workshops/short papers + one solid venue. Need to be honest about risk. No tools needed.

**Blunt assessment:** a 6‑month project on compressible LLMs is *unlikely* to land a full paper at the very top venues unless the contribution is narrowly scoped and empirically clean. You should target **short-paper or systems‑friendly venues**, plus workshops. Trying for NeurIPS/ICLR main track would be a low‑probability gamble.

### Best‑fit venues (ranked by realism)

**1. MLSys (main or short paper)**  
Strong fit if your contribution is *systems-level* (compression–latency–throughput tradeoffs).  
- **Formatting:** 10 pages + refs (main); strict reproducibility checklist  
- **Ethics:** low, but must disclose energy/efficiency claims honestly  
- **Reviewer bias:** hates vague “we compress and it’s smaller” stories

**2. NeurIPS / ICLR (short paper or workshop)**  
Only viable if you have a **clear theoretical or scaling insight**, not just an engineering trick.  
- **Formatting:** ~9 pages (ICLR), strict anonymization  
- **Ethics:** mandatory impact statement; reviewers skeptical of benchmark-only wins

**3. EMNLP (short paper)**  
Good if compression targets **deployment for NLP tasks** rather than general LLM scaling.  
- **Formatting:** 4–6 pages short paper  
- **Ethics:** explicit limitations + dataset bias statements

**4. COLM or Compression/Edge workshops (NeurIPS/ICLR)**  
High acceptance probability; good visibility if framed well.

### Simulated reviewer summary (MLSys-style)

> **Summary:** The paper presents a practical compression pipeline for LLMs achieving 1.8–2.2× memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss. The experimental evaluation is solid and reproducible.  
> **Strengths:** Clear systems motivation; realistic hardware benchmarks; ablations are convincing.  
> **Weaknesses:** Limited novelty—methods combine known quantization and pruning techniques. Lacks a unifying insight explaining *when* the approach should work.  
> **Recommendation:** Weak accept as a short paper if claims are tightened; otherwise reject for incrementalism.

**Direction:** pick *one* core insight (e.g., compression–KV cache interaction or fine‑tuning stability) and beat it to death experimentally. That’s how this becomes publishable in 6 months.
