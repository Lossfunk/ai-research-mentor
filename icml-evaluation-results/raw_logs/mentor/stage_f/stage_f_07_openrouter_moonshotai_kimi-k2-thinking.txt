**Simulated Reviewer Summary (Rebuttal‑style)**

**Summary:**  
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of federated learning (FL) methods across multiple datasets and system settings. The evaluation is broader than most prior work and exposes meaningful performance–communication tradeoffs.

**Major strengths:**  
- The benchmark scope is genuinely useful: multiple datasets, heterogeneous clients, and standardized metrics.  
- Experimental hygiene is mostly solid (fixed rounds, comparable budgets), which makes cross‑method comparisons credible.  
- The paper surfaces failure modes (instability under heterogeneity) rather than only headline gains, which is valuable for the community.

**Major concerns:**  
- Novelty is limited to aggregation and evaluation; no new FL algorithmic insight is offered. Reviewers may question whether this is a benchmark paper or a systems paper, and it currently sits awkwardly between the two.  
- Some comparisons feel underpowered: hyperparameter tuning budgets and client sampling strategies differ subtly across methods, potentially confounding results.  
- Claims about “practical relevance” are overstated given the absence of real‑world non‑IID traces or system noise beyond synthetic heterogeneity.

**Missing or weak artifacts:**  
- No runnable benchmark harness is provided; without code, reproducibility is questionable for a benchmark paper.  
- Dataset preprocessing and client partitioning scripts are not specified in sufficient detail.  
- Compute and communication cost reporting is incomplete (wall‑clock, bandwidth assumptions).

**Recommendation:** Borderline accept if artifacts are released and claims are tightened; otherwise, reject for limited contribution beyond aggregation.
