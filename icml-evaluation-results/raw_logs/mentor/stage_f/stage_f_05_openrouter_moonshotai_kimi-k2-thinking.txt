Experienced researcher, close to submission. They want execution, not ideas. Risk: checklist bloat. I’ll keep it ruthless, venue-agnostic (NeurIPS/ICLR/EMNLP‑style), with short sections and a tight 6‑week timeline.

**Assessment:** Privacy‑preserving NLP papers most often fail on **hand‑wavy threat models**, **missing artifact plans**, or **ethics sections that say nothing concrete**. This checklist targets exactly those.

## Final Submission Checklist (privacy‑preserving NLP)

### Artifacts (reviewers will check)
- **Code:** runnable training/eval scripts with privacy mechanism on/off toggles  
- **Data:** clear statement of what is *not* released and why (privacy ≠ secrecy)  
- **Reproducibility note:** hardware, seeds, and privacy parameters (ε, δ, noise scale)

### Ethics & compliance (don’t undersell)
- **Threat model:** who the adversary is *and is not* (membership inference, reconstruction, etc.)  
- **Privacy limits:** explicit statement of what your method does *not* protect against  
- **Human data:** dataset provenance, consent status, and residual risk after protection

### Claims & reporting (high‑risk area)
- **Utility–privacy tradeoff:** same metric, same split, same tuning budget  
- **Baselines:** non‑private and naïve private baselines included  
- **Compute disclosure:** total runs × model size × privacy overhead

## 6‑Week Timeline (hard gates)

**T‑6 to T‑4 weeks (lock science)**  
Freeze methods and datasets. If ε or threat model changes after this, reviewers will notice.

**T‑4 to T‑2 weeks (write + audit)**  
Write ethics and limitations *before* polishing results. Prepare artifact README now.

**T‑2 weeks to deadline (defensive polish)**  
Anonymization, license check, artifact sanity run on a clean machine.

## Common missing items (fix now)
- Stating ε without interpreting what it means in practice  
- Claiming “privacy‑preserving” without a concrete attack evaluation  
- Promising code “after acceptance” with no artifact plan

If you tell me the target venue, I’ll tune this checklist to its exact ethics form and artifact expectations.
