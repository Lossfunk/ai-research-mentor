User is experienced and wants a slide outline. Keep it conference-ready, concise, opinionated. Highlight contributions, limitations, future work. Avoid long lists—keep tight sections with slide titles and key bullets.

**Assessment:** Trustworthy‑LLM evaluation talks fail when they oversell metrics and bury limitations. Your slides should *lead* with what evaluators get wrong and what your work fixes, then clearly state what it still cannot do.

## Conference‑Ready Slide Outline (12–14 slides)

### 1. Title & Motivation
- Trustworthiness claims outpace evaluation quality  
- Current benchmarks miss real failure modes

### 2. Problem Statement
- What “trustworthy” means operationally (and what it doesn’t)
- Why existing evaluations are insufficient

### 3. Key Insight
- One sentence: *the core evaluation gap you expose*
- Why this matters for deployment decisions

### 4. Contributions
- New evaluation protocol / benchmark  
- Empirical findings that contradict common assumptions  
- Practical guidance for model assessment

### 5. Related Work (Selective)
- What prior evaluations measure well  
- What they systematically miss

### 6. Evaluation Setup
- Models, tasks, threat models  
- What is held constant vs varied

### 7. Main Results
- One flagship figure/table  
- Clear takeaway, not averages

### 8. Failure Modes Discovered
- Concrete examples of untrustworthy behavior
- Why standard metrics would not catch them

### 9. Robustness & Sensitivity
- How results change with prompts, seeds, or model size
- Where conclusions break

### 10. Limitations (Explicit)
- Aspects of trustworthiness not covered  
- Dataset or task biases  
- What should *not* be inferred from results

### 11. Implications
- For benchmark designers  
- For practitioners deploying LLMs  
- For policy or audit contexts (if applicable)

### 12. Future Work
- Evaluation dimensions to add next  
- Human‑in‑the‑loop or longitudinal evaluation  
- Stress‑testing under real deployment constraints

### 13. Take‑Home Message
- One clear sentence reviewers should remember

### 14. Backup / Appendix
- Additional results, ablations, or definitions

**Direction:** If you want, tell me the target venue and talk length (10 vs 15 min). I’ll tighten this into a slide‑by‑slide script with timing and figure guidance.
