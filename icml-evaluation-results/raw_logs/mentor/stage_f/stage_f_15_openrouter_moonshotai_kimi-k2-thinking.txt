Experienced researcher, post‑acceptance trajectory. They want execution. Risk is overlong checklists; I’ll give a tight, sequential playbook with only what reviewers/editors actually enforce.

**Assessment:** Cross‑lingual dialogue papers stumble at **camera‑ready inconsistencies**, **data/licensing ambiguity**, and **missing disclosures about language coverage and annotators**. This playbook avoids that.

## Step‑by‑Step Publishing Playbook

### Step 1: Camera‑Ready Lock (Days 0–3)
- Freeze claims, figures, and tables; no metric drift from the accepted version.
- Re‑read the paper *only* for internal consistency: languages listed, dataset sizes, splits, and examples must match everywhere.
- Ensure all non‑English examples have translations and are consistently formatted.

### Step 2: Disclosure & Ethics Finalization (Days 2–4)
- **Language coverage statement:** which languages, scripts, and varieties are included—and which are not.
- **Data provenance:** sources, licenses, and whether dialogue data includes personal or sensitive content.
- **Human annotation disclosure:** annotator background, compensation, and language proficiency.
- **Limitations:** explicitly state generalization limits across languages and cultures.

### Step 3: Artifact & Archival Prep (Days 4–7)
- Package code with one reproducible command for a flagship result.
- Clearly separate:
  - redistributable data  
  - instructions for restricted or proprietary data
- Add a license table (code / models / datasets).
- Upload to the venue’s archival system (or Zenodo) with a DOI if allowed.

### Step 4: Final Compliance Check (Days 7–9)
- Verify formatting, reference completeness, and appendix links.
- Confirm anonymization is fully lifted *only where permitted*.
- Check that artifact links match camera‑ready metadata.

### Step 5: Post‑Publication Readiness (Optional but smart)
- Prepare a short README update and citation file.
- Decide a single contact channel for issues (don’t promise support you can’t give).

**Direction:** If you tell me the target venue (ACL/EMNLP/ICLR/etc.), I’ll tailor this to its exact disclosure forms and archival rules.
