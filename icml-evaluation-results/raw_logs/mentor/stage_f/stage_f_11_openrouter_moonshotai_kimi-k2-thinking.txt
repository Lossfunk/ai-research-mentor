Experienced researcher at release stage. Honest take: dissemination often fails due to vague licenses and noisy repos. Goal: concrete, minimal plan that won’t backfire. Keep it tight, opinionated, and actionable.

**Assessment:** Sustainable‑AI projects get credibility only if the release is **clean, legally unambiguous, and easy to reproduce**. Anything fuzzy around licenses or energy claims will undermine the work.

## Final Dissemination Plan

### Licensing (decide once, don’t hedge)
- **Code:** Apache‑2.0 (maximizes adoption; explicit patent grant)
- **Models:** Creative Commons BY‑NC 4.0 *or* Apache‑2.0 if weights are safe for commercial use
- **Datasets:** Original license preserved; if derived, add a clear “non‑redistributable” notice

State incompatibilities explicitly. Reviewers and users hate guessing.

---

### Repository & README Structure (keep it boring)
- **Top:** One‑paragraph project goal + sustainability claim (what is optimized, what is not)
- **Middle:** Exact reproduction command for *one* headline result, with expected energy/compute numbers
- **Bottom:** Limitations, failure modes, and license table (code / models / data)

No marketing language. Treat the README as a methods appendix.

---

### Release Mechanics
- Tag a **v1.0.0** release with frozen hashes for code and weights  
- Provide a **minimal environment spec** (one Conda or Docker path, not both)  
- Include a short **RELEASE_NOTES.md** describing changes and known issues

---

### Community & Stewardship
- **Issues:** enabled, but with a scope statement (bugs/repro only)
- **Discussions:** for energy benchmarks and hardware variance
- **Contact:** single maintainer email; no personal Slack/Discord promises

This signals seriousness without committing you to unpaid support.

---

### Sustainability Disclosure (don’t oversell)
- Report *measured* energy/compute savings, not projected ones  
- State the hardware and region assumptions clearly  
- Say where the approach does **not** reduce footprint

**Direction:** Finalize licenses first, then lock the README, then cut the release. If you want, paste your current README draft and license choices—I’ll tell you exactly where users or reviewers will get confused.
