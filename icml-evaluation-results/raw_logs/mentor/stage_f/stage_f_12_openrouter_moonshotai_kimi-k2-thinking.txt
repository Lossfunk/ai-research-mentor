Experienced researcher, near acceptance. They want paste-ready text. Be strict about anonymization and patient data. Provide two sections with bullets, not long lists.

**Assessment:** For medical imaging, reviewers care less about flashy interpretability and more about **patient privacy, provenance, and reproducibility**. Your notes must make it obvious you didn’t leak PHI and that artifacts are usable without privileged access.

## Artifact Release Notes (paste‑ready)

**Scope:**  
This release includes code for training, evaluation, and interpretability analyses, plus model checkpoints trained on approved datasets. **No raw patient images are redistributed.**

**Privacy & Anonymization:**  
- All datasets used are publicly available or accessed under approved data use agreements.  
- No protected health information (PHI) is included in the release.  
- Image identifiers, filenames, and metadata have been irreversibly anonymized.  
- Any visual examples are from public datasets or are fully de‑identified.

**Artifacts Provided:**  
- Training/evaluation scripts and interpretability methods  
- Pretrained model weights (trained only on compliant data)  
- Configuration files, seeds, and environment specification

**Artifacts Not Provided:**  
- Raw clinical images or institution‑specific data (due to patient privacy and license restrictions).  
Instructions to obtain the original datasets are included.

**Reproducibility:**  
A single command reproduces the main quantitative result using the released weights. Hardware and expected runtime are documented.

**Licensing:**  
Code is released under a permissive open‑source license. Model weights follow the most restrictive upstream dataset license where applicable.

## Reviewer Response Bullet Points (Rebuttal‑style)

- **Anonymization:** We confirm that all artifacts are fully anonymized; no PHI, site identifiers, or patient metadata are included.  
- **Patient Data Compliance:** The study uses only approved datasets; redistribution restrictions are explicitly respected and documented.  
- **Reproducibility Without Private Data:** While raw clinical data cannot be shared, all methods, configurations, and pretrained models are released to enable verification.  
- **Interpretability Claims:** Visualizations in the paper and artifacts are generated from compliant data only; no private examples are shown.  
- **Limitations:** We explicitly state that results may not generalize to unseen institutions or scanners and that interpretability does not imply clinical validity.

**Direction:** Before release, do a final audit: search the repo for filenames, paths, or comments that could hint at institutions or cohorts. If you want, paste your current release notes and I’ll red‑line any privacy leaks reviewers would flag.
