User is experienced and close to submission. They want execution help, not ideation. Risk: checklist could bloat—keep it tight and opinionated. Venue unspecified; assume NeurIPS/ICLR/MLSys‑adjacent and note where venue choice matters. Be explicit about likely weak points for a MIL transfer paper.

**Assessment:** Papers like *“Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?”* often fail on **ambiguity of transfer setting** and **underpowered baselines**. Your checklist should ruthlessly target those, not formatting trivia.

## Submission Checklist (opinionated)

### Core scientific checks (non‑negotiable)
- **Transfer definition is explicit**: what transfers (instance encoder, aggregation, both), across *which shift* (domain, label space, bag structure). If this isn’t formalized, reviewers will call it vague.
- **Baselines include non‑MIL transfer** (e.g., instance‑level or pooled models). Missing this is a common reject.
- **Negative results are surfaced**, not buried. This paper’s value *is* when transfer fails.

### Ethics & compliance
- **Dataset licenses**: explicitly state licenses for *each* MIL dataset (esp. medical or remote sensing—reviewers check this).
- **Human data**: if any medical/clinical MIL datasets are used, include IRB/source statements even if data is public.
- **Compute disclosure**: total GPU hours + model sizes. Transfer papers get scrutinized for hidden tuning cost.

### Reproducibility
- Fixed bag construction rules and seeds documented  
- Hyperparameter transfer protocol stated (retuned vs frozen)  
- Code release plan stated (even if after acceptance)

## Final timeline (realistic, 3–4 weeks)

**T‑21 days:**  
Lock experiments. No new datasets. Only reruns for variance or ablations reviewers will demand.

**T‑14 days:**  
Write limitations + ethics sections *before* polishing results. This exposes missing disclosures early.

**T‑7 days:**  
Internal adversarial review: ask “Would transfer skeptics be convinced?” If not, tighten claims.

**T‑2 days:**  
Formatting, anonymization, citation/license audit.

## Key risks (highest first)
1. **“Incremental survey paper” perception** — mitigate by a sharp takeaway: *when* MIL transfer breaks.
2. **Confounded transfer gains** due to bag size or label leakage.
3. **Underreporting compute**, triggering ethics/reproducibility objections.

## Likely missing items
- A failure case figure or table  
- Explicit non‑transfer baseline  
- Clear statement of practical implications (“Should practitioners reuse MIL models or not?”)
