Experienced researcher. Needs concrete, venue-specific execution. Robotics safety has real ethics/video pitfalls. I’ll cover ICRA, IROS, RSS, CoRL, then give a single adapted plan. Keep it tight.

**Assessment:** Robotics safety papers get rejected for **unclear risk framing**, **weak video evidence**, or **missing artifact discipline**. Your plan must be venue‑specific because expectations differ a lot.

## Venue‑specific submission plan

### **ICRA**
- **Pages:** 6 pages main (+ refs)
- **Video:** *Strongly expected*. 3–5 min, narrated, showing failures and safety interventions. No marketing cuts.
- **Artifacts:** Encouraged; code not mandatory but hurts if absent for safety claims.
- **Ethics:** Safety justification required; human/animal interaction must be explicitly approved.
- **Adaptation:** Lead video with a concrete hazard scenario and mitigation. Include a short “what can still go wrong” segment.

### **IROS**
- **Pages:** 6–8 pages
- **Video:** Optional but highly influential. Similar standards to ICRA.
- **Artifacts:** Optional; datasets/sim configs often sufficient.
- **Ethics:** Less formal than ICRA, but reviewers expect a risk discussion.
- **Adaptation:** Emphasize practical deployment constraints; show robustness, not novelty theater.

### **RSS**
- **Pages:** ~8 pages
- **Video:** *Mandatory* and scrutinized. Must demonstrate the core claim end‑to‑end.
- **Artifacts:** Strong expectation of code/sim environments.
- **Ethics:** Explicit discussion of failure modes and assumptions.
- **Adaptation:** Tighten the paper to one safety insight. The video is part of the argument—treat it like a figure.

### **CoRL**
- **Pages:** ~8 pages (+ appendix)
- **Video:** Expected; learning curves + real robot behavior.
- **Artifacts:** Strong expectation of code and training details.
- **Ethics:** Human data and real‑world risk statements required.
- **Adaptation:** Connect safety to learning dynamics; disclose data collection risks clearly.

## Artifact checklist (don’t skip)
- Reproducible simulation configs and seeds  
- Real‑robot calibration notes (even if not fully released)  
- Clear README stating *what is and is not safe to deploy*  
- Compute + hardware disclosure (robots, sensors, safeguards)

---

## Ethical review steps (before submission)
- Document hazard analysis (who/what can be harmed)  
- Approval statements for any human/animal exposure  
- Explicit limits: scenarios where the system should *not* be used  
- Video anonymization (faces, locations, lab identifiers)

## Recommendation
If the paper’s core evidence is **behavioral safety**, target **RSS or ICRA** and invest early in the video. If it’s **learning‑driven safety**, **CoRL** is the cleanest fit.

Tell me which venue you’re aiming for and whether you have real‑robot footage—I’ll tailor the video script and ethics language exactly to that venue.
