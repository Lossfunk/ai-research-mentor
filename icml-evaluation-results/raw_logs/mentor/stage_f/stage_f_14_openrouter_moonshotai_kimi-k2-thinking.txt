Experienced researcher. They want reviewer-facing risks and a mitigation checklist. I must be blunt, concise, and avoid long lists. I’ll give 3 major risks and a tight 3-item mitigation checklist tied to the submission package.

**Assessment:** Climate‑research AI papers are rejected less for weak models and more for **overclaiming impact**, **method–climate mismatch**, and **reproducibility gaps**. Reviewers are skeptical by default.

## Major reviewer-facing risks

**1) Overstated climate relevance**  
Reviewers will push back if the AI contribution doesn’t clearly change a climate conclusion (not just efficiency or accuracy). “Enables better climate understanding” without a concrete downstream implication is a red flag.

**2) Physical inconsistency or domain naivety**  
ML gains that violate conservation laws, ignore uncertainty, or bypass established baselines (e.g., reanalysis, physics-informed models) will be attacked hard—especially by domain reviewers.

**3) Weak reproducibility and data provenance**  
Climate data pipelines are messy. If preprocessing, temporal splits, or regridding choices aren’t crystal clear—or artifacts are partial—trust evaporates quickly.

## Mitigation checklist for the final submission package

**A) Claims & framing audit**  
- Rewrite the abstract and conclusion to state *exactly* what climate decision or analysis improves—and what does not.  
- Add one explicit non-claim (what your method should not be used for).

**B) Physics & baselines sanity check**  
- Include a short section or appendix verifying physical constraints or uncertainty behavior.  
- Compare against at least one domain-standard baseline and explain mismatches.

**C) Reproducibility & artifacts lock**  
- Provide a minimal, runnable artifact reproducing one headline result.  
- Document data sources, licenses, preprocessing, and temporal splits in one place.  
- Disclose compute, resolution, and geographic limits.

If you want, paste your abstract and artifact README—I’ll mark exactly where reviewers will say “this is overstated” or “this isn’t climate science.”
