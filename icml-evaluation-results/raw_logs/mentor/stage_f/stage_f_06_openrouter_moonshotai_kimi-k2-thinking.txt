Experienced user, near submission. They want concrete wording for double‑blind compliance, artifacts, anonymized appendices. Lead with assessment: reviewers often flag leaks. Provide ready-to-paste text blocks. Keep concise.

**Assessment:** Double‑blind failures are a top desk‑reject cause for human‑centered AI papers. Your notes must show *intentional anonymization*, not just “we removed names,” and a credible artifact plan that doesn’t leak identity.

Below are **ready‑to‑paste compliance notes** you can adapt.

---

### Double‑Blind Compliance Statement
> This submission is fully anonymized. All author identifiers, institutional affiliations, URLs, and acknowledgments have been removed. Self‑citations are written in the third person and limited to what is necessary for context. No proprietary tools, internal datasets, or institution‑specific infrastructure are referenced in the main text or appendices.

### Human Subjects & Ethics (Anonymized)
> The study involves human participants. Ethical approval was obtained from an institutional review process; identifying details are withheld for double‑blind review. Participants provided informed consent. Demographic reporting is aggregated to prevent re‑identification.

### Artifact Release Plan (Blind‑Safe)
> To preserve anonymity, artifacts are **not publicly linked** at submission. Upon acceptance, we will release code, analysis scripts, and de‑identified data via a public repository. A temporary, access‑controlled archive will be provided to reviewers upon request through the conference artifact system.

### Anonymized Appendices
> Appendices include task materials, survey instruments, and analysis details with all branding, institution‑specific language, and metadata removed. Screenshots and interfaces are redacted to avoid revealing deployment context.

### Limitations (Identity‑Neutral)
> Limitations are discussed without referencing author expertise, prior deployments, or institutional settings.

**Direction:** Before submission, do a cold read and ask: “Could a reviewer infer who we are or where this ran?” If yes, redact again.
