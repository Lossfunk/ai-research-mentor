They want a compliance check, but provided no paper. I can’t evaluate without at least methods/data sections. Need to ask for materials and scope. Keep concise and directive.

I can’t check ethics or compliance without seeing the paper. Right now this is underspecified.

**What I need (minimum):**
- The **methods section** (or full draft if available)
- A list of **datasets** used (names + sources)
- Whether you trained, fine‑tuned, or only evaluated LLMs
- Approximate **compute** (GPUs × days) and model sizes

Paste the text or upload the PDF, and tell me **which venue you’re targeting** (MLSys, NeurIPS, EMNLP, etc.). Different venues have different disclosure landmines.

Once I have it, I’ll do a hard pass and flag:
- License violations or missing attributions
- Human‑data or scraped‑data risks reviewers will catch
- Incomplete compute/energy disclosures
- Missing ethics/limitations statements that trigger desk reject

Send the draft when ready.
