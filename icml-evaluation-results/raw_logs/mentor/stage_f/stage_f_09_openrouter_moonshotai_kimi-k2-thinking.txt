Experienced, camera-ready stage. Need execution, not ideas. Risk: bloated checklist. I’ll give a tight 2‑week sprint with concrete deliverables, artifact/licensing specifics, and a release note template.

**Assessment:** Camera‑ready failures usually come from **artifact sloppiness**, **license ambiguity**, or **last‑minute figure/text drift**. This sprint locks those down.

## Two‑Week Camera‑Ready Sprint (Graph Foundation Models)

**Days 1–2 (Freeze science)**
- Lock figures/tables and claims; no new experiments.
- Verify all graphs/tasks referenced have artifacts or are explicitly excluded.

**Days 3–4 (Artifact packaging)**
- Repo structure fixed (`/models`, `/data`, `/scripts`, `/configs`).
- Single command to reproduce *one* flagship result.
- Environment spec (conda/requirements + CUDA note).
- Deterministic seeds documented.

**Days 5–6 (Licensing & compliance)**
- Code license chosen (Apache‑2.0 preferred for GFM adoption).
- Dataset licenses enumerated; add “not redistributed” notes where required.
- Model weights license explicit and compatible with code license.
- Third‑party deps audited.

**Days 7–8 (Docs & release notes)**
- README: scope, supported tasks, hardware, known failure modes.
- RELEASE_NOTES.md (see template below).
- CITATION.cff updated.

**Days 9–10 (Camera‑ready polish)**
- Final formatting, references, appendix cross‑checks.
- Ethics/limitations align exactly with released artifacts.

**Days 11–14 (Dry run & buffer)**
- Clean‑machine run of artifact.
- Tag release; prep post‑acceptance announcement.

## Release Notes (paste-ready)
- **What’s new:** Graph FM checkpoints + eval scripts  
- **Reproducibility:** Command, seed, expected metrics  
- **Licensing:** Code X, weights Y, datasets Z (restrictions)  
- **Limitations:** Tasks not supported; scaling caveats  
- **Contact:** anonymized at submission; public post‑acceptance

If you want, tell me the target venue and I’ll tune artifact expectations (badge criteria, supplemental limits) exactly to that track.
