Working professional, time-constrained. Need realism and scoping. Lead with assessment: nights ≠ deep research; need tight loop. Give one concrete strategy, not many. 150–220 words.

Here’s the hard truth: **late‑night research only works if the scope is brutally small**. If you treat it like a second full‑time job, you’ll quit in a month.

Your first steps should aim for **short, closed loops**, not “doing research.” The right unit of progress is something you can finish in 1–2 nights.

The most reliable starting point is this:  
**pick one narrow ML task with an existing codebase and try to answer one concrete empirical question**. Not “improve the model”—something like “does this method still work if I change X?” You’re training research judgment, not chasing novelty.

Why this works at night:
- You can pause and resume without losing context
- You get feedback quickly (plots, failures, bugs)
- You avoid the cognitive overhead of open‑ended theory

What will fail with your schedule:
- Reading papers without running anything
- Long theoretical detours
- Large datasets or long training jobs

Set a rule: if a task can’t show progress in **two evenings**, it’s too big.

One thing I need to scope this properly:  
**What’s your background—strong coder, analyst, or neither?** That determines whether your first loop should be implementation‑heavy or analysis‑heavy.
