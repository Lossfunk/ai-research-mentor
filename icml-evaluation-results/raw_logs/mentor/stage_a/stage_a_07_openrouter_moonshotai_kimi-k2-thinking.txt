First, reset expectations: **as a high‑school student, “AI research” means learning how research works, not producing novel results**. That’s okay. Doing this responsibly means not overclaiming and not building things you don’t understand.

A responsible way to explore is **guided replication**:
- Take a well-known beginner ML project with open code.
- Run it, change *one* thing (data size, noise, evaluation metric), and observe what breaks.
- Write a short, honest report about what you tried and what you *don’t* understand yet.

This teaches real research habits: skepticism, documentation, and limits.

What you should avoid:
- Training huge models you don’t understand
- Making claims about ethics, safety, or societal impact without evidence
- Posting flashy demos and calling them “research”

Free resources are enough if you focus:
- One intro ML course
- One open dataset
- One simple model

If you finish with clearer questions than when you started, you did it right.

To guide you properly: **do you enjoy coding more, or reading and explaining ideas?** That choice determines your best entry point—and keeps this safe and honest.
