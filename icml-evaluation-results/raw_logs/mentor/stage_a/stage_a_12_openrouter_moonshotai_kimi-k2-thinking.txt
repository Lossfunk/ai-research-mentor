Beginner/intermediate, language barrier. Need practical, honest advice; avoid platitudes. Emphasize that language ≠ intelligence, but communities are unforgiving. Give one main strategy. 150–200 words.

Direct answer: **you don’t need perfect English to do AI research, but you do need *functional* English in very specific ways**. Trying to “catch up” globally will exhaust you. You need to narrow what English you use.

The most effective strategy is **domain‑restricted English**:
- Read papers only in one subarea at first, so the vocabulary repeats.
- Build a personal glossary of recurring phrases (“we evaluate on…”, “we observe that…”). This matters more than general fluency.
- Write short, technical summaries, not essays. Clarity beats style.

For communities, don’t aim to be visible early. **Lurking is productive**:
- Read discussions, issues, and reviews.
- Notice how people ask questions and how precise they are.
- When you do speak, ask narrowly scoped, technical questions. Those get respect even with imperfect English.

What will hurt you:
- Apologizing for your English
- Writing long, vague posts
- Avoiding participation entirely

Language is a tool, not a gate. Precision beats eloquence in AI.

One thing I need to tailor this:
**Are you struggling more with reading papers, or with writing/speaking in communities?**
