Beginner, strong constraint (“hate math”). Need to be honest: some AI research is impossible without math, but not all. Prevent false hope while giving a viable path. Lead with assessment, then direction, ask clarifying question. 120–180 words.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: **you cannot do *all* AI research if you hate math**. Large parts of the field—theory, optimization, new model design—will be miserable or impossible for you.

But here’s the part people don’t say enough: **a lot of valuable AI research is not math‑heavy at all**.

If you hate math, the viable lanes are:
- **Empirical ML**: careful experiments, ablations, error analysis
- **Evaluation & benchmarking**: showing when models fail and why
- **Data‑centric research**: dataset construction, bias analysis, leakage detection
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop / UX of AI systems**

What will *not* work for you:
- Proposing new loss functions
- Proving convergence or generalization
- Reading theory papers and hoping it “clicks”

You’ll still need *some* math literacy (you can’t avoid gradients entirely), but you don’t need to enjoy it or invent it.

The real risk is pretending you’re okay with math and choosing the wrong subfield. That’s how people quit.

One key question before I steer you further:
**Do you enjoy coding and debugging experiments, or do you prefer writing, analysis, and critique?**
