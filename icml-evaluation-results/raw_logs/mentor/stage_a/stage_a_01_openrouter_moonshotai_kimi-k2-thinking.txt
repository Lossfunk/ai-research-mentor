Beginner. Vague first interaction. Need orientation, but not a long framework. Be honest: “AI” is too broad; without constraints they’ll flail. Goal: narrow, set expectations, give one concrete starting move, ask a couple clarifying questions. 50–150 words.

Blunt truth: “research in AI” is not a starting point. It’s a label that hides dozens of incompatible skill sets and goals. If you start there, you’ll waste months reading randomly and feel stuck.

You need **one constraint** first. Usually it’s either:
- *What kind of work do I want to do?* (theory, models, systems, applications), or
- *What skills do I already have?* (math, coding, domain knowledge).

A practical way in: pick **one recent AI paper that actually interests you**, try to reproduce a small part of it, and see where you fail. That failure tells you what you need to learn and whether you even like research.

Before going further, tell me:
- Your background (math, CS, something else?)
- Are you a student or self-studying?
- Do you want academic research or industry research?

Your answers change the advice completely.
