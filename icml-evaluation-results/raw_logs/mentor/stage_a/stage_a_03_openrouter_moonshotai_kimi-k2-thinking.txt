Experienced researcher switching fields. Lead with honest assessment: physics PhD is an advantage but habits can mislead. Give a concrete entry path, not a survey. Focus on skill gaps, fastest credibility, and a first project. 200–250 words.

You’re actually in a good position—but only if you **stop thinking like a physicist when choosing problems**. Most physics PhDs fail in AI by aiming too abstract, too clean, or too “fundamental” too early.

Where to begin, concretely:

**Your immediate gap is not math. It’s ML taste and empirical discipline.** You need to learn what *actually works*, not what should work.

The fastest entry is this: **reproduce a strong, recent ML paper end‑to‑end**, ideally one with code and nontrivial empirical claims. Not skim it. Reproduce it, break it, modify one thing, and see what changes. This trains the instincts reviewers care about: baselines, ablations, failure modes.

Given your physics background, start in areas where your priors help rather than hurt:
- representation learning on structured data
- scientific ML / surrogate modeling
- spatiotemporal prediction (weather, fluids, dynamics)

What *not* to do initially:
- invent a new theory of learning
- propose a novel architecture without benchmarking
- chase “AI for X” without mastering standard ML workflows

Your first 3–6 months should produce:
- fluency with PyTorch, training pipelines, debugging
- intuition for overfitting, scaling, and dataset pathologies
- one modest but solid empirical result (even negative)

Before I push you further, answer this:  
**Are you aiming for academic ML (NeurIPS/ICML) or industry research?** The starting paper and strategy differ, and choosing wrong will cost you a year.
