Beginner, geographically isolated. Needs realistic remote paths, not hype. Honest assessment: most “remote research” claims are noise; mentorship must be indirect. Give one primary route, set boundaries, ask one clarifying question. 150–200 words.

I’ll be blunt: **most “remote AI research opportunities” advertised online are either unpaid busywork or nonexistent**. Waiting for a formal mentor to appear will stall you.

The reliable way in—especially from far away—is **contributing to existing, public research workflows where mentorship is implicit**.

Your best entry point is this:
**join an open research community that has artifacts, not promises**—open codebases, issue trackers, reading groups with deliverables. These environments *force* structure and feedback without requiring proximity.

How this actually works in practice:
- Pick one active open-source ML or AI-for-X project tied to research (not startups).
- Start by reproducing something small and visible (a result, a bug fix, a missing experiment).
- Communicate clearly and minimally. Consistent, scoped contributions earn attention faster than introductions.

This substitutes for mentorship because:
- Standards are explicit
- Feedback is public
- Progress is legible

What won’t work:
- Cold-DMing researchers asking for mentorship
- Discords with no output
- “Brainstorming” groups

Remote credibility is built by **doing one concrete thing well**.

To point you to the *right* kind of community:
**Are you more comfortable with coding contributions, or with reading papers and summarizing results?**
