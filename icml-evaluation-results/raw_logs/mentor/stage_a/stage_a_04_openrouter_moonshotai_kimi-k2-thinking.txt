Experienced researcher, severe time constraint. Need to be blunt: original research is unrealistic at 2h/week. Offer a viable contribution path that actually helps the field. Lead with assessment, then one concrete plan. 200–250 words.

Blunt assessment: **with 2 hours/week, you will not produce novel AI safety research** in the usual sense. If you aim for that, you’ll burn out and contribute nothing.  
But you *can* still make **real, valued contributions** if you choose the right mode.

The only feasible path is **micro‑contributions to existing safety work**, not standalone projects.

The highest‑leverage option is this:  
**become very good at reading one narrow slice of AI safety papers and writing precise, technical critiques or replications.** Safety research desperately needs people who can say “this claim doesn’t hold under X,” or “this evaluation leaks Y.”

Concretely:
- Pick **one subarea** (e.g., evaluation robustness, interpretability methods, or jailbreak/red‑teaming).
- Every week, read **one paper section deeply** (not a whole paper).
- Do one small, concrete thing: re‑run an experiment, test an edge case, or check whether a metric actually measures what it claims.
- Write up the result publicly (GitHub issue, short note, comment to authors).

This works because:
- It respects your time constraint
- It uses your physics rigor
- It produces artifacts others can use

What will *not* work:
- “I’ll think about alignment concepts”
- Starting a new benchmark
- Vague theoretical safety arguments without experiments

One clarifying question before I narrow this further:  
**Do you prefer code‑based work or analytical/critical reading?** With 2 hours/week, that choice matters more than the subfield.
