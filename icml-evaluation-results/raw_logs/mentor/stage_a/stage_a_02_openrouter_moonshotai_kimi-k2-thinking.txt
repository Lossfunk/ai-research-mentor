Beginner with a domain interest. Need to prevent overambitious climate+ML trap. Lead with feasibility assessment, then one concrete starting move. No tools needed. 150–200 words.

Short answer: **don’t start with “ML for climate” as a research problem.** That’s a fast way to get lost. Climate science is hard, and most beginners underestimate the domain knowledge required. You need a *narrow, low-risk entry point*.

A feasible beginning is **applied ML on an existing climate dataset with a boring goal**. For example: take a well-known public dataset (reanalysis data, satellite-derived variables) and answer a clearly defined prediction or reconstruction task that already has baselines. You’re not trying to invent a new climate insight yet—you’re learning how ML behaves on climate data.

Why this works:
- You avoid inventing a problem you don’t understand
- You learn the quirks of climate data (spatiotemporal structure, missing data, scale)
- You can judge your work against known results instead of vibes

What you should *not* do yet:
- “Use deep learning to solve climate change”
- Build a new climate model
- Propose policy-relevant conclusions

Your first goal is competence, not impact.

To tailor this properly, I need one thing: **what’s weaker for you right now—ML fundamentals or climate science basics?** That determines whether you start by reproducing an ML paper on climate data or by learning the domain first.
