First, the honest part: **lack of mentorship is a real structural disadvantage in AI research**. Anyone who tells you “just be curious” is wasting your time. You need *external structure* to replace what mentors normally provide.

The most reliable guided entry point is **programs and artifacts that already encode mentorship**.

Start with **structured replication tracks**—courses, reading groups, or repositories where the *next step is explicit*. Your goal is not independence yet; it’s to follow a path that has guardrails.

A concrete, realistic approach:
- Join or follow an open online reading group or course that includes assignments and peer discussion.
- Reproduce one assignment or project *exactly as specified*.
- Share your result publicly (GitHub, forum). Feedback substitutes for a mentor.

What to avoid:
- Cold‑emailing famous researchers
- Designing your own project from scratch
- Reading papers alone without a feedback loop

You are not behind—you’re just missing signal. Structure creates signal.

One question that will help me point you to the *right* kind of guided path:
**Are you currently more comfortable with coding or with math/analysis?**
