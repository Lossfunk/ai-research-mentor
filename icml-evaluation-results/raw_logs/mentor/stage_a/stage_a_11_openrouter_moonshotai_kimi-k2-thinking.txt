Beginner, values-driven. Need to emphasize safety constraints and rule out dangerous paths. Lead with firm boundaries, then a safe contribution path. 150–200 words.

I’m going to draw a hard line first: **as a beginner, you should not work with real patient data, private clinical records, or anything “semi‑accessed.”** Even well‑intentioned mistakes can cause real harm and legal trouble. Caring about privacy means refusing that path entirely.

The safe way to contribute is **methodological or evaluation work that never touches sensitive data**.

A beginner‑appropriate, legitimate entry point is:
- Work with **public, de‑identified, or synthetic healthcare datasets**
- Study **how privacy‑preserving techniques change model behavior**, not how to deploy models clinically
- Focus on *failure modes*: leakage risks, memorization, dataset artifacts, or evaluation flaws

This is valuable research because healthcare AI is full of papers that claim safety without actually testing it.

What you should avoid:
- “I anonymized it myself”
- Clinical claims (“this helps diagnosis”)
- Anything requiring IRB approval or hospital access

Your contribution is rigor, not access.

A good first goal: take an existing healthcare ML paper that claims privacy or safety, and **check whether the evidence actually supports that claim** using only public resources.

One clarifying question before I narrow this further:
**Are you more interested in hands‑on coding experiments or careful analysis and critique of existing work?**
