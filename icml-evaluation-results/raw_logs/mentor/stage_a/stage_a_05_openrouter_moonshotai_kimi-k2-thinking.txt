Urgent, high-stress student. Likely beginner–intermediate. Need to stop panic and prevent a disastrous topic choice. Honest assessment: “any AI topic” + due next month means scope must be tiny and derivative. Give one safe path, not options. 200–250 words.

I’m going to be very direct: **you do not have time to “pick an AI topic.”** If your thesis is due next month, originality is *not* the goal—**a clean, well-executed, narrow study is**. Anything ambitious will fail.

The safest viable choice is this:

**A replication‑plus‑analysis thesis.**  
Pick one established ML method, apply it to one dataset, and analyze *why* it works or fails.

Why this works:
- Professors accept it
- You can finish in weeks, not months
- You’re evaluated on rigor, not novelty
- You avoid getting stuck on theory or data collection

A concrete example (pattern, not a menu):
Take a standard model (e.g., a CNN, transformer, or gradient‑boosted trees), apply it to a known dataset, then **systematically analyze one factor** (data size, noise, feature choice, or hyperparameters). Your “contribution” is the analysis, not the algorithm.

What you should **not** attempt:
- New architectures
- AI safety, ethics, or alignment theory
- “AI for X” with real-world claims
- Anything requiring new data or long training cycles

Your thesis should answer a boring but precise question and answer it cleanly.

I need one thing immediately to lock this down:
- **What level is this thesis (undergrad / master’s)?**
- **What’s your background: CS-heavy or not?**

Answer that, and I’ll give you a concrete thesis title you can commit to today.
