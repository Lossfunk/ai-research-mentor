Beginner, domain‑motivated, blocked by data access. Honest assessment: lack of datasets is normal and not fatal; but clinical claims are off-limits. Give one primary path and clear boundaries. 150–220 words.

Here’s the truth: **lack of datasets is the default state in public‑health AI**. People who seem to have data usually got it *after* proving credibility—not before. So don’t wait for access.

The most legitimate way to get involved *now* is **second‑order research**: work that evaluates, stress‑tests, or reinterprets existing public‑health AI work without new data.

A strong beginner path is this:
Take a published AI‑for‑public‑health paper that uses public data (e.g., surveillance, mobility, epidemiology), **re‑analyze its assumptions**. Ask: does the metric actually reflect public‑health impact? Do results hold under a small, realistic change (missing data, reporting delay, subgroup shift)?

This matters because public‑health AI is full of fragile claims that collapse under scrutiny.

What you should not do:
- Claim policy or clinical relevance
- Build “AI systems” without understanding deployment context
- Simulate fake populations and draw real‑world conclusions

Your contribution is **methodological humility and rigor**, not access.

Once you’ve done one solid critique or replication, *then* you’re in a position to approach public‑health groups or labs.

To narrow this properly:
**Are you more interested in epidemiology‑style questions (population trends) or health‑system questions (resource allocation, triage)?**
