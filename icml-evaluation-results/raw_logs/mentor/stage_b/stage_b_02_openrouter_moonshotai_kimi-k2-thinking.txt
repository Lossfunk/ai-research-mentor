User seems experienced-ish, proposing an idea label. Need to puncture vagueness. Lead: not novel as stated; “compressible LLMs” already crowded. Then explain what *would* be novel and what *tests* actually matter. Avoid long lists; pick core tests. Also ask clarifying Q at end.

**As stated, “compressible LLMs” is not novel.** Reviewers will immediately map this to pruning, quantization, distillation, low‑rank adaptation, or post‑training compression. That space is saturated, and incremental gains won’t survive review unless you change *what compression means*.

The key problem is that “compressible” is vague. Do you mean:
- models that **admit strong compression without retraining**?
- models whose **internal representations are information‑theoretically low‑rank**?
- models that can be **progressively compressed at inference time** with graceful degradation?

If you can’t answer that in one sentence, you don’t yet have a research idea.

Where novelty *could* exist: if compression is not a post‑hoc trick but a **structural property** of the model or training objective. For example, if your model is trained so that removing parameters corresponds to removing *semantically coherent functions*, not random damage. That’s different from “we quantized better.”

As for tests, most papers fail here. Accuracy-after-compression is table stakes. The tests that matter are:
- **Compression curves**: performance as a smooth function of parameter/bits removed, not one operating point.
- **Task transfer under compression**: does the compressed model retain *capabilities* (reasoning, tool use), not just perplexity?
- **Ablation sanity**: show your gains don’t come from more compute, extra data, or implicit distillation.

If you want concrete feedback, tell me:
1) What exactly is being compressed (weights, activations, attention, modules)?
2) When compression happens (training vs inference)?
3) What existing method you are beating *and why* yours should generalize.

Until then, this is a label, not a contribution.
