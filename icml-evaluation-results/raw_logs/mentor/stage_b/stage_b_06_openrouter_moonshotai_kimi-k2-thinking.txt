Very vague idea, no details. User likely early-stage. Need to say cannot assess viability without specifics, explain why mixing bio + transformers is common, and ask pointed clarifying questions. 50–120 words.

**I can’t judge viability yet—and that’s already a warning sign.**  
“Mixing biology datasets with transformers” is extremely common now. In many subfields (genomics, protein structure, single‑cell), transformers are the *default*, not a novelty. So unless you’re very specific, the answer is almost certainly “this has been done.”

To assess viability, I need concrete answers to just three things:
- **What biological object** (DNA sequence, protein, cells, patients)?
- **What task** (prediction, generation, representation, causal inference)?
- **What pain point** existing models fail at?

If you can’t state those cleanly, the idea isn’t ready.  
Give me a 2–3 sentence version with those details, and I’ll tell you honestly whether it’s viable or a dead end.
