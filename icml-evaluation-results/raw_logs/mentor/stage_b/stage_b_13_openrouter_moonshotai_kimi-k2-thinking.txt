**Yes, there is room—but only if you abandon mainstream “XAI” instincts.**  
Generic explainable‑AI methods (feature attributions, saliency, SHAP‑style text) will *not* be innovative or useful over SMS. If that’s your plan, stop now—reviewers will call it explanation theater.

Where real innovation can exist is in **explanations under extreme constraints**: low literacy, no visuals, intermittent connectivity, high stakes, and deep mistrust of automated advice. Most XAI work assumes the opposite.

The key shift you need to make:  
The explanation is **not for transparency**, it’s for **behavior change and error detection**. If your SMS explanation doesn’t help a farmer decide *whether to trust, question, or override* the recommendation, it failed—no matter how faithful it is to the model.

What makes this viable:
- Explanations as **actionable contrasts** (“If rainfall is late, do X instead of Y”), not model internals.
- Explicit handling of **uncertainty and disagreement**, not just point advice.
- Evaluation based on **decisions and outcomes**, not user satisfaction.

The main pitfall is paternalism: pushing “interpretable” outputs that make researchers feel good but don’t map to farmers’ reasoning or constraints.

If you want a serious assessment, tell me:
- What decision the farmer is making
- What model produces the advice
- What failure would be worse: false confidence or under‑use

That’s where novelty lives—or dies.
