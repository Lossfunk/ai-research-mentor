User seems early–mid stage researcher, asking novelty. Need honest: broadly no, but with nuance. I searched arXiv: GNNs used for ice sheets, some sea-ice adjacent; sea-ice forecasting specifically with graph nets is sparse but directionally explored. Need to save them from vague “explore”. Answer: not novel as stated; novelty requires specific angle. Ask clarifying Qs at end. 150–200 words.

**Short answer: “using graph nets for sea‑ice forecasting” is *not* novel enough.** Reviewers will say this is an obvious idea in 2026.

Here’s why. Graph neural networks have already been applied to **ice-sheet and polar ice dynamics**, mainly as emulators of physical models and for spatiotemporal prediction on irregular meshes. While most published work targets *ice sheets* rather than *sea ice*, the methodological leap from grid-based CNNs to graphs for geophysical fields is well-trodden. Several groups (notably Rahnemoonfar’s) have established this pattern. So the *model class + domain* combination alone won’t clear a novelty bar.

That said, **sea‑ice forecasting still has gaps** where a graph formulation *could* be genuinely interesting—but only if you’re precise:

- If you’re just replacing a CNN with a GNN on the same data, that’s dead on arrival.
- If your graph encodes **physical interactions** that grids can’t (e.g., floe–floe interactions, deforming topology, advection on moving meshes, coupling to ocean currents), now you may have something.
- If you target a **forecasting regime current models fail at** (lead formation, marginal ice zone dynamics, extreme events), that’s where novelty could live.

Before going further, tell me:
- What spatial representation are you imagining (fixed grid, adaptive mesh, floes)?
- Forecast horizon and variable (extent, thickness, velocity, concentration)?
- Are you aiming at ML novelty or climate-science impact?

Without sharp answers, this idea is too vague to be worth months of work.
