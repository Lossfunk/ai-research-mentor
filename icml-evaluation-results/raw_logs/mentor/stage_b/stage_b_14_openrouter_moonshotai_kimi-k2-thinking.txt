User is likely experienced; topic is trendy. Need blunt assessment: crowded, high hype; novelty only with concrete quantum advantage or constraint; feasibility low near-term. Provide guidance and baselines.

**Bluntly: the field is crowded, and most “hybrid quantum–classical protein design” ideas are not fresh.**  
There’s been a surge of papers proposing variational circuits, QAOA‑style modules, or quantum embeddings bolted onto classical protein models. Reviewers are now allergic to anything that doesn’t show a *clear reason* a quantum component is needed.

**Novelty only exists if you can answer one question cleanly:**  
*What specific subproblem in protein design is provably or empirically better handled by near‑term quantum hardware than by classical methods?*  
If your answer is “better exploration,” “higher expressivity,” or “future advantage,” that will not survive review.

**Feasibility is the bigger problem.**  
Current quantum devices are noisy, small, and poorly matched to the scale of protein design. If your pipeline requires more than toy peptides or assumes fault‑tolerant hardware, it’s effectively speculative. That pushes the work into theory or perspective territory, not applied ML/biology.

Where there *might* still be room:
- Very **narrow, well‑isolated subroutines** (e.g., discrete optimization over small combinatorial spaces) with honest classical baselines.
- Careful **negative results** showing no advantage under realistic noise—surprisingly publishable if done rigorously.
- Framing as **constraints‑driven systems work**, not performance claims.

Your baseline must be **state‑of‑the‑art classical protein design models** run properly. If you don’t convincingly beat or meaningfully complement them, the quantum part will be seen as decorative.

If you want, tell me:
- Which protein design task (sequence, structure, binding)?
- What quantum hardware you’re assuming *today*?
- Whether you’re aiming for biology impact or quantum methodology?

That determines whether this is a serious research direction or hype recycling.
