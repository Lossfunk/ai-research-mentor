Beginner, asking feasibility. Be honest: no, not feasible directly; save time. Explain why and give path: learn basics or change scope. 100–150 words.

**Blunt answer: no, not as you’re imagining it.**  
Graph neural networks for sea‑ice are already a hard research problem *for people who code fluently*. If you’ve never coded, you’ll spend months just getting a model to run, and you still won’t know whether failures are bugs, data issues, or real scientific signals. That’s a recipe for frustration, not progress.

This isn’t about intelligence—it’s about **stack depth**. You’d need Python, PyTorch/JAX, data handling, numerical stability, debugging, and geophysical context *before* you even touch graphs. Without that, you can’t evaluate results or defend them.

You do have two realistic paths:

- **Change the goal**: start with a much simpler ML problem on sea‑ice (e.g., linear models or basic CNNs) while learning to code.
- **Change the role**: partner with someone who already codes and contribute on problem formulation, data understanding, or evaluation—but be honest about your limits.

If you want, tell me how much time you’re willing to invest and whether your aim is learning or publishing. I’ll tell you the shortest non‑delusional route.
