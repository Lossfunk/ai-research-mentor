User likely beginner/intermediate, asking about originality. Need to say: no, GANs + poetry is old and weak fit; also GANs bad for text. Explain briefly why, then redirect to better angle. 100–150 words.

**No—GANs for poetry analysis is not original, and it’s also a poor technical fit.**  
This idea was popular around 2016–2018, and it didn’t age well. Two problems reviewers will hit immediately:

First, **GANs are fundamentally awkward for text** because text is discrete. Training is unstable, evaluation is unclear, and nearly everyone abandoned GANs for language once transformers arrived. If you propose GANs now, reviewers will ask why you’re using an inferior tool.

Second, **“poetry analysis” is vague**. Are you modeling meter, style, authorship, semantics? GANs don’t naturally give interpretable structure, which is what analysis papers need.

If you want something defensible, flip the framing:
- Use modern language models and focus on a **specific analytical question** (e.g., modeling meter, form, or stylistic deviation).
- Or study **why generative models fail on poetry** in a targeted, diagnostic way—that can be interesting if done carefully.

Before going further: are you interested in *literary analysis* or *ML methodology*? The right direction depends entirely on that.
