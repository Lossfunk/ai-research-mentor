**Yes, it *can* still be novel—but only in a narrow, carefully framed way.**  
“Generative models for Indigenous language revitalization” as a headline is no longer novel. There have been many projects using LMs for low‑resource and Indigenous languages. Reviewers will assume you’re repeating that unless you make a **specific, community‑grounded contribution** that existing work doesn’t cover.

Where novelty can exist:
- **Non‑standard goals**: supporting *language learning, variation, or intergenerational transmission*, not just perplexity or BLEU.
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop generation**: models that require speaker control, correction, or co‑creation rather than autonomous text generation.
- **Data governance as a technical constraint**: training or inference that respects community ownership, consent, and revocation—most ML papers hand‑wave this.

The major pitfalls are serious, and reviewers *will* look for them:
- **Extractive framing**: treating the language as a dataset rather than a living practice. This is an instant red flag.
- **Hallucinated authority**: models producing fluent but incorrect forms that learners trust more than elders.
- **Evaluation mismatch**: standard NLP metrics are often meaningless here; if you rely on them alone, your paper looks naïve.

To make this viable, the model should be **subordinate to community goals**, not the centerpiece. Technically, that often means smaller, controllable models, constrained generation, and explicit uncertainty—not scaling up.

Before going further, I need to know:
- Are you working *with* a specific community?
- What stage of revitalization (learning, documentation, creative use)?
- Is your goal research, tooling, or deployment?

Without clear answers, this idea is ethically risky and scientifically weak—even if well‑intentioned.
