User is very early-stage, possibly naive. Need to be honest but not cruel. Assessment: not novel, not research, unfalsifiable. Explain why, then redirect to a tractable slice and ask about background.

**No. This is not a novel research idea—and it’s not really a research idea at all.**  
“Create AGI to solve world hunger” is a goal statement, not a testable hypothesis. AGI itself is undefined, world hunger is a socio‑political problem, and there’s no causal chain you could evaluate in a paper. A reviewer wouldn’t even know what success means.

More importantly: **world hunger is not blocked on intelligence.** We already know how to produce enough food. The bottlenecks are logistics, incentives, conflict, policy, and distribution. An abstract AGI doesn’t address those without very specific deployment assumptions—which you haven’t articulated.

If you actually want to work on this space, you need to **collapse the scope by 100×**. For example: decision support for crop yield under climate stress, supply‑chain optimization for food aid, or forecasting famine risk from satellite and economic data. Those are concrete, measurable, and ML can matter.

Before going further: what’s your background, and are you aiming for a research paper, a product, or a philanthropic intervention?
