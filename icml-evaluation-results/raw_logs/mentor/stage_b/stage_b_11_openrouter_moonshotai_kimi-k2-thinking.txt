User is mid-level, asking how to assess novelty and feasibility, not proposing a full plan yet. Need to be blunt: crowded area, simulation trap, real-world feasibility low; give concrete criteria to assess both. Avoid long lists; keep to core axes.

**Baseline truth: this area is crowded, and feasibility is the real bottleneck—not algorithms.**  
RL for wildfire containment (including drones) has been explored many times in simulation. If your idea lives only in a simulator, it’s almost certainly *not* novel enough in 2026.

**How to assess novelty (quickly):**  
Ask one hard question: *What constraint are you addressing that prior RL-for-wildfire papers explicitly ignore?*  
If the answer is “better policy,” “multi-agent RL,” or “more realistic fire spread,” that’s already been done. Novelty only appears if RL is used to handle something fundamentally messy: partial observability with unreliable sensors, human–AI coordination with incident commanders, or decision-making under legal/safety constraints. If you can’t name the neglected constraint in one sentence, reviewers will.

**How to assess feasibility (brutally):**  
Ignore the learning algorithm and ask: *Could this ever fly—literally and institutionally?*  
Wildfires involve airspace regulation, extreme dynamics, sparse rewards, and zero tolerance for unsafe exploration. RL struggles exactly where data is scarce and mistakes are catastrophic. If your approach requires online learning or policy exploration during fires, it’s not feasible.

What *is* feasible: RL as an **offline planning or decision-support tool**, trained on historical or simulated data but never acting autonomously; or RL restricted to **narrow, verifiable sub-tasks** (e.g., resource positioning under fixed rules).

If you want a serious answer, tell me:
- Is this simulation-only or tied to real deployment?
- Who makes the final decision—the drone or a human?
- What existing system fails that motivates RL at all?

Those answers will determine whether this is publishable, fundable, or fantasy.
