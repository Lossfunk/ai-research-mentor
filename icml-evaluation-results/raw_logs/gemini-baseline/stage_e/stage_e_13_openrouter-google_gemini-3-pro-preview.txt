Here is a discussion paragraph that balances scientific honesty with a defense of the paper's methodological contribution. It uses the concept of **"Non-Stationarity"** to frame the problem academically.

### Discussion: Temporal Stationarity and Replication Challenges

"We explicitly acknowledge that the peer review process is a non-stationary target. Our model captures the specific scientific zeitgeist and community norms of the training window, rendering it susceptible to temporal degradation. Two primary factors limit direct replication on newer conference cycles:

1.  **Semantic Drift:** The vocabulary of 'novelty' evolves rapidly in ML/NLP; technical terms associated with state-of-the-art performance in the training set (e.g., specific architecture names) may signal obsolescence in subsequent years.
2.  **Policy and Structural Shift:** Institutional changes to reviewer guidelines—such as the introduction of mandatory ethics statements, the relaxation of page limits, or the shift toward rolling review models (e.g., ARR)—fundamentally alter the structural distribution of submissions.

Therefore, the trained model should not be viewed as a static 'oracle' but as a baseline for the era it represents. We posit that while the *specific weights* of lexical features are transient, the *methodology* for extracting rhetorical and structural signals remains valid. Future deployments would require a 'continuous calibration' framework, where the model is periodically retrained on the most recent proceedings to align its decision boundary with the current definition of acceptance."
