This experimental design tests the hypothesis that **Privacy/Governance Constraints** (specifically the resource constraints required for offline, on-premise inference) degrade the model's **Calibration**—its ability to "know when it doesn't know."

In "Verification-like" tasks (e.g., Fact-Checking or Legal Entailment), a failure isn't just a wrong prediction; it is a **High-Confidence Error** or a failure to predict "Not Enough Information."

### 1. Defining the Constraint: "The Offline Enclave"

To simulate a strict governance environment (where data cannot leave a secure facility and compute is limited), we apply two specific constraints to the Hierarchical Transformer:

1.  **Constraint A (Quantization):** Convert the model weights from `Float32` to `Int8` (Dynamic Quantization). This simulates deployment on secure edge hardware or non-GPU servers.
2.  **Constraint B (Sanitization):** Pre-processing that aggressively masks entities (Dates, Names, Locations) using `[MASK]` tokens before inference, simulating PII redaction protocols.

### 2. Datasets (Verification-Centric)

We need datasets where the "absence of evidence" is a valid label, as this is where verification systems fail most often.

*   **Primary: FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification)**
    *   *Task:* Given a claim and a long document, predict `Supported`, `Refuted`, or `NotEnoughInfo` (NEI).
    *   *Relevance:* The `NEI` class is the "Verification" safety valve.
*   **Secondary: ContractNLI (Legal)**
    *   *Task:* Does a contract entail a specific clause? (Entailment / Contradiction / Not Mentioned).
    *   *Relevance:* High governance impact. "Not Mentioned" requires scanning the whole document and *verifying* absence.

### 3. Baselines

1.  **The Oracle (Unconstrained):** The standard Hierarchical Transformer (RoBERTa-Large backbone) running in Float32 with full access to raw text.
2.  **The Quantized (Constraint A):** The exact same model, post-training quantized to Int8.
3.  **The Redacted (Constraint B):** The Oracle model running on PII-scrubbed text.

### 4. Metrics: Quantifying "Verification Failure"

Standard Accuracy is insufficient. We need to measure **Calibration** and **Fail-Safe Reliability**.

*   **Metric 1: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**
    *   Measures the gap between Model Confidence and Empirical Accuracy.
    *   *Hypothesis:* Constraints will increase ECE (Model remains confident even when quantization noise flips the prediction).
*   **Metric 2: NEI-Recall (The "Safety Rate")**
    *   Specifically measures the recall on the `NotEnoughInfo` class.
    *   *Failure Mode:* If the constrained model hallucinates evidence due to noise, NEI-Recall will drop, and `Supported/Refuted` False Positives will rise.
*   **Metric 3: The "Overconfidence Tax"**
    *   Average confidence of *incorrect* predictions.

### 5. Statistical Analysis Plan

We need to prove that the degradation in verification is statistically significant and not just random noise.

#### A. The "Reliability Diagram" Comparison
Plot the Confidence (X-axis) vs. Accuracy (Y-axis) for the Baseline and Constrained models.
*   **Visual Test:** If the Constrained curve dips below the diagonal ($y=x$) in the high-confidence region (0.8-1.0), the constraint creates **High-Confidence Hallucinations**.

#### B. Statistical Test: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test on Entropy
We want to see if the constraint reduces the model's "uncertainty awareness."
1.  Collect the **Entropy** of the prediction distribution for all **Error Cases** in the Test Set.
2.  **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The entropy distribution of errors is identical for Float32 and Int8 models.
3.  **Test:** If Int8 errors have significantly *lower* entropy (higher confidence) than Float32 errors ($p < 0.05$), the privacy constraint has structurally damaged the verification mechanism.

#### C. Impact Analysis: The "Aggregator Noise" Check
Hierarchical models rely on aggregating signals from multiple chunks. Quantization adds noise to *every* chunk embedding.
*   **Procedure:** Calculate the **Cosine Similarity** between the Level 2 (Document) embeddings of the Float32 and Int8 models.
*   **Correlation:** Correlate this similarity with the Document Length.
*   **Failure Prediction:** If similarity drops as Length increases, it proves that **Offline Constraints disproportionately affect longer documents**, causing verification failure specifically in complex cases.

### 6. Summary of Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Unconstrained (Baseline) | Offline/Quantized (Constraint) | implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 92.0% | 90.5% | Minor drop (looks acceptable). |
| **ECE (Calibration)** | 0.04 | **0.12** | **Major Failure:** Model is lying about its certainty. |
| **NEI-Recall** | 85% | **72%** | **Verification Failure:** Model "hallucinates" support where there is none. |

**Conclusion:** If the ECE spikes, you must conclude that **"Offline deployment requires re-calibration."** You cannot simply quantize a Hierarchical Verification model and expect its confidence scores to remain safe for governance decisions.
