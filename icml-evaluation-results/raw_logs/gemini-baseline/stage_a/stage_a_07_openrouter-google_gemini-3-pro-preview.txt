This is a great age to start. Some of the best researchers in the field started tinkering in their bedrooms. The constraint of "free resources only" is actually a hidden advantage: it forces you to be efficient and creative, which are the two most important traits of a researcher.

Here is your **Zero-Budget, Responsibility-First Roadmap** for high school.

### 1. The "Responsible" Part (Read This First)
Since you asked about doing this responsibly, you are already ahead of 90% of beginners. "Responsible AI" means three things for you:
*   **Academic Integrity:** Never use AI to generate your school essays. Use it to *grade* your essays or suggest improvements. If you use AI code in a project, credit it.
*   **Ethics:** Do not build "deepfake" generators or tools that harass people.
*   **Bias Awareness:** Always assume the AI is biased. If you build a face detector, test it on all skin tones. If it fails on one group, that is a research finding, not just a bug!

### 2. The Free "Hardware" (Your Lab)
You do not need a $3,000 gaming PC. You can access professional-grade GPUs for free in the cloud.
*   **Google Colab:** This gives you a free GPU in your browser. It looks like a Google Doc but runs Python code. This is where you will do 100% of your work.
*   **Kaggle Kernels:** Similar to Colab, but connected directly to datasets.
*   **HuggingFace Spaces:** A place to host your demos for free so you can show friends or college admissions officers.

### 3. The Curriculum (The "Free School")
Ignore paid bootcamps. The best education in the world is free if you know where to look.

**Step A: Learn Python (2-3 weeks)**
*   *Resource:* **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python** (Harvard/EdX). It is free, high-energy, and designed for students.
*   *Goal:* Learn variables, loops, and functions.

**Step B: Learn the "Intuition" (1 week)**
*   *Resource:* **3Blue1Brown’s "Neural Networks" series** on YouTube.
*   *Goal:* Don't memorize the calculus. Just understand what a "weight" and a "bias" are visually.

**Step C: The "Code-First" AI Course (Ongoing)**
*   *Resource:* **Fast.ai (Practical Deep Learning for Coders)**.
*   *Why:* Jeremy Howard (the teacher) focuses on getting you to build cool stuff *first*, and explains the math *later*. It is perfect for high schoolers who want to see results.

### 4. Project Ideas (The "Science Fair" Strategy)
Research at your stage isn't about inventing a new Transformer architecture. It's about **applying AI to your world.** Colleges love this.

**Idea 1: The "Hobby" Classifier (Computer Vision)**
*   *Concept:* Take a hobby you love (identifying birds, sorting Lego bricks, recognizing sneakers).
*   *Task:* Collect 50 photos of each category. Train a model in Google Colab to recognize them.
*   *The "Responsible" Angle:* Analyze where it fails. Does it confuse a blue Lego brick with a blue sky?
*   *Tool:* Fast.ai Lesson 1.

**Idea 2: The "School Newspaper" Analyzer (NLP)**
*   *Concept:* Analyze the tone of your school's newsletter or a local newspaper over time.
*   *Task:* Feed the text into a "Sentiment Analysis" model.
*   *Research Question:* "Has the school newspaper become more negative since the new cafeteria opened?"
*   *Tool:* HuggingFace `pipeline`.

**Idea 3: Accessibility Tech (AI for Good)**
*   *Concept:* Build a tool that helps someone.
*   *Task:* An app that takes a picture of a homework assignment and reads the text out loud for visually impaired students.
*   *Tool:* Optical Character Recognition (OCR) libraries + Text-to-Speech.

### 5. How to "Publish"
You probably won't get into a major scientific journal yet, and that's fine. Your goal is to build a **Portfolio**.
1.  **GitHub:** Put your code here. A messy GitHub repo is better than no repo.
2.  **Blog/Write-up:** Write a simple Medium article or a Google Doc explaining what you did.
    *   *Structure:* Problem -> What I tried -> What failed -> Final Result.
3.  **HuggingFace Demo:** Upload your model so people can actually click buttons and use it.

### Summary Checklist
1.  [ ] Create a Google account for **Colab**.
2.  [ ] Create an account on **Kaggle** and **HuggingFace**.
3.  [ ] Watch the first 4 videos of **CS50 Python**.
4.  [ ] Watch Lesson 1 of **Fast.ai**.
5.  [ ] Build a "Cat vs. Dog" classifier (the "Hello World" of AI).

You have everything you need. The only cost is your time. Good luck!
