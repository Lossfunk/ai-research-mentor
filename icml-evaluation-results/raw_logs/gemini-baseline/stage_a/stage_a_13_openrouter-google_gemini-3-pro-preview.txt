You are hitting the most common wall in Health AI: **Clinical data is private, but Public Health data is open.**

You do not need Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to do high-impact work. Public health is about **populations**, not individuals. This means the data is often aggregated, anonymized, and freely available if you know where to look.

Here are four research avenues where the data is abundant and open.

### 1. Digital Epidemiology (The "Social Listening" Approach)
Instead of waiting for hospital reports, you track disease or health sentiment in real-time using the internet.
*   **The Data:** Reddit, Google Trends, Wikipedia Page Views.
*   **The Logic:** People search for "loss of smell" before they go to the doctor for COVID. People discuss depression symptoms on forums before seeking therapy.
*   **Project Idea:** "Vaccine Hesitancy Mapping."
    *   *Action:* Scrape r/health or r/parenting (using the Reddit API).
    *   *AI Task:* Use a Sentiment Analysis model (like RoBERTa) to classify posts about vaccines as "Pro," "Anti," or "Neutral."
    *   *Analysis:* Correlate spikes in negative sentiment with real-world measles outbreaks (data from the CDC).

### 2. Environmental Determinants (The "Satellite" Approach)
Where you live determines your health. You can use Computer Vision on satellite imagery to predict health outcomes.
*   **The Data:** **Google Earth Engine** (Satellite imagery), **OpenStreetMap** (Infrastructure), and **Sentinel-5P** (Air pollution data).
*   **The Logic:** You can train an AI to spot "Food Deserts" or "High Pollution Zones" automatically.
*   **Project Idea:** "Green Space and Mental Health."
    *   *Action:* Download satellite images of 50 cities.
    *   *AI Task:* Train a Computer Vision model to calculate the percentage of "Green Coverage" (trees/parks) in each neighborhood.
    *   *Analysis:* Compare this with public health data on asthma rates or mental health prescriptions in those zip codes.

### 3. The "Secret Weapon": The DHS Program
If you want to do serious global health research, this is your gold mine.
*   **The Data:** **The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program**.
    *   USAID has conducted massive, standardized household surveys in 90+ developing countries.
    *   They track malaria, nutrition, HIV knowledge, and child mortality.
    *   *Access:* You just have to register on their website and write a paragraph about your research. It is free.
*   **Project Idea:** "Predicting Child Malnutrition from Household Assets."
    *   *AI Task:* Use Tabular Deep Learning (or XGBoost) to predict malnutrition rates based on household factors (water access, floor type, education level).

### 4. Literature Mining (The "Meta" Approach)
Doctors and policymakers cannot read the 5,000 papers published every day. They need AI to synthesize them.
*   **The Data:** **PubMed** and **CORD-19** (Open Access medical papers).
*   **The Logic:** Use NLP to extract structured data from unstructured text.
*   **Project Idea:** "Automated Drug-Interaction Discovery."
    *   *Action:* Download 1,000 abstracts about a specific disease (e.g., Diabetes).
    *   *AI Task:* Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to spot pairs of drugs mentioned together with negative words ("adverse," "failure," "risk").
    *   *Outcome:* A knowledge graph showing potential bad drug combinations.

### Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Don't look for "Medical Images."** That is a crowded field.
2.  **Go to "Google Dataset Search".**
3.  **Type:** "Air Quality Index [Your City]" or "CDC Wonder" (The CDC's open database).
4.  **Download a CSV.**

Your contribution to public health won't be diagnosing a patient; it will be **identifying the invisible risks** that make populations sick in the first place. That is equally powerful.
