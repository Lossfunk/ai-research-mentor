The feeling of overwhelm is a symptom of the "Hype Cycle." Right now, 90% of AI content is marketing, not education.

To learn safely, you need to ignore the **"News"** and focus on the **"Science."** News changes every day; the math behind Neural Networks hasn't changed much in 10 years.

Here is a curated **"Low-Noise, High-Signal" Learning Path**. It consists of only 4 resources. If a YouTuber or influencer is not on this list, ignore them for now.

### Step 1: The Intuition (Visuals)
**Resource:** **3Blue1Brown (YouTube) - "Neural Networks" Series**
*   **Time:** 2 hours.
*   **Why:** Grant Sanderson explains *how* a neural network learns using visual animations, not jargon. He doesn't sell you anything. He just shows you the calculus visually.
*   **The "Safety" Check:** If anyone tells you AI is "magic" or "sentient," come back to these videos. You will remember it is just matrix multiplication.

### Step 2: The Code (The "Source of Truth")
**Resource:** **Andrej Karpathy (YouTube) - "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"**
*   **Time:** 10–20 hours.
*   **Why:** Karpathy was the Director of AI at Tesla and a founder of OpenAI. He is the best teacher in the world right now.
*   **The Method:** He opens a blank code editor and writes a Neural Network line-by-line, explaining every single character.
*   **The Outcome:** By the end, you will have built a GPT (like ChatGPT) from scratch. You will no longer be impressed by hype because you will know exactly how the sausage is made.

### Step 3: The Theory (The "Pocket Guide")
**Resource:** **"The Little Book of Deep Learning" by François Fleuret**
*   **Time:** Reference material.
*   **Why:** It is free, formatted for mobile phones, and written by a serious professor. It cuts out all the fluff and history and just gives you the modern equations and definitions.
*   **Use Case:** When you hear a term like "Overfitting" or "Tensor," look it up here.

### Step 4: The News (The Filter)
**Resource:** **"Last Week in AI" (Newsletter/Podcast)**
*   **Time:** 15 minutes per week.
*   **Why:** They summarize the news, but they explicitly mark things as "Hype" vs. "Real Research." They are PhD students who are skeptical by nature.
*   **The Rule:** If it's not in this newsletter, you probably don't need to know about it.

### The "Anti-Reading" List (What to Avoid)
To keep your sanity, actively **block** or **ignore** these sources:
1.  **"AI Influencers" on X/Twitter:** If their bio says "AI Guy" or "Futurist" but they don't link to a GitHub repo or a paper, mute them. They thrive on anxiety.
2.  **"Prompt Engineering" Courses:** Do not pay for these. Prompting is a soft skill you learn by doing, not a science you buy.
3.  **Mainstream News Headlines:** Journalists often confuse "Science Fiction" with "Science Fact" to get clicks (e.g., "AI becomes sentient!"). Stick to the technical sources above.

**Your Mantra:** "If I cannot build it (or understand the code), I do not understand it." Stick to the code, and the hype can't hurt you.
