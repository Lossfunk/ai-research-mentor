**Panic Mode: OFF. Execution Mode: ON.**

One month is extremely short for a thesis. You do not have time to collect data, invent a new architecture, or train a model from scratch. If you try to do something "fancy," you will fail.

You need a **"Evaluation & Analysis"** thesis. This means taking *existing* models and *existing* datasets and testing a specific hypothesis.

Here are three "Emergency Thesis" topics that are scientifically valid, high-impact, and doable in 4 weeks. **Pick one immediately.**

### Option 1: The "LLM Jailbreak" Analysis (Natural Language Processing)
*   **The Pitch:** "A Comparative Analysis of Safety Guardrails in Open Source vs. Closed Source LLMs."
*   **The Experiment:**
    1.  Select 3 models (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama-3-70B, and Mistral).
    2.  Create a dataset of 50 "borderline" prompts (e.g., asking for medical advice, asking how to make mild explosives, asking for political bias).
    3.  Use an automated "Jailbreak" technique (like DAN or simple persona adoption).
    4.  Record the failure rate of each model.
*   **Why it works:** No training required. You are just prompting models and recording results.
*   **Tools:** Python, OpenAI API, HuggingFace Inference API.

### Option 2: The "Data Pollution" Test (Computer Vision)
*   **The Pitch:** "The Impact of Gaussian Noise and Image Compression on the Accuracy of ResNet-50."
*   **The Experiment:**
    1.  Download a standard dataset like **CIFAR-10** (tiny images, fast to process).
    2.  Download a pre-trained **ResNet** model (available in PyTorch with one line of code).
    3.  Run the model on clean data -> Record accuracy (Baseline).
    4.  Write a script to progressively add "noise" (blur, pixelation, or blacking out parts of the image) to the test set.
    5.  Plot a graph: *X-axis = Amount of Noise*, *Y-axis = Model Accuracy*.
*   **Why it works:** It’s pure science. You are measuring the "Robustness" of a model. You can generate the results in one afternoon.
*   **Tools:** PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib.

### Option 3: The "RAG" Hallmark (Applied AI)
*   **The Pitch:** "Retrieval Augmented Generation: Does Chunk Size Matter for Summarization Quality?"
*   **The Experiment:**
    1.  Take a long PDF (like a legal document or a Harry Potter book).
    2.  Build a simple RAG system (Chat with your PDF) using **LlamaIndex** or **LangChain**.
    3.  **The Variable:** Change how you chop up the text (Chunk size: 256 tokens vs 512 tokens vs 1024 tokens).
    4.  Ask the AI to answer 20 specific questions based on the text.
    5.  Manually grade the answers.
*   **Why it works:** RAG is the hottest topic in industry right now. This is a very practical thesis.
*   **Tools:** Python, LlamaIndex, OpenAI API.

### Your 4-Week Schedule (Stick to this)

**Week 1: The Setup (Days 1-7)**
*   **Days 1-2:** Pick the topic. Download the dataset. Get the code running (find a GitHub repo that already does 80% of what you need).
*   **Days 3-7:** Write the **Introduction** and **Literature Review**. Do not wait for results. Write about *why* this problem matters. (Use tools like Perplexity.ai or Elicit to find citations fast).

**Week 2: The Experiment (Days 8-14)**
*   Run the code.
*   **Crucial Advice:** If the code fails, *change the scope*. Don't spend 5 days debugging. If Model A doesn't work, switch to Model B.
*   Generate your Tables and Graphs. Once you have a graph, the research is "done."

**Week 3: The Analysis (Days 15-21)**
*   Write the **Methodology** (what you did) and **Results** (what happened) sections.
*   Describe the graphs. "As shown in Figure 1, accuracy dropped by 20%..."
*   Write the **Discussion**: Why did it happen? (It's okay to guess, provided you cite sources).

**Week 4: The Polish (Days 22-28)**
*   Write the **Abstract** and **Conclusion** (write these last).
*   Format the bibliography.
*   **Submit.**

### Final Tip for Speed
**Don't be original.**
If you find a paper from 2021 that did this experiment on GPT-3, **do the exact same experiment** on GPT-4.
*   *Title:* "Revisiting [Original Paper Title] in the Era of GPT-4."
*   This is valid science (Replication/Update) and it saves you from having to design the methodology yourself.
