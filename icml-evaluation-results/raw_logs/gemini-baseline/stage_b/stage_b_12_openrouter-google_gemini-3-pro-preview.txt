This is a **very strong, socially relevant** research proposal.

It is **novel** because it sits at the intersection of two disconnected fields: **Technical AI Alignment** (Calibration) and **Pedagogical Psychology** (Self-Efficacy).

Most EdTech companies are trying to make LLMs "smarter." You are proposing making them **"humble."** In a Community College (CC) setting, where students often struggle with "Imposter Syndrome" or are returning to education after a long break, an AI that acts like an arrogant know-it-all can be discouraging.

Here is how to frame the novelty and the specific baselines you need.

### 1. The Novelty: "Pedagogical Calibration"
The technical definition of calibration is: *If the model says it is 80% confident, it should be correct 80% of the time.*

Your novelty is applying this to **trust dynamics** in learning.
*   **The Problem:** Standard LLMs (ChatGPT) are confident bullshitters. If a student asks a question and the AI confidently gives a wrong answer, the student (who lacks domain knowledge) will believe it, learn the wrong thing, and fail the exam.
*   **The Novel Hypothesis:** An LLM that explicitly displays **uncertainty markers** (e.g., "I am mostly sure, but this is a complex topic...") will:
    1.  Reduce "Over-reliance" (blindly copying the AI).
    2.  Encourage "Metacognition" (critical thinking) in the student.
    3.  Increase long-term retention compared to a standard "confident" AI.

### 2. The Baselines (What to Compare Against)
You need three distinct baselines to prove your system works.

#### Baseline A: The "Standard" (Zero-Shot GPT-4)
*   **The Setup:** Standard prompt: *"You are a helpful tutor. Answer the student's question."*
*   **The Flaw:** It will answer hallucinations with 100% confidence.

#### Baseline B: The "Verbalized Uncertainty" (Prompt Engineering)
*   **The Setup:** Prompt: *"Answer the question, but if you are unsure, admit it. Estimate your confidence level at the end."*
*   **The Test:** Does the model actually admit ignorance, or does it say "I'm 90% sure" while being wrong? (Research shows models are often bad at self-assessing via text).

#### Baseline C: The "Logit-Calibrated" (Your Method)
*   **The Setup:** You don't trust the text output. You look at the **token probabilities (logits)**.
*   **The Mechanism:** If the model's internal probability for the answer is low (high entropy), your interface intercepts the answer and forces a UI change.
    *   *Instead of showing the answer, it says:* "This is a tricky question. I think the answer is X, but let's check the textbook together."

### 3. The Experiments & Tests

#### Test 1: The "Trust Trap" (Critical)
You need to trick the students to measure their critical thinking.
*   **The Setup:** Give the students 10 questions. Deliberately rig the AI to give a **plausible but wrong answer** on question #7.
*   **Condition A (Standard AI):** AI gives the wrong answer confidently.
*   **Condition B (Calibrated AI):** AI gives the wrong answer but adds "I am only 55% sure about this."
*   **The Measurement:** How many students simply copy the wrong answer?
    *   *Hypothesis:* The Calibrated AI will cause students to pause, double-check, and reject the wrong answer. This is a massive win for educational outcomes.

#### Test 2: The "Imposter Syndrome" Survey (The CC Context)
Community College students often feel they "don't belong" in academia.
*   **The Qualitative Metric:** After using the tutor, survey the students.
*   **The Question:** "Did the AI make you feel stupid?"
*   **Hypothesis:** An AI that admits "I don't know" makes the *student* feel more comfortable with not knowing everything, whereas a hyper-confident AI reinforces the idea that "everyone knows this except me."

### 4. Implementation Strategy
*   **Domain:** Pick a specific subject common in CCs, like **Remedial Algebra** or **Intro to Composition**.
*   **Data:** Do not train a model from scratch. Use **Llama-3 (8B or 70B)** and access the logprobs (probabilities).
*   **Calibration Technique:** Use **Temperature Scaling** or **Platt Scaling** on the output logits to get a true confidence score.

### Summary
**Is it Novel?** Yes. Applying *Uncertainty Quantification* to *EdTech HCI* is a fresh angle.
**The Key Insight:** You aren't trying to make the AI perfect. You are trying to make the AI **safe for learners** by making its failures transparent.
