This is going to be **extremely difficult**, but it is **feasible** if you adjust your expectations and strategy.

You are effectively trying to learn how to fly a plane (GNNs) while simultaneously learning the laws of aerodynamics (Python/Coding) and how to read a map (Sea Ice Data).

Here is the honest reality of the challenge and a roadmap to make it survivable.

### The Three Barriers You Face

1.  **The Language Barrier (Python):** You need to learn Python. Luckily, Python is the easiest language to learn, but you still need to understand variables, loops, and functions.
2.  **The Data Barrier (The "Hidden Boss"):** This is actually harder than the AI part. Sea ice data comes in complex formats (NetCDF, HDF5). It often has "holes" (missing data), different projections (stereographic), and massive file sizes. Handling this requires a library called `xarray`.
3.  **The Math Barrier (GNNs):** GNNs are abstract. Unlike an image which is a grid of pixels, a graph is a list of connections. Setting up the data structure (Adjacency Matrices) requires specific coding logic.

### The Strategy: How to Cheat (Legally)

Do not try to learn everything from scratch. You will burn out. Use these shortcuts:

#### 1. The "Frankenstein" Method
Don't write code; **assemble it.**
*   Find an existing GitHub repository that does *something similar* (e.g., "GNN for weather prediction" or "PyTorch Geometric example").
*   Clone it to Google Colab (a free online coding environment).
*   Run it to see if it works.
*   Then, try to swap their data for your data.

#### 2. Use LLMs as Your "Pair Programmer"
Since you are starting now, you have an advantage old coders didn't: **ChatGPT/Claude.**
*   **Don't ask:** "How do I build a GNN?" (Too vague).
*   **Do ask:** "Write a Python script using `xarray` to open a NetCDF file of sea ice concentration and plot the first timestamp."
*   **Do ask:** "Explain this error message to me like I'm 5."
*   **Do ask:** "Convert this sea ice grid data into a graph format compatible with PyTorch Geometric."

Your job is not to write the code, but to **audit** the code the AI writes for you.

#### 3. Partner Up (The Best Option)
Science is rarely a solo sport.
*   **You** are the "Domain Expert" (you likely understand the physics, the problem, and what "good" sea ice forecasting looks like).
*   **Find a CS Student/Colleague:** Find someone who knows Python but has no idea what "sea ice albedo" is.
*   This is a classic academic trade. You provide the novel idea and the scientific interpretation; they provide the implementation.

### Your 4-Step Roadmap (Timeline: 3–6 Months)

If you are determined to do this solo, follow this exact order. **Do not skip to step 4.**

**Month 1: The Basics**
*   Take a "Python for Data Science" course (Codecademy, Coursera, or YouTube).
*   Focus strictly on these three libraries: `NumPy` (math), `Pandas` (tables), and `Matplotlib` (plotting).
*   *Goal:* Load a CSV file and make a line graph.

**Month 2: The Data**
*   Learn `xarray`. This is the tool for climate data.
*   Download a sample Sea Ice Concentration dataset (e.g., from NSIDC).
*   *Goal:* distinct from AI, just write a script that opens the map and plots the ice for a specific day.

**Month 3: The "Hello World" of GNNs**
*   Use **PyTorch Geometric (PyG)**. It is the standard library.
*   Do their basic tutorials (classifying molecules or social networks).
*   *Goal:* Train a GNN on a tutorial dataset, not your ice data yet.

**Month 4: The Merge**
*   Now, try to feed your Month 2 data into your Month 3 model.
*   This is where you will suffer. The dimensions won't match. The memory will overflow. This is normal. This is where you use ChatGPT heavily to debug.

### Verdict
**Feasible?** Yes.
**Novel?** Yes.
**Easy?** No.

If you can find a collaborator who already codes, you can skip to the fun part (research) immediately. If you go solo, accept that the first 3 months will just be learning to speak the language.
