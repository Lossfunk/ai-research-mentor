For a **Robotics Safety** paper (e.g., Safe RL, Collision Avoidance, Human-Robot Interaction), the submission strategy differs significantly from pure ML papers. The primary difference is the **mandatory emphasis on physical plausibility** and the **Supplemental Video**.

Here is a venue-specific submission plan targeting the "Big Three": **ICRA** (IEEE), **IROS** (IEEE/RSJ), and **CoRL** (Robot Learning).

---

### **1. Venue Map & Constraints**

| Feature | **ICRA / IROS (The Standards)** | **CoRL (Robot Learning)** | **RSS (High Theory/Systems)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Broad robotics. "Does it work on a robot?" | Learning-based. "Is the learning novel & safe?" | Rigorous theory + robust systems. |
| **Page Limit** | **6 pages** (content) + unlimited refs. (Strict $100/page fee for n+2). | **8 pages** (content) + unlimited refs/appendix. | **8+ pages** (flexible, single column). |
| **Format** | IEEE Two-Column. | PMLR (Single Column). | Custom Format. |
| **Video** | **Mandatory** (Culturally). 1-3 mins. | **Mandatory.** | **Mandatory.** |
| **Anonymity** | **Double-Blind.** (Blur faces/logos). | **Double-Blind.** | **Double-Blind.** |
| **Safety Bar** | Empirical. Show it not crashing. | Statistical. Show safety bounds/probabilities. | Theoretical. Prove it cannot crash (Control Barrier Functions). |

### **2. The Supplemental Video Strategy (Crucial)**
In robotics, reviewers often watch the video *before* reading the paper. If the video is weak, the paper is rejected.

**Technical Requirements:**
*   **Format:** MPEG-4 (.mp4).
*   **Codec:** H.264 (Universally compatible).
*   **Size Limit:** Max **10MB - 20MB** (Verify specific venue; ICRA is strict on file size).
*   **Length:** 1:30 to 3:00 minutes.

**Content Checklist (The "Safety Narrative"):**
1.  **[ ] The "Kill" Shot (0:00-0:15):** Immediately show the robot performing the safe behavior in a complex environment. No title screens longer than 3 seconds.
2.  **[ ] Baseline Failures:** You *must* show the baseline (e.g., standard RL or P-Controller) crashing or violating safety constraints. This proves the problem is real.
3.  **[ ] Real-Time vs. Speed-up:** Explicitly label playback speed (e.g., "1x Real Time" or "5x Speed"). Safety claims are invalid if the video is slowed down to make the robot look controlled.
4.  **[ ] Anonymization:**
    *   Blur the faces of any students walking in the background.
    *   Cover university logos on the robot chassis with tape.
    *   Remove audio unless it is relevant (e.g., voice commands).

### **3. Artifact & Reproducibility Checklist**

**A. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)**
*   **Constraint:** Reviewers cannot download your robot.
*   **The Fix:** You must provide a **High-Fidelity Simulation** (Gazebo, MuJoCo, Isaac Gym) that mirrors your hardware setup.
    *   *Statement:* "We provide a Dockerized Isaac Gym environment pre-configured with the robot URDF and safety constraints."

**B. Safety Metrics**
*   **The Trap:** Reporting only "Success Rate."
*   **The Fix:** You must report:
    *   **Constraint Violation Rate:** How often did it almost crash?
    *   **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Minimum distance maintained.
    *   **Recovery Time:** If a safety stop triggers, how fast does it resume?

### **4. Ethical Review & Safety Compliance**

Robotics safety papers trigger specific ethics flags that pure ML papers do not.

**A. Human Subjects (HRI)**
*   **Scenario:** If your robot interacts with people (e.g., "Robot navigating a crowd").
*   **Requirement:** You need **IRB Approval** (Institutional Review Board).
*   **Paper Text:** "The user study was approved by the authors' Institutional Review Board (Protocol #XXXX). Participants were briefed on emergency stop procedures."

**B. Physical Safety Protocols**
*   **Scenario:** Testing dangerous control policies on hardware.
*   **Requirement:** Describe the "Safety Envelope."
*   **Paper Text:** "Experiments were conducted in a geo-fenced arena with a hardware-level emergency stop (E-Stop) accessible at all times. No humans were present within the robot's workspace during learning."

**C. Dual Use (weaponization)**
*   **Scenario:** If your paper is about "Agile pursuit" or "High-speed interception."
*   **Requirement:** Acknowledge potential misuse in the Broader Impact statement. Focus on "Search and Rescue" or "Drone Delivery" applications.

### **5. 6-Week Submission Countdown**

| Time | Focus | Action Item |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 6** | **Video Filming** | **Stop developing code.** Dedicate this week to filming the robot. If the hardware breaks next week, you need footage *now*. Film the "Baseline Failure" cases. |
| **Week 5** | **Sim-to-Real** | Ensure your simulation results match the hardware video. If Sim says "99% Safe" and Video shows wobbling, you will be rejected. |
| **Week 4** | **Drafting** | Write the "System Architecture" section. Include a diagram showing the "Safety Layer" (e.g., Control Barrier Function) separate from the "Learning Layer." |
| **Week 3** | **Anonymization** | **Video Audit:** Watch the video frame-by-frame. Did a student wearing a university hoodie walk by? Blur it. |
| **Week 2** | **Compression** | Compress the video to <20MB. Check if the text in the video is legible at that bitrate. |
| **Week 1** | **Submission** | Upload the Video *first*. IEEE systems often crash on video uploads near the deadline. |

### **Immediate Action Item**
**Do you have the "Baseline Failure" footage?**
If not, set up the robot *today* with the standard controller and record it failing (safely). This is the most convincing piece of evidence for a safety paper.
