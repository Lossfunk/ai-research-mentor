For a **Legal LLM** paper, the scrutiny is significantly higher than standard NLP. Reviewers at ACL, NeurIPS, or FAccT are hyper-aware of recent scandals (e.g., lawyers citing hallucinated cases) and the risks of "Unauthorized Practice of Law."

Here is the breakdown of the mandatory ethics sections, disclosure checklists, and artifact requirements specific to Legal AI.

---

### **1. Mandatory Paper Sections (The "Must-Haves")**

You must include a dedicated **"Ethics & Broader Impact"** section (usually at the end of the main text or before references). It must address these three pillars:

#### **A. The "Unauthorized Practice of Law" (UPL) Disclaimer**
*   **The Risk:** Reviewers fear your model will be used by non-lawyers (pro se litigants) instead of professional counsel, leading to disastrous life outcomes.
*   **Required Text:** You must explicitly state that the model is a **"Legal Assistive Tool"** for professionals, not a replacement for a lawyer.
    *   *Drafting Tip:* "This model is designed to assist legal professionals in information retrieval. It is not a substitute for qualified legal advice and should not be used in high-stakes decision-making without human-in-the-loop verification."

#### **B. Hallucination of Precedent (The "Avianca" Clause)**
*   **The Risk:** Legal models often invent case citations (e.g., *Mata v. Avianca*).
*   **The Fix:** You must disclose the rate at which your model fabricates statutes or case law.
*   **Compliance:** If you don't have a specific metric for "Citation Faithfulness," you will likely get a conditional accept or rejection.

#### **C. Bias in Sentencing & Case Outcome**
*   **The Risk:** Legal data is historically biased against marginalized groups.
*   **The Fix:** Acknowledge that training on historical court records encodes historical prejudices.
    *   *Drafting Tip:* "We acknowledge that the training data (US Case Law 1970-2020) reflects historical disparities in sentencing and language use. This model should not be used for sentencing recommendations or recidivism prediction."

### **2. Data Compliance & "The Black Box"**

Legal datasets (PACER, Caselaw Access Project, Pile-Law) have specific licensing and privacy traps.

| Data Source | Compliance Risk | Required Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Court Opinions** (Public) | **Privacy:** Opinions often contain names of victims, minors, or witnesses. | **Anonymization:** State if you used a tool (like Presidio) to redact PII, or justify why you didn't (e.g., "We filtered for Supreme Court cases only, which are highly public"). |
| **Contracts** (Proprietary) | **Copyright/Privilege:** Did you scrape generic web contracts or use a firm's private repository? | **Disclosure:** If using private firm data, you must state: "Data usage was authorized by [Firm Name] under a Data Use Agreement." |
| **Westlaw / Lexis** | **TOS Violation:** Scraping these sites is a Terms of Service violation. | **Rejection Trigger:** Do not admit to scraping these. Use **Free Law Project** or **Harvard Caselaw Access Project** instead. |

### **3. Artifact Adherence (Model & Data Release)**

For Legal AI, the **License** you choose for your artifacts is a major ethics signal.

*   **The "OpenRAIL" Requirement:**
    *   Do not use a standard MIT/Apache license.
    *   Use **OpenRAIL-M (Responsible AI License)**. This allows you to add specific behavioral restrictions (e.g., "You agree not to use this model to generate fake legal evidence").
*   **The Model Card:**
    *   Your repo *must* include a `MODEL_CARD.md`.
    *   **Specific Section:** "Out-of-Scope Use."
    *   *Example:* "This model is out-of-scope for use in automated judgment systems, bail determination, or generating legal filings without attorney supervision."

### **4. The Submission Checklist**

Before you submit to ACL/NeurIPS, check these boxes. If you miss one, you risk an "Ethics Flag."

**The "Do No Harm" Checks:**
*   [ ] **Hallucination Warning:** Does the abstract or conclusion admit the model creates fake facts?
*   [ ] **Temporal Cutoff:** Legal law changes. Did you state the training data cutoff? (e.g., "Trained on cases up to 2021; does not reflect the *Dobbs* decision").
*   [ ] **Jurisdiction:** Explicitly state the jurisdiction (e.g., "US Federal Law only"). A model trained on US law is dangerous if applied to UK law.

**The Privacy Checks:**
*   [ ] **PII Scrubbing:** Did you remove names from sensitive case types (Family Law, Asylum, Sexual Assault)?
*   [ ] **Consent:** If using specialized legal forums (e.g., r/legaladvice), did you anonymize usernames?

**The Compute Checks:**
*   [ ] **Carbon Footprint:** Standard for all AI papers.
*   [ ] **Access Disparity:** Acknowledge that large legal LLMs favor large law firms over public defenders.

### **5. Simulated Reviewer "Red Flags"**

Here is what an Ethics Reviewer (Reviewer 3) will say if you fail compliance:

> **Reviewer 3 (Ethics Flag):**
> "The authors propose a 'Legal Advisor' bot but fail to evaluate the risk of hallucinatory case law. Given the high stakes of legal reliance, releasing this model without a restrictive license or 'Human-in-the-Loop' constraints constitutes a significant safety risk. The paper also treats 'Law' as monolithic, failing to distinguish between Civil and Criminal liability risks."

**Fix:** Ensure your **Limitations** section explicitly addresses "Hallucination," "Jurisdiction," and "The need for Human Verification."
