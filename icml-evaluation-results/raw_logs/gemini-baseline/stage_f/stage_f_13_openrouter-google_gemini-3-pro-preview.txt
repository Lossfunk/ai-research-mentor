Here is a **12-15 minute conference slide outline** tailored for a **Trustworthy LLM Evaluation** paper (e.g., ACL, NeurIPS, FAccT).

This outline prioritizes **visual storytelling** over text and focuses heavily on the "Limitations" and "Future Work" sections, which are critical for establishing scientific credibility in the "Trustworthiness" domain.

### **Section 1: The Context & The Gap (2-3 Minutes)**

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Visual:** Title, Authors, Affiliations. A large QR code linking to the Paper + Code.
*   **Speaker Note:** "Hi, I'm [Name]. Today I’m presenting our work on [Project Name], a framework for rigorously auditing LLM reliability."

**Slide 2: The "Trust" Crisis**
*   **Visual:** A collage of 3 distinct failure modes (e.g., a Hallucination, a Jailbreak, and a Biased Output).
*   **Text:** "LLMs are capable, but are they reliable?"
*   **Key Point:** We have high benchmarks for *capability* (MMLU, GSM8K), but low standards for *trustworthiness*.

**Slide 3: The Problem with Current Evals**
*   **Visual:** A chart showing "Goodhart’s Law" (e.g., Safety scores rising while utility plummets, or benchmarks leaking into training data).
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   Static Benchmarks $\rightarrow$ Memorization.
    *   LLM-as-a-Judge $\rightarrow$ Self-preference bias.
    *   Single-metric myopia $\rightarrow$ Ignoring the safety-utility trade-off.
*   **The Hook:** "We need a dynamic, multi-faceted evaluation protocol."

### **Section 2: Contributions & Methodology (3-4 Minutes)**

**Slide 4: Our Contributions (The "Money" Slide)**
*   **Visual:** Three distinct icons representing your three main contributions.
*   **Content:**
    1.  **New Metric/Framework:** (e.g., "Probabilistic Safety Scores").
    2.  **Dataset:** (e.g., "Adversarial Stress-Test Set").
    3.  **Empirical Finding:** (e.g., "RLHF reduces toxicity but increases hallucination").

**Slide 5: The Methodology (System Diagram)**
*   **Visual:** A flow chart. Input Prompt $\rightarrow$ [Your Method/Intervention] $\rightarrow$ Evaluation Oracle.
*   **Key Focus:** Highlight the **"Adversarial"** or **"Robustness"** aspect. How do you ensure you aren't just measuring average-case performance?

**Slide 6: Defining "Trust" (The Taxonomy)**
*   **Visual:** A radar chart showing the axes you evaluated.
    *   *Axis 1:* Factuality.
    *   *Axis 2:* Safety/Toxicity.
    *   *Axis 3:* Robustness (to prompt injection).
    *   *Axis 4:* Fairness.
*   **Speaker Note:** "We move beyond single-score reporting. Trust is multi-dimensional."

### **Section 3: Key Results (3-4 Minutes)**

**Slide 7: Main Results (The Table)**
*   **Visual:** A clean table comparing your method/model against SOTA (GPT-4, Llama-3).
*   **Highlight:** **Bold** your best numbers. Use <span style="color:green">Green</span> for improvement and <span style="color:red">Red</span> for degradation.
*   **Narrative:** "We achieve X% higher safety with only Y% drop in helpfulness."

**Slide 8: The "Insight" Slide (Qualitative Analysis)**
*   **Visual:** Two side-by-side chat bubbles.
    *   *Left:* Baseline Model failing (e.g., falling for a jailbreak).
    *   *Right:* Your Model/Method resisting the attack.
*   **Speaker Note:** "Here is what the metrics look like in practice. Notice how the baseline fails to detect the nuanced injection..."

**Slide 9: Stress Testing (Robustness)**
*   **Visual:** A line graph showing performance degradation as "Attack Strength" or "Noise" increases.
*   **Takeaway:** "Our method maintains stability even under high-noise conditions, whereas baselines collapse."

### **Section 4: Limitations & Future Work (The "Science" Section)**
*This is where you win the reviewers' respect.*

**Slide 10: Limitations (Honest & Specific)**
*   **Visual:** A simple list, but phrased constructively.
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   **Proxy Limitations:** "We rely on [Model X] as a judge. While correlated with human judgment, it struggles with sarcasm/irony."
    *   **Scope of Harm:** "Our safety taxonomy covers 'Violent/Hateful' content but does not cover 'Disinformation' or 'Persuasion' risks."
    *   **Language Bias:** "Evaluation was conducted strictly in English; cultural nuances in safety may not transfer."

**Slide 11: Future Work (The Roadmap)**
*   **Visual:** A timeline or branching path graphics.
*   **Ideas:**
    *   **Red Teaming Automation:** "Moving from static datasets to agent-based red teaming."
    *   **Multimodal Trust:** "Extending these metrics to Vision-Language Models (VLMs)."
    *   **Mechanistic Interpretability:** "Understanding *where* in the network the safety refusal is triggered."

### **Section 5: Conclusion (1 Minute)**

**Slide 12: Summary & Impact**
*   **Visual:** The "Radar Chart" from Slide 6 again, but filled in with your results.
*   **Takeaways:**
    1.  Trustworthiness must be measured under adversarial pressure.
    2.  [Your Method] provides a more granular view of model risks.
    3.  Open Source: "We believe in transparent evaluation."

**Slide 13: Q&A / Resources**
*   **Visual:**
    *   Large QR Code (Link to GitHub).
    *   Link to Hugging Face Collection.
    *   Contact Info (Twitter/X, Email).
*   **Text:** "Thank you! The benchmark code and datasets are available now."

### **Speaker Tips for "Trustworthy AI" Talks**

1.  **Don't Overclaim:** Never say "We solved safety." Say "We improved safety robustness by X%."
2.  **Define Your Terms:** If you say "Hallucination," define if you mean "Fabrication" (making things up) or "Unfaithfulness" (ignoring the context).
3.  **The "Vibes" Defense:** Expect questions about whether your automated metrics align with human preference. Have a backup slide (Slide 14) showing your **Human Correlation Study** results.
