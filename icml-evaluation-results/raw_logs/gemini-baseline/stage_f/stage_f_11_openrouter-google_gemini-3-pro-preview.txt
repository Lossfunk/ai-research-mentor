For a **Sustainable AI / Optimization** project (e.g., pruning, quantization, efficient attention), your dissemination plan must prove two things: **Verifyability** (can others reproduce your efficiency claims?) and **Usability** (is it actually cheaper to run?).

Here is the comprehensive dissemination plan.

---

### **1. Licensing Strategy**
*Choose licenses that maximize adoption while respecting upstream constraints.*

*   **Code (The Optimizer):** **Apache 2.0**.
    *   *Why:* It allows commercial use and patent grants, which is critical if you want industry engineers (at Hugging Face, NVIDIA, etc.) to integrate your optimization methods.
*   **Models (The Compressed Weights):** **Inherited License** OR **OpenRAIL-M**.
    *   *Constraint:* If you compressed Llama-3, you *must* use the Llama-3 Community License.
    *   *If novel:* Use OpenRAIL-M to restrict malicious use while allowing open research.
*   **Dataset (The Benchmarks/Logs):** **CC-BY 4.0**.
    *   *Context:* If you are releasing a dataset of "Energy consumption logs" or "Latency profiles," this allows free use with attribution.

---

### **2. Repository Structure & Artifacts**
*Optimization papers live or die by their reproduction scripts.*

**GitHub Structure:**
```text
/benchmarks       # Scripts to reproduce Table 1 (Latency/Energy)
   /hardware_configs  # Specific flags for A100 vs. Raspberry Pi
/src              # The core optimization library
/docker           # MANDATORY for efficiency papers (standardizes CUDA versions)
CARBON.md         # Full disclosure of training energy cost (The "Green Bill")
EMISSIONS.md      # Auto-generated logs from CodeCarbon or Carbontracker
README.md
LICENSE
```

**Hugging Face (HF) Collections:**
*   Create a **Collection** named `[Project Name] - Sustainable Suite`.
*   Include:
    1.  **The Base Model:** (For comparison).
    2.  **The Pruned/Quantized Models:** (The artifacts).
    3.  **The Evaluation Dataset:** (If you created a specific efficiency benchmark).

### **3. The "Sustainable" README Structure**
*Standard READMEs are not enough. You need to sell the "Green" angle immediately.*

*   **Header:** Project Title + Badges (License, Python Version, **Carbon Cost**).
*   **The "Pareto Plot" (Crucial):**
    *   *Visual:* A line graph showing Accuracy (Y-axis) vs. Inference Cost/Energy (X-axis). Show your method dominating the Pareto frontier compared to baselines.
*   **Quick Start (Low Resource):**
    *   *Code:* `pip install your-lib`
    *   *Demo:* Show it running on a **CPU** or **Colab Free Tier**. If it requires an A100 to run the demo, you contradict your "Sustainable" message.
*   **Hardware Matrix:**
    *   Table listing: `Device | RAM Usage | Latency (ms) | Energy (J/token)`
*   **Environmental Statement:**
    *   "Training this model emitted approx. X kg CO2eq. However, using this model reduces inference emissions by Y% compared to [Baseline]."

---

### **4. Community & Dissemination Channels**

**Phase 1: The "Hardcore" Optimization Crowd**
*   **Reddit:** Post to `r/LocalLLaMA` and `r/MachineLearning`.
    *   *Hook:* "We quantized [Model X] to 2-bit with only 1% acc loss. Runs on a MacBook Air." (Optimization communities care about running things locally).
*   **Twitter/X:** Tag key efficiency influencers (e.g., Tim Dettmers, Hugging Face optimization team). Use tags `#GreenAI` `#TinyML` `#EdgeAI`.

**Phase 2: The Academic/Green Crowd**
*   **Climate Change AI (CCAI):** Submit a blog post or summary to the CCAI community forum/newsletter.
*   **PapersWithCode:** Submit a pull request to link your code to the paper. **Create a new Leaderboard** for "Efficiency on Task X" if one doesn't exist.

**Phase 3: The Developer Ecosystem**
*   **Hugging Face Spaces:** Create a live Gradio demo.
    *   *Feature:* Add a "Real-time Energy Monitor" widget to the demo (calculating joules per query). This visualizes your contribution perfectly.

### **5. Release Timeline (2-Week Sprint)**

| Day | Task | Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon** | **Dockerize** | Ensure the `Dockerfile` builds. If a user spends 4 hours installing CUDA, they will abandon your "efficient" project. |
| **Wed** | **Carbon Audit** | Finalize `CARBON.md`. Use the "Machine Learning Emissions Calculator" to generate the certificate. |
| **Fri** | **HF Upload** | Upload models to Hugging Face. **Tag them correctly:** `green-ai`, `efficiency`, `quantization`. |
| **Mon** | **Soft Launch** | Send the repo to 3 colleagues to test the "Quick Start." Fix bugs. |
| **Wed** | **Public Launch** | Make repo Public. Tweet. Post to Reddit. Update ArXiv with the code link. |
| **Fri** | **Integration** | (Bonus) Open a PR to a larger library (e.g., `transformers`, `bitsandbytes`) to add your method as a feature. |

### **Final Check: The "Greenwashing" Trap**
**Do not** claim "Zero Carbon."
**Do** claim "Carbon Efficient."
Ensure your `CARBON.md` admits the cost of your research. Transparency is the currency of trust in the Green AI community.
