Based on a 6-month project scope focusing on **Compressible LLMs** (e.g., quantization, pruning, distillation, or efficient architecture), the ideal venues are those that accept **Short Papers** (typically 4 pages) or have specific tracks for efficiency, as 6 months is often a tight timeline for a full-scale 8+ page analysis.

Here are the top recommendations with specific constraints and a simulated review.

### **Top Venue Recommendations**

#### **1. EMNLP 2025 (Short Paper Track)**
*   **Why:** The premier venue for NLP. The "Short Paper" track is designed for focused contributions (e.g., a specific compression technique or negative result) perfect for a 6-month scope.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Submission:** Via **ACL Rolling Review (ARR)**. The **May 19, 2025** cycle is the prime target to be considered for EMNLP 2025 (held in November).
    *   **Commitment Deadline:** Likely August 2025 (after receiving ARR reviews).
*   **Formatting Constraints:**
    *   **Length:** Max **4 pages** of content (excluding references/appendix).
    *   **Style:** ACL LaTeX template (two-column).
    *   **Anonymity:** Double-blind (must anonymize GitHub repos and self-citations).
*   **Ethics Constraints:**
    *   **Mandatory Ethics Statement:** You must discuss the broader impacts. For "Compressible LLMs," this specifically includes **Environmental Impact** (compute saved vs. compute used for compression) and **Fairness** (does compression disproportionately degrade performance on minority dialects/languages?).

#### **2. COLM 2025 (Conference on Language Modeling)**
*   **Why:** A newer, high-impact venue specifically for LLM research. It attracts specialized reviewers who understand the nuances of compression better than general ML reviewers.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Abstract Deadline:** **March 22, 2025**.
    *   **Full Paper:** **March 28, 2025**. (Note: If your project is just starting *now*, this is too soon. If you are finishing *now*, this is the best immediate target).
*   **Formatting Constraints:**
    *   **Length:** Typically 9 pages (main track), but concise papers are accepted if the contribution is clear. *Note: COLM is single-track and competitive; a 6-month project might need to be framed very tightly.*
*   **Ethics Constraints:**
    *   Strong focus on **Safety and Alignment**. You must address if your compression technique removes safety guardrails (e.g., "jailbreaking via quantization").

#### **3. NeurIPS 2025 Workshops (e.g., Efficient Natural Language and Speech Processing)**
*   **Why:** If the main conference deadlines are missed or the scope is smaller, NeurIPS workshops are prestigious and perfect for "work in progress" or smaller complete projects.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Submission:** Typically **September 2025** (Conference in December).
*   **Formatting Constraints:**
    *   **Length:** Often **4-8 pages** (flexible).
    *   **Style:** NeurIPS LaTeX template.
*   **Ethics Constraints:**
    *   **NeurIPS Checklist:** Rigorous checklist required regarding compute resources, carbon footprint, and dataset consent.

### **Simulated Reviewer Summary**

**Context:** This is a simulation of "Reviewer 2" for a Short Paper submission to EMNLP titled *"SparseQuant: 4-bit Post-Training Quantization for LLaMA-3 with Minimal Perplexity Loss."*

> **Reviewer 2 (Score: 3.5/5 - Borderline Accept)**
>
> **Summary:** The authors propose a new post-training quantization method that utilizes sparse matrices to retain outliers in 4-bit weights. They demonstrate a 15% inference speedup on LLaMA-3-8B with negligible perplexity degradation on WikiText-2.
>
> **Strengths:**
> *   **Relevance:** Efficient LLM inference is a timely and critical topic.
> *   **Clarity:** The method is explained clearly, and the 4-page scope is well-utilized; the ablation study on sparsity thresholds is insightful.
>
> **Weaknesses & Questions:**
> *   **Evaluation Gap:** While perplexity is stable, the paper fails to evaluate **downstream task performance** (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K). It is well-known that compression can hurt reasoning capabilities even if perplexity remains low.
> *   **Real-world Latency:** The reported "15% speedup" seems to be theoretical FLOPs reduction. Did the authors measure wall-clock time on actual hardware (e.g., A100 vs. Edge device)? Sparse kernels often have overhead that negates theoretical gains.
> *   **Ethics/Impact:** The ethics statement claims "energy savings," but does not account for the energy cost of the search phase required to find the sparse mask.
>
> **Recommendation:** The method is promising, but I cannot recommend acceptance without at least one zero-shot reasoning benchmark to prove the model hasn't become "dumber" despite good perplexity.

### **Strategic Advice for Your Project**
1.  **Focus on Downstream Tasks:** Do not just report Perplexity. For a 6-month project, pick 2-3 key benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HellaSwag) to prove the model is still usable.
2.  **Hardware Verification:** If you claim "efficiency," you *must* show real latency numbers (ms/token) on specific hardware, not just parameter counts.
3.  **Ethics of Compression:** Explicitly check if your compression makes the model more biased. (e.g., *"Does 4-bit quantization hurt performance on African American English more than Standard American English?"*). Addressing this will make your paper stand out in the Ethics review.
