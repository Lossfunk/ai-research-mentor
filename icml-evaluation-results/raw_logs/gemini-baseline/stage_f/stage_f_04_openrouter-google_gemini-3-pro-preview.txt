Since your paper is titled **"Do Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) Models Transfer?"**, you are likely targeting either **General ML** (NeurIPS/ICLR) or **Medical Imaging/Computer Vision** (MICCAI/CVPR).

These venues have drastically different definitions of "pages" and "artifacts." Here is the venue map and your adapted execution plan.

### **1. The Venue Map: Constraints & Expectations**

| Feature | **NeurIPS / ICLR (General ML)** | **MICCAI (Medical AI)** | **CVPR / ICCV (Vision)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Page Limit** | **9 pages** (content) + unlimited refs/appendix. | **10-13 pages** (approx. 8.5 text) **INCLUDING** refs. *Strict.* | **8 pages** (content) + unlimited refs. |
| **Format** | Two-column (Standard LaTeX). | **LNCS** (Single column, wide margins). *Warning: Eats up space fast.* | Two-column (IEEE style). |
| **Anonymity** | **Double-Blind.** Strict. | **Double-Blind.** Very Strict. | **Double-Blind.** |
| **Code Policy** | **Highly Recommended.** Submit via Anonymous GitHub or zip. | **Encouraged.** "Reproducibility" is a review criterion. | **Expected.** |
| **Data Policy** | Must use public benchmarks or disclose private data details. | **Strict.** Private data requires ethics statement & access details. | Standard. |
| **"Transfer" Expectation** | Focus on **Theory/Generalization**. *Why* does it transfer? | Focus on **Clinical Utility**. Does it work on *external* hospitals? | Focus on **Visuals/Features**. Show the feature shift. |

### **2. Artifact Strategy: The "Transfer" Evidence**
For a paper about *Transferability*, your artifacts are the primary evidence. Reviewers will be skeptical that your results are just "lucky seeds."

**A. The Code Artifact (Anonymized)**
*   **The Trap:** Linking to your personal GitHub in the paper.
*   **The Fix:** Use [Anonymous GitHub](https://anonymous.github.io/) or submit a `.zip` file.
*   **Content:**
    *   `train_source.py` (Training on Domain A)
    *   `eval_target.py` (Zero-shot or Fine-tune on Domain B)
    *   `config/` (Hyperparameters—crucial for MIL as bag sizes change results).

**B. The Model Weights (Crucial for Transfer)**
*   **Requirement:** Since you claim transferability, you should provide the **Pre-trained Encoders** (or MIL aggregators) trained on the Source Domain.
*   **Host:** Upload weights to an anonymous google drive or OpenReview attachment.
*   **Why:** It allows reviewers to verify your "Zero-Shot" claims immediately without retraining.

**C. The Data Manifest**
*   **Risk:** If using medical data (e.g., TCGA), you cannot upload the images.
*   **The Fix:** Upload a **CSV Manifest** containing: `slide_id`, `label`, `split (train/test)`, and `source_site`. This proves you didn't bleed test data into training (data leakage).

### **3. Adapted 8-Week Plan (Venue-Specific)**

**Phase 1: The "Format Crunch" (Weeks 1-2)**
*   **Decision Point:** Choose your venue NOW.
    *   *If MICCAI:* Download the **Springer LNCS template**. You will realize you have 30% less space than you thought. You must cut your "Related Work" significantly.
    *   *If NeurIPS:* You have space. Expand the "Ablation Studies" section.
*   **Action:** Paste your current draft into the target LaTeX template.
    *   *Red Flag:* If you are 2 pages over the limit, cut the "Background on MIL" section. Assume the reviewer knows what Attention MIL is.

**Phase 2: The "Reproducibility Audit" (Weeks 3-5)**
*   **Task:** Can a stranger run your transfer experiment?
*   **Test:** Delete your local `__pycache__` and environment. Clone your own anonymous repo. Run `eval_target.py`.
*   **Fix:** If it crashes or requires a hardcoded path (`/home/user/data`), fix it now.

**Phase 3: The "Blindness Check" (Week 6)**
*   **Search & Destroy:**
    *   "As we showed in [Citation of your previous paper]..." $\rightarrow$ **CHANGE TO:** "As shown in [Citation]..."
    *   "We collected data from [Your University Name]..." $\rightarrow$ **CHANGE TO:** "We collected data from [Institution A]..."
    *   Check figure metadata (sometimes PDF figures contain author names in metadata).

**Phase 4: Submission Packaging (Week 7-8)**
*   **The Appendix:** Move all "Hyperparameter Search" and "Additional t-SNE plots" here.
*   **The Checklist:**
    *   *NeurIPS:* Fill out the mandatory NeurIPS Paper Checklist.
    *   *Code:* Verify the Anonymous GitHub link is live and does not 404.

### **4. Missing Items Checklist (Specific to MIL Transfer)**

Add these to your paper to meet artifact expectations:

1.  **[ ] Bag-Size Distribution Plot:** In the Appendix, show the histogram of bag sizes for Domain A vs. Domain B. (Transfer often fails because Domain B has smaller bags/fewer instances).
2.  **[ ] Feature Extractor Disclosure:** Explicitly state: "We used ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet (or MoCo/SimCLR on Pathology)." Transfer performance is heavily dependent on the frozen encoder.
3.  **[ ] The "Negative Transfer" Baseline:** You must report a case where transfer *failed* (e.g., Random Initialization). This anchors your results.

**Which venue are you leaning toward?** I can give you the specific LaTeX command hacks to save space for that specific template.
