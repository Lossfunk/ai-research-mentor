Below is a concise, venue‑agnostic final submission checklist for a privacy‑preserving NLP paper, with emphasis on artifact requirements, ethics/compliance statements, and a six‑week timeline with concrete checkpoints and go/no‑go gates. Adapt page limits and minor details to your target venue (ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS/ACL).

Final submission checklist

Scope, claims, and threat model
- [ ] Clearly define threat model(s): what attackers can access (black/white‑box, data/model, gradients, prompts), and what is out of scope.
- [ ] Precisely state privacy mechanism(s): DP‑SGD/PATE/federated learning/secure aggregation/TEE/synthetic data, etc.
- [ ] If claiming differential privacy:
  - [ ] Report ε, δ, privacy accountant type (RDP/moments), composition method, sampling scheme, clipping norm, noise multiplier, lot size, steps.
  - [ ] State population size and per‑record participation bounds; clarify per‑example vs per‑sample DP.
  - [ ] Provide privacy–utility trade‑off curves (varying ε), not only point estimates.
- [ ] Provide non‑private and privacy‑weakened baselines for context.

Data, provenance, and licensing
- [ ] List all datasets with URLs, licenses, permitted uses, and redistribution stance; include a provenance appendix.
- [ ] Confirm data access terms/TOS; do not mirror restricted data. Provide fetch scripts or instructions instead.
- [ ] For any human/sensitive data: de‑identification status, consent/IRB determination, DUAs, takedown policy.
- [ ] Describe pre‑processing/tokenization; state how PII was detected, filtered, and residual risks.

Experiments and evaluations
- [ ] Utility metrics appropriate to task(s) (e.g., accuracy/F1/ROUGE/BLEU/perplexity, calibration).
- [ ] Privacy audits:
  - [ ] Membership inference attacks (black‑box and, if relevant, white‑box); report attack advantage/TPR@FPR with CIs.
  - [ ] Canaries/rare sequence exposure tests; exposure metrics versus private and non‑private models.
  - [ ] Attribute inference or text reconstruction where applicable.
- [ ] Robustness and ablations: ε sweeps; clipping norm sensitivity; micro‑batching; optimizer variants; data subsampling; FL/secure‑agg toggles.
- [ ] Fairness/representation: subgroup metrics if data has groups/languages; discuss trade‑offs induced by privacy.
- [ ] Repeated runs with fixed seeds; report confidence intervals and statistical tests.

Reproducibility, compute, and environment
- [ ] Full hyperparameters, seeds, data splits, early‑stopping rules, and exact preprocessing.
- [ ] Hardware/software disclosure: accelerators, memory, interconnect, OS, framework versions, determinism flags.
- [ ] Compute and environmental accounting: accelerator‑hours per experiment, kWh/CO2e with region/intensity factors and tool used (e.g., CodeCarbon).

Writing, formatting, and compliance
- [ ] Double‑blind anonymization (if applicable): artifacts anonymized; no self‑identifying text/metadata.
- [ ] Limitations section: residual leakage risks, known failure modes, applicability boundaries.
- [ ] Ethics statement (see scaffold below) aligned with venue requirements.
- [ ] Venue reproducibility checklist completed and cross‑checked.

Release strategy
- [ ] Decide artifact release mode consistent with privacy and licenses: code + configs + attack scripts; weights (DP‑trained) vs gated access vs evaluation‑only; weight deltas if base model license restricts redistribution.
- [ ] Choose license(s) and acceptable‑use policy; provide model and data cards.
- [ ] Vulnerability disclosure contact and takedown procedure.

Artifact requirements (what to include)

Repository and environment
- [ ] Clean, anonymous repo (or private link for review) with:
  - [ ] Reproducible environment (Conda/Poetry + lockfile) and optional Docker image.
  - [ ] SBOM/dependency and license inventory; LICENSE and CITATION files.
  - [ ] One‑command runners for each main table/figure; Makefile or scripts.
- [ ] Configs as code: YAML/TOML with all hyperparams, seeds, clipping/noise, batch/lot sizes, steps, sampling scheme.

Privacy accounting and logs
- [ ] Accountant code and logs proving reported ε, δ; specify accountant flavor and composition; serialize a privacy ledger per run.
- [ ] Sanitized training logs (no text snippets/PII); show loss curves and gradient clipping statistics.

Data handling
- [ ] Data‑fetch scripts pointing to official sources; checksums for expected files.
- [ ] If data can’t be shared: small synthetic/mock datasets to validate pipelines; redaction recipes; clear notes on how to obtain restricted data.

Models and checkpoints
- [ ] DP‑trained checkpoints if release is acceptable; otherwise weight deltas or evaluation API with rate limits.
- [ ] Baseline non‑private models for comparison (if licenses permit).

Evaluation and attack suite
- [ ] Scripts/notebooks for:
  - [ ] Membership inference (shadow models or reference‑free methods), with reproducible splits.
  - [ ] Canary insertion and exposure measurement.
  - [ ] Attribute inference (if applicable).
  - [ ] Utility metrics and calibration.
- [ ] Confidence interval scripts; fixed seeds; random state control.

Documentation
- [ ] README with exact commands, expected runtime/hardware, and how to reproduce every result.
- [ ] Model card: intended use, limitations, training data summary, DP parameters, safety considerations.
- [ ] Data card(s): provenance, licensing, consent/de‑ID, access, known issues.
- [ ] Risk log: known vulnerabilities and mitigations; acceptable‑use policy.

Ethics statement scaffold (adapt to your paper)

- Data provenance and licensing
  - We list all datasets, sources, and licenses in Appendix X. We access data only under the original terms and do not redistribute restricted content. Preprocessing includes PII filtering via [methods], with residual risks discussed below.
- Human subjects and consent
  - [No new human data collected]/[IRB protocol #…; category (approved/exempt); informed consent obtained; fair compensation and demographic handling described in Appendix Y].
- Privacy guarantees and residual risk
  - We train with [DP‑SGD/PATE/FL+secure aggregation/TEE], targeting ε=…, δ=…, measured using [RDP/moments] accounting with [sampling scheme]. We evaluate leakage with membership and canary exposure tests; results indicate [summary]. Residual risks include [e.g., group‑specific leakage, out‑of‑distribution prompts]; we advise against [uses] and provide an appropriate release policy.
- Safety, fairness, and misuse
  - We report subgroup performance and discuss privacy–utility trade‑offs. We publish an acceptable‑use policy and a vulnerability disclosure contact. Known failure modes: [list].
- Environmental impact
  - Training consumed ~[GPU‑hours], ≈[kWh] and [kgCO2e] in region [R] using [tool/method]. We used efficiency measures [mixed precision/gradient accumulation/low‑bit inference].

Six‑week timeline with checkpoints and go/no‑go gates

Week 6 (T–6 weeks): Scope lock and templates
- Lock venue(s), page budget, and templates; set up anonymous artifact skeleton.
- Finalize threat model and privacy mechanism(s); define target ε, δ and primary endpoints.
- Go/no‑go gate: Feasible ε, δ with available compute; data access and licenses cleared.

Week 5: Core experiments and accounting
- Run primary utility baselines (non‑private) and first DP runs; enable privacy ledger/accountant logging.
- Implement attack suite (membership, canaries) and validate on small runs.
- Draft provenance appendix and ethics statement sections.
- Checkpoint: First ε, δ achieved; preliminary privacy–utility curve.

Week 4: Sweeps, audits, and documentation
- Complete ε and clipping sweeps; stabilize training; run repeated trials for CIs.
- Execute full privacy audits (MIA, canaries, attribute inference if applicable).
- Draft Results, Limitations, Ethics; start README and run scripts; add model/data cards.
- Go/no‑go gate: Privacy audits do not show unacceptable leakage (predefine thresholds, e.g., MIA advantage ≤ X%).

Week 3: Reproducibility and compliance
- Finalize tables/figures; compute/CO2 estimates; pin environment and container.
- Anonymization pass for paper and artifacts; fill venue reproducibility checklist.
- External dry‑run review for privacy/compliance wording; fix risky assets or claims.
- Checkpoint: Fresh‑machine reproduction of at least one end‑to‑end run.

Week 2: Artifact hardening and paper freeze v1
- Freeze main text within page limits; push details to appendix.
- Complete attack scripts, accountant artifacts, and provenance appendix; add SBOM and licenses.
- Tag anonymous artifact release; verify deterministic runs and seeds.
- Go/no‑go gate: All main results reproducible via one‑command scripts; ε, δ and audit numbers match the paper.

Week 1 (T–7 to T–3 days): Polish and validation
- Tighten claims; finalize captions and limitations; proof for consistency.
- Final compliance sweep: IRB/DUA text, TOS/license checks, takedown and disclosure policies.
- Re‑run a subset of audits on the release checkpoints to confirm numbers.

Submission week (T–2 to T–0 days)
- Final anonymization and formatting checks; embed fonts; verify references.
- Submit paper + supplement; provide anonymous artifact link and any required forms.
- Archive commit hashes, privacy ledgers, and environment digests.

Common last‑minute pitfalls to avoid
- Reporting ε without δ or without specifying accountant/sampling assumptions.
- Incomplete or non‑reproducible attack pipelines; missing seeds/CIs.
- Training logs leaking snippets of raw text; sanitize before release.
- Redistributing restricted datasets or non‑compliant model derivatives; prefer fetch scripts or weight deltas.
- Overclaiming privacy guarantees beyond the stated threat model.

If you share your target venue and whether you use DP‑SGD, FL, or another mechanism, I can tailor the checklist with exact section/page budgets, venue‑specific ethics prompts, and a minimal artifact template (repo layout, Makefile, and accountant/attack stubs).
