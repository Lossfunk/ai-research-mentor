Here’s a focused two-week sprint plan to polish the camera-ready version of your graph foundation models paper, with day-by-day tasks, artifact packaging, licensing, and release notes. Adjust sequencing to your actual deadline and venue requirements.

Assumptions
- You will release: code, configs, pretrained weights, evaluation scripts, and de-identified/synthetic samples (not full datasets if licenses restrict).
- Targets: GitHub (or equivalent), Zenodo DOI, and optional Hugging Face model hub.

Two-week sprint (Day 1–14)

Day 1: Scope lock and checklist setup
- Lock camera-ready requirements (template, page limits, forms) and artifact expectations (code+weights+eval).
- Create a tracked checklist (issues/milestones) for all items below with owners and deadlines.
- Decide release versioning (v1.0.0 for camera-ready) and artifact channels (GitHub, HF, Zenodo).

Day 2: Reproducibility backbone
- Map every main table/figure to a config and command; create reproduce.sh/make targets.
- Fix random seeds; record dataset split seeds and hashing method for integrity.
- Add a results manifest (CSV/JSON): figure/table → config ID → seed → expected metrics ± CI.

Day 3: Environment and container
- Pin dependencies (Conda/Poetry lockfile) and create a Docker image (CPU and optional GPU).
- Add determinism flags and document them (framework, CUDA/cuDNN, PyTorch flags).
- Fresh-machine smoke test for one end-to-end run (simulated or small).

Day 4: Model and feature packaging (graph-specific)
- Package pretrained weights: safe format (e.g., safetensors + PyTorch state_dict), plus config.json (architecture, dims, heads, positional enc/PE, tokenizer/featurizer versions).
- Include graph featurization pipeline (node/edge attributes, positional encodings, Laplacian/PE seeds) with a single function/API.
- Provide task adapters/heads (node/edge/graph-level) and inference scripts; save precomputed embeddings for at least one benchmark to reduce compute.

Day 5: Dataset provenance and scripts
- Build data-fetch scripts that pull from official sources (e.g., OGB) and do not mirror restricted data.
- Create a data card: dataset names, URLs, licenses, redistribution stance, known issues; document split strategies (random, scaffold, time-based).
- Add integrity checks (checksums) and a failure-safe path for missing assets.

Day 6: Licensing and policy
- Select licenses:
  - Code: Apache-2.0 or MIT (unless dependencies force otherwise).
  - Model weights: RAIL or custom acceptable-use license if risk-sensitive; otherwise Apache-2.0 if permissible.
  - Data: No redistribution; document original licenses and require users to fetch themselves.
- Generate LICENSE files for code and weights, plus a dependency license inventory (e.g., pip-licenses/scancode).
- Add an acceptable-use policy and disclaimer (e.g., not for clinical/regulated use).

Day 7: Documentation and cards
- README: quickstart, install, one-command reproduction, hardware/expected runtime, links to paper and DOI.
- Model card: training data summary, objectives, architecture, intended use, limitations, risks, eval metrics, compute/CO2 estimates.
- Data card(s): provenance/licensing, preprocessing, splits, known biases.
- Add CITATION.cff and a BibTeX entry; include acknowledgments/funding in repo (even if omitted in the paper).

Day 8: Evaluation harness and CI
- Standardize evaluation metrics across tasks (node, edge, graph) and add confidence intervals.
- Add a simple CI to test import, smoke runs, lint, and docs build.
- Re-run primary results with final configs; store logs and metrics; update manifest.

Day 9: Camera-ready paper polish
- Final edit for clarity and consistency with artifacts; update method details to match released configs.
- Verify figure resolution, fonts, references, and required statements (ethics/limitations, reproducibility).
- Update supplementary with precise commands, seeds, and links (anonymous or named per venue).

Day 10: Security/privacy and quality pass
- Scrub logs, notebooks, and configs for secrets or PII; remove any path/usernames in code/comments.
- Verify weight files and sample data contain no proprietary content.
- Add SBOM (optional) and a SECURITY.md with contact for vulnerability disclosure.

Day 11: Release engineering
- Tag v1.0.0; prepare GitHub Release draft with checksums (SHA256) for weights and key assets.
- Build and test PyPI package (if releasing a library) and publish Docker image to a registry.
- Prepare Zenodo sandbox draft to auto-mint DOI from GitHub release; confirm metadata.

Day 12: Publish artifacts
- Publish GitHub Release (attach weights, small sample data, container digest).
- Push models to Hugging Face hub with a populated model card and inference examples.
- Mint Zenodo DOI; update README, model card, and paper with the DOI and links.

Day 13: Final QA and link freeze
- Fresh-machine reproducibility using the public artifacts for at least one main result.
- Link checker across paper and README; repair 404s/permissions.
- Finalize release notes and known issues; open a “post-camera” roadmap issue.

Day 14: Submit camera-ready
- Submit final PDF and supplementary; fill any camera-ready forms (e.g., copyright).
- Archive the exact commit, container digest, and checksums; export a zipped “AE bundle” if the venue supports artifact evaluation.

Artifact packaging checklist (graph FM-focused)
- Repo structure
  - src/ (library code); scripts/ (train/eval); configs/ (YAML/TOML per experiment); notebooks/ (optional demos)
  - data_scripts/ (fetch/prep); models/ (weights+configs or pointers); docs/; tests/
- Reproducibility
  - reproduce.sh/make targets; results manifest; fixed seeds; logging of config+git commit+env hash
- Models
  - Weights (safetensors); config.json; adapter heads; feature pipeline; versioned artifact names
- Datasets
  - Fetch scripts; license headers; split seeds; integrity checks
- Environment
  - conda.yml/poetry.lock; Dockerfile; determinism flags; minimal and full env variants
- Evaluation
  - Task-agnostic evaluator (node/edge/graph); metrics with CIs; plotting scripts
- Docs
  - README, Model/Data cards, CITATION.cff, LICENSE(s), acceptable-use policy, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md (optional)
- Metadata
  - Checksums; model and dataset manifests; CHANGELOG.md; release notes

Licensing audit checklist
- Inventory third-party licenses; confirm no copyleft code (e.g., GPL) conflicts with your chosen license.
- Validate dataset licenses; exclude or gate assets with restrictive terms; state non-redistribution clearly.
- Ensure base model licenses allow redistribution of derivatives; if not, provide weight deltas + instructions.

If you share your target venue and which graph backbones you’re releasing (e.g., GraphTransformer/GraphGPS/GNN variants) I can tailor the configs, evaluator defaults, and model card sections, and draft a ready-to-ship README with exact reproduction commands for your tables.
