Below is a step-by-step, conference-ready publishing playbook for a cross-lingual dialogue paper. It covers camera-ready preparation, artifact packaging, archival uploads (code/models/datasets), and required disclosure statements. Adapt specifics to your venue (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/CoNLL/NeurIPS D&B/ICLR).

Phase 1 — Camera-ready planning (Day 1–2)
- Confirm venue requirements
  - Page limits, style file version, reference limits, appendix policy.
  - Mandatory sections/forms: Ethics statement, Limitations, Responsible NLP/ARR checklist (ACL venues), Data/Software/Model Availability statements, Reproducibility checklist (if required).
- Scope and claims lock
  - Finalize supported languages/dialects (ISO 639-3 + script codes), domains (task-oriented, open-domain), and dialogue modalities (text-only vs speech).
  - Decide what will be released: code, evaluation harness, pretrained models, datasets or fetch scripts, demo.
- Anonymization status
  - If camera-ready is de-anonymized: restore author names, affiliations, funding, IRB info, non-anonymous links.
  - If still anonymized (rare at camera-ready): keep anonymous links and remove identifiers.

Phase 2 — Camera-ready paper polish (Day 3–5)
- Text and figures
  - Align paper with artifacts (metrics, model names, decoding params, seeds).
  - Ensure Unicode fonts for non-Latin scripts (CJK/RTL support), correct diacritics, and directionality; embed all fonts; add alt-text for key figures.
  - Present bilingual examples responsibly (mask PII, avoid slurs except in toxicity tests with warnings).
- Methods disclosure (cross-lingual specifics)
  - Tokenization/segmentation per language; normalization (NFC/NFKC), romanization/transliteration if used.
  - Translation handling: human vs machine translation; quality control (BLEU/COMET, back-translation spot checks); annotator language proficiency.
  - Dialogue-specific: turn segmentation, code-switch handling, context window, speaker tags, de-duplication across languages.
  - Train/val/test split policy to avoid translation leakage (e.g., same source dialogue or translation pair cannot appear across splits).
- Results and robustness
  - Per-language metrics with CIs; macro- vs micro-averaging rationale.
  - OOD tests: new domains/dialects, low-resource languages; ablations on translation noise and tokenization.
- Accessibility and compliance
  - Colorblind-safe palettes; readable font sizes; equation/figure labeling.
  - PDF metadata set (title, authors, keywords); check for hidden identifiers in properties if still anonymized.

Phase 3 — Artifact packaging (Day 4–7)
- Repository and environment
  - Structure: src/, scripts/, configs/, data_scripts/, models/ (pointers), notebooks/, docs/, env/ (conda.yml + lockfile; Dockerfile), tests/.
  - One-command runners mapping each table/figure to configs; results manifest (table/figure → config → seed → expected metric ± CI).
  - Determinism flags and logging (framework seeds, CUDA/cuDNN behavior).
- Evaluation harness (multilingual)
  - Standardized I/O for dialogue datasets (turns, speakers, language tags).
  - Metrics: task metrics (BLEU/ROUGE/BERTScore for gen; accuracy/F1 for intent/slot), dialogue metrics (success/turns), calibration, safety/toxicity for each language (with locale-aware lexicons where applicable).
  - Robustness: paraphrase/perturbation tests, code-switch stress tests, translation noise sensitivity.
- Models and demos
  - Release checkpoints (or weight deltas if base license restricts) with config.json (tokenizer, vocab, special tokens, language adapters).
  - Inference script supporting language flags and right-to-left rendering; example prompts.
  - Optional Space/Colab demo with language picker and content warnings.
- Datasets
  - If licensing allows: host on a data hub with versioned parquet/jsonl and language/script fields; otherwise provide fetch scripts and preprocessing.
  - Data card with provenance, licenses, consent, de-identification, and known biases. Include language coverage table (ISO-639-3, script, dialect).
  - PII handling: documented redaction pipeline; profanity/toxicity filtering policy; code-switched examples reviewed.
- Documentation
  - README quickstart; per-language caveats; how to reproduce each result; hardware/time expectations.
  - Model cards and data cards; LANGUAGE_COVERAGE.md; EVALUATION.md with metrics and CIs.
- Licensing
  - Code: MIT or Apache-2.0.
  - Models: Apache-2.0 if permitted or Responsible AI License (RAIL)-style with use restrictions (no legal/medical advice; content moderation recommended).
  - Data: CC BY 4.0/CC BY-NC 4.0 for original; for third-party, no redistribution—provide fetch scripts and license notes.
  - Dependency license inventory (LICENSES/), CITATION.cff, NOTICE (if required).

Phase 4 — Legal, privacy, and ethics review (Day 6–8)
- Rights and TOS
  - Verify dataset licenses, site TOS, and any API terms for translations; remove assets with incompatible terms.
- Human subjects
  - IRB/ethics determination; consent and pay rates for annotators; language proficiency screening; debriefing materials.
- Privacy and safety
  - Confirm PII removal; manual spot checks for all languages/scripts; takedown policy and contact documented.
  - Safety filters: ensure evaluation content warnings, especially for toxicity/harassment prompts; rater safety protocol.
- Fairness and cultural considerations
  - Audit per-language performance gaps; document dialect coverage; avoid stigmatizing examples; list known harms and mitigations.

Phase 5 — Archival uploads and DOIs (Day 9–11)
- Code and models
  - GitHub release v1.0.0 with checksums (SHA256) for weights; link to tagged commit; attach Docker image digest.
  - Zenodo DOI: connect to GitHub release for archival; ensure metadata (title, authors, ORCID, abstract, keywords, funding).
  - Hugging Face models: upload checkpoints with model cards; add language tags and license; include inference examples.
- Datasets
  - Hugging Face Datasets (if allowed) with dataset card and version tag; otherwise publish data_scripts and checksum manifests; archive preprocessing scripts on Zenodo with DOI.
- Paper preprint
  - arXiv: upload camera-ready or slightly expanded version (respect venue policy); include source or PDF + ancillary files (appendix, README, LICENSE).
  - Embed links/DOIs to code, models, datasets in the arXiv record and paper footnotes.
- Optional registries
  - Papers with Code: link tasks and results; set artifact badges.
  - OpenAlex/ORCID: ensure works are linked.

Phase 6 — Conference submission portal (Day 11–12)
- Upload camera-ready PDF, source (if required), and supplementary (appendix, artifact guide).
- Fill metadata: author order, affiliations, emails, ORCIDs, acknowledgments, funding, conflicts of interest.
- Provide artifact links: code repo, model hub, dataset page, and DOIs; include video/demo if requested.
- Validate generated proceedings proof; check figure quality and Unicode rendering.

Phase 7 — Final checks and announcement (Day 13–14)
- Fresh-machine reproduction of at least one main result using public artifacts.
- Link checker across PDF, README, model/data cards; fix 404s and permissions.
- Publish release notes and a short announcement (mailing list, social, community forum); invite replication and contributions.

Required disclosure statements (templates to adapt)
- Data availability
  - We release [dataset name/version] under [license]. For corpora we do not control, we provide fetch scripts and document original licenses/TOS. All dialogue data were de-identified; PII removal and consent details are in the data card.
- Software and model availability
  - Code is available at [URL, DOI] under [license] with one-command reproduction. Models are released at [HF link, DOI] under [model license]; weight deltas are provided when upstream licenses restrict redistribution.
- Ethics and human subjects
  - The study was determined [approved/exempt/Not Human Subjects Research] by an institutional review board. Annotators provided informed consent and were compensated at or above local living wage. Safety protocols were used for exposure to toxic content.
- Multilingual considerations
  - Languages covered: [list with ISO 639-3 + scripts]. Translation [human/MT] with [quality controls]. We report per-language metrics and known gaps (dialects, code-switch). Cultural sensitivities and potential harms are discussed in the ethics section.
- Privacy and safety
  - We removed or masked PII from all text. For any remaining risky content, we provide a takedown contact: [email/form]. The models are not intended for deployment without content moderation and human oversight.
- Limitations
  - Coverage is limited to [domains/languages]; performance may degrade on unseen dialects and code-switched inputs. MT-induced biases and translation artifacts may affect results despite quality controls.
- Compute and environmental impact
  - Training/evaluation used [accelerator-hours] on [hardware]; estimated energy/CO2e computed via [tool/assumptions], reported in the model card.
- Conflicts of interest and funding
  - List funding sources and any relevant affiliations or competing interests.

Cross-lingual checklist (quick)
- Language tags and scripts correct and consistent across paper, code, and data.
- No translation leakage across splits (same source dialogue or translation pair never crosses splits).
- Unicode-safe tokenizers; right-to-left rendering validated; normalization documented.
- Per-language PII scrubbed; profanity/toxicity filters reviewed by native speakers where possible.
- Per-language metrics and CIs reported; tuning budgets balanced across languages.
- Licenses verified; redistribution boundaries respected; DOIs minted and linked in paper.

Go/no-go gates before submission
- All artifact links public and reproducible; at least one end-to-end run passes on a fresh machine.
- Legal/privacy review signed off; IRB and consent statements complete.
- Camera-ready PDF passes venue checks (fonts, length, metadata) and renders multilingual text correctly.
- Disclosure statements included and consistent across paper, README, and cards.

If you share your target venue and which languages/dialects and modalities you cover (text-only vs speech), I can tailor the disclosure wording to that author kit (e.g., ACL Responsible NLP items) and provide a minimal repo/card scaffold with language-aware examples.
