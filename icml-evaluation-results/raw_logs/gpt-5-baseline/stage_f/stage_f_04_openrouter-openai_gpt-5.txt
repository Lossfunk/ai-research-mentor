Great—here’s a compact, venue-specific map of formatting and artifact expectations (pages, anonymization, code/data release) for likely targets of “Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?”, followed by an adapted submission plan with concrete actions. Please verify final details against the current CFP/author kit.

Venue-specific expectations

ICLR (OpenReview, public discussion)
- Pages: Main text up to 10 pages (strict); references and appendix unlimited. Limitations section mandatory.
- Anonymization: Double-blind; submission and discussion on OpenReview.
- Ethics/checklists: Reproducibility checklist; ethics/impact if applicable.
- Code/data: Code link strongly encouraged by submission and typically expected by camera-ready; datasets must be properly cited and licensed.
- Artifact notes: Public discussion means you should prepare clean, anonymous artifacts at submission.

ICML
- Pages: 8 pages main; references unlimited; appendix allowed.
- Anonymization: Double-blind.
- Ethics/checklists: Reproducibility checklist; ethics statement if applicable.
- Code/data: Code release strongly encouraged by camera-ready (links can be anonymous at submission).
- Artifact notes: No public discussion; prepare anonymous repo/supplement for reviewers.

NeurIPS
- Pages: Typically 9 pages main; references unlimited; appendix allowed.
- Anonymization: Double-blind.
- Ethics/checklists: Reproducibility checklist; ethics review for flagged papers; disclosure of limitations/risks when relevant.
- Code/data: Code release strongly encouraged at camera-ready; Datasets & Benchmarks track if applicable.
- Artifact notes: Optional Artifact Evaluation; consider signing up if systems/engineering is central.

CVPR/ICCV (vision-centric MIL, e.g., WSI/patch MIL)
- Pages: 8 pages main (strict), references unlimited; supp allowed.
- Anonymization: Double-blind.
- Ethics/checklists: Reproducibility checklist required in recent years; disclosure for sensitive data.
- Code/data: Encouraged; not always required at submission; increasingly expected at camera-ready.
- Artifact notes: Focus on figure/readability; strict formatting checks.

MICCAI (medical imaging MIL)
- Pages: LNCS format; typically 8 pages (check year); references included.
- Anonymization: Double-blind.
- Ethics/checklists: Human-subjects/IRB statements where applicable; data-use agreements; clinical privacy.
- Code/data: Encouraged; not always required; de-identification and access statements important.
- Artifact notes: Reviewers expect site-level split rigor and DUAs when relevant.

TMLR (rolling review, journal-quality)
- Pages: No tight cap; concise main with appendices okay (TMLR template).
- Anonymization: Not double-blind; open reviews on OpenReview.
- Ethics/checklists: Strong reproducibility standards.
- Code/data: Code expected for acceptance unless strong justification; datasets must be accessible or well-documented.
- Artifact notes: Good option if you need more space for extensive analyses.

JMLR (journal)
- Pages: No strict limit; thorough methods + proofs + engineering details.
- Anonymization: Not double-blind.
- Ethics/checklists: High reproducibility expectations.
- Code/data: Strongly encouraged; artifacts often hosted with paper.
- Artifact notes: Best for mature, extended version.

Recommendation for MIL transfer paper
- Primary: ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS depending on space needed and schedule.
- If vision-heavy with patch/WSI focus: CVPR (or MICCAI if clinical).
- Rolling backup or extended version: TMLR (quicker than JMLR, allows longer exposition).

Adapted submission plan

Choose a primary + backup path now
- General ML path: Primary ICLR (10 pages), backup ICML (8 pages). Prepare both 10p and 8p cuts in parallel.
- Vision path: Primary CVPR (8 pages), backup ICLR/ICML (10p/8p cuts).
- Medical path: Primary MICCAI (LNCS 8p), backup TMLR.

Core cross-venue tasks (do regardless)
- Drafts: Maintain two synced manuscripts: 10-page ICLR cut and 8-page ICML/CVPR/MICCAI cut. Keep a long Appendix with full ablations.
- Repro checklist: Fill venue’s checklist and bind it to methods/configs/seeds.
- Ethics/limitations: MIL-specific risks (site leakage, label noise, privacy), IRB/DUA notes if medical, and environmental compute disclosure.
- Artifacts: Anonymous repo with scripts, configs, seed files, environment (Conda/Docker), and a data-prep stub that fetches from official sources (no mirroring restricted data). Include CITATION.cff and LICENSE.

Timeline with venue-specific gates (6 weeks; shift to your deadline)

Week 6: Scoping and templates
- Decide primary + backup venue; pull the official LaTeX template(s).
- Lock page budgets: identify what lives in main vs appendix for 10p and 8p.
- Create anonymous artifact skeleton: anon GitHub or private OSF/Zenodo with reserved DOI; avoid institutional hints.

Week 5: Experiments and provenance
- Run primary transfer setups and compute logging.
- Build provenance table: datasets, URLs, licenses, redistribution stance, DUAs. For medical: add site IDs and de-identification statement.
- Start limitations + ethics; draft reproducibility checklist.

Week 4: Secondary analyses and figures
- Complete ablations: frozen vs fine-tune, bag-size sensitivity, cross-domain pairs, negative transfer examples.
- Generate camera-ready figures optimized for grayscale and 8p/10p layouts.
- Update artifacts: one-command runners; README with exact commands.

Week 3: Stability and statistics
- Fix seeds; repeated runs for CIs; paired tests/bootstraps for key deltas.
- Finalize tables for 10p and prune for 8p version.
- Internal compliance pass: anonymization, license check, IRB/DUA text, energy/CO2 section.

Week 2: Draft freeze and artifact polish
- Freeze ICLR 10p and ICML/CVPR 8p drafts; push overflow to appendix.
- Anonymous artifact link tested on a clean machine; pin versions; export SBOM/requirements.
- Fill venue-specific forms: ICLR limitations, ICML/NeurIPS ethics flags, CVPR reproducibility checklist, MICCAI IRB text.

Week 1: Pre-submission QA
- External dry-run review; tighten claims; ensure negative transfer is reported.
- Verify formatting (margins, fonts, citations) and references compile cleanly.
- Tag artifact release for reviewers; confirm no PII in logs or examples.

Submission week
- Final anonymization check; verify page limits (10p/8p) and templates.
- Submit main + supp/appendix; include anonymous artifact link.
- Archive commit hashes, seeds, and environment lockfiles.

Venue-specific deltas to apply

ICLR
- Ensure a distinct Limitations section in the main paper.
- Prepare for public OpenReview discussion: have rebuttal templates, reproducibility details, and clarifications ready.
- Submit with anonymous code link if feasible; at minimum commit to releasing by camera-ready.

ICML
- Keep to 8-page cap; push method detail to appendix with clear pointers.
- Complete ICML reproducibility checklist thoroughly; anonymous artifact strongly preferred.

NeurIPS
- Include explicit ethics considerations if flagged (privacy, dataset licenses, environmental impact).
- Consider Artifact Evaluation; package a Docker image and hardware notes (GPU model, memory, interconnect).

CVPR/ICCV
- Aggressive figure optimization for 8 pages; move ablations to supplement.
- Fill reproducibility checklist; state dataset access and non-redistribution where required.
- Anonymous code link helpful but not strictly required at submission; plan for release by camera-ready.

MICCAI
- LNCS formatting from the start; strict page economy.
- Prominently include de-identification, IRB/ethics determination, and DUA status.
- Report site-level splits to avoid leakage; consider subgroup results by site/scanner.

TMLR
- Expand analyses and robustness checks; include comprehensive artifacts.
- Not double-blind: refactor text to include prior work context without anonymization constraints.
- Expect to release code/data or provide strong justification otherwise.

Quick decisions to make this week
- Pick primary/backup venue path and lock page budgets.
- Decide artifact modality at submission (anonymous repo vs private link) and at camera-ready (public repo and DOI).
- If medical data: confirm IRB/DUA language and site split protocol.
- Choose whether to enroll in Artifact Evaluation (NeurIPS/MLSys) if you pivot to systems-heavy content later.

If you tell me your primary/backup choice (e.g., ICLR→ICML or CVPR→ICLR), I’ll convert the above into a line-item checklist keyed to that pair, including exact section word budgets for 8p vs 10p, a figure plan, and an anonymized artifact template you can drop in.
