Artifact checklist for a robotics safety paper

Reproducibility and code
- Repository with:
  - Core code (planning/control/safety monitors/runtime checks).
  - Experiment runners for each main result; single-command scripts.
  - Configuration files (YAML/TOML) mapping to each table/figure; fixed seeds; scenario manifests.
  - Environment spec (Conda/Poetry lockfile) and optional Docker; GPU/CPU architecture notes; RT kernel version if relevant.

Simulation assets
- Simulator versions and plugins (Gazebo/Ignition, MuJoCo, Isaac Sim/Gym, Webots).
- World files, robot URDF/SDF, sensor models, controller gains, physics parameters.
- Scenario catalogs with hazard scripts (human avatars, obstacles, domain randomization seeds).
- Safety monitors in-sim (zones, force/torque limits, speed/sep monitoring) with thresholds.

Hardware and deployment
- Robot model(s), firmware versions, safety-rated components (light curtains, SSM sensors), e-stop topology.
- Controller stack (ROS/ROS 2 version, middleware QoS, real-time scheduling).
- Calibration procedures, safety interlock tests, and checklists used onsite.

Metrics and logs
- Definitions and computation for safety metrics (e.g., min separation distance, speed/sep compliance, kinetic energy at contact, stop time, near-miss counts).
- Raw logs or downsampled CSVs: timestamps, state, contact/force events, safety monitor activations, intervention counts.
- Video-to-log synchronization method; scripts to reproduce plots from logs.

Validation protocols
- Test plans aligned to standards where applicable (ISO 12100 hazard analysis; ISO 13849/IEC 61508 safety levels; ISO 10218/TS 15066 for cobots; ISO 3691-4 for AMRs).
- Checklists for pre-trial safety checks; failover demonstrations; power-loss and sensor-fault tests.

Human-subjects materials (if applicable)
- Anonymized protocols, recruitment scripts, consent forms, debriefing materials.
- Risk mitigation (PPE, distance buffers, supervisor ratios); adverse event reporting template.
- Data dictionary and codebook; de-identified aggregate datasets or synthetic stand-ins.

Documentation
- README with exact commands and expected hardware; bill of materials (sensors, safety devices).
- Model and system cards: intended use, hazards, mitigations, residual risks, do-not-use cases.
- License, acceptable-use policy, and a “do not replicate without equivalent safeguards” disclaimer.
- Takedown/contact policy; calibration of sim-to-real gap and known limitations.

Ethical review steps and statements

Before experiments
- Hazard and risk assessment
  - Conduct a formal hazard analysis (ISO 12100) and document identified hazards, severity, exposure, and risk reduction measures.
  - Map safeguards to standards (e-stop, speed/sep monitoring per ISO/TS 15066; PL/cat per ISO 13849 where relevant).
- Institutional approvals
  - Human participants: IRB/ethics approval or exemption; include consent, compensation, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and vulnerable population safeguards.
  - Facility safety: lab safety committee approval for robotic experiments; method of emergency response; supervision plan.
- Data protection
  - Plan for privacy of video/biometric data; signage and consent for recordings; retention and access controls.

During experiments
- Safety protocols
  - Daily pre-run checklist, e-stop verification, interlock tests, soft limits; log all interventions.
  - PPE compliance; restricted zones; spotters; power/isolation procedures.
- Incident handling
  - Define adverse event thresholds and stop rules; incident report template.

After experiments
- Ethics statement for paper
  - Summarize approvals without revealing identity if double-blind (e.g., “approved by an institutional review board; details at camera-ready”).
  - Describe risk mitigations, intervention rates, residual risks, and takedown policy for any released data/videos.
  - Note dual-use and misuse concerns; describe gating or limitations in artifact release.

Anonymization guidance (for double-blind venues: RSS, CoRL, HRI)
- Remove logos/banners from videos; blur faces/badges; neutralize distinctive environments.
- Strip file metadata; anonymize repo (no org names in URLs, commit history squashed).
- Refer to prior work in third person; avoid naming local institutions, test sites, or proprietary equipment uniquely linked to authors.

Six-week timeline with venue-specific checkpoints

Week 6: Scope lock and templates
- Select primary and backup venue; pull LaTeX and video specs.
- Freeze core claims, metrics, and standards mapping (which ISO/IEC standards you reference).
- Draft ethics and safety protocol; begin IRB/lab approvals if needed.
- Gate: Confirm you can anonymize videos if required by chosen venue.

Week 5: Experiments and video storyboard
- Run primary safety evaluations in sim and limited real-world trials with full safeguards.
- Storyboard the 3-minute video; capture raw footage with overlays and synchronized logs.
- Build artifact skeleton: repo layout, env files, sim worlds, config manifests.

Week 4: Results, audits, and first cuts
- Complete critical trials; compute safety metrics; generate plots.
- Assemble first video cut; add captions; check size/codec; apply anonymization if needed.
- Populate documentation: hazard analysis summary, test checklists, README commands.

Week 3: Reproducibility and ethics pass
- Fresh-machine run of simulation experiments via one-command scripts.
- Internal ethics/safety audit: IRB text, incident logs, intervention counts, dual-use risks.
- Finalize human-subjects materials (anonymized) for appendix if applicable.

Week 2: Paper freeze v1 and artifact hardening
- Freeze main paper within page limits; move extended methods/results to appendix/supplement.
- Lock video v2; confirm format spec (length, codec, resolution, size, anonymization).
- Tag artifact release (anonymous for double-blind); verify determinism and seed control.

Week 1: Compliance polish
- Final ethics statement; standards mapping; add “do-not-replicate unsafely” disclaimers.
- Verify all links, metadata scrubbing, and video accessibility (subtitles, readability).
- Backup plan for alternative video encodes (bitrate ladder) in case of portal rejection.

Submission week
- Submit paper, video, and supplements; fill reproducibility/ethics forms.
- Archive commit hashes, container digests, and video source files.
- Prepare rebuttal materials: answers on safety protocols, incident rates, standards adherence, and artifact completeness.

Quick venue deltas to remember
- Single-blind (ICRA/IROS): No need to anonymize video; prioritize clarity and completeness.
- Double-blind (RSS/CoRL/HRI): Strict anonymization in paper, video, and artifacts; don’t reveal institution or equipment uniquely tied to you.
- HRI: Stronger emphasis on human-subjects ethics, consent, accessibility, and qualitative protocols.

If you share your chosen primary/backup venue and whether you have human-participant studies, I can tailor the exact page/video specs, produce a venue-compliant ethics statement, and draft a reviewer-facing artifact README (anonymous or named) you can drop into your repo.
