Below is a conference-ready slide outline for a trustworthy LLM evaluation paper. It’s organized for a 12–15 minute talk with 14 core slides plus recommended backup. Contributions, limitations, and future work are explicitly highlighted.

Slide 1 — Title and context (0:30)
- Paper title, authors, venue/year
- One-liner: what “trustworthy LLM evaluation” means (safety, reliability, fairness, privacy, and accountability)
- Tagline: what gap your work fills (e.g., standardized, multi-criteria, reproducible eval for LLMs)

Slide 2 — Motivation: why trust evaluation now (0:45)
- Real-world failures: hallucinations, unsafe advice, bias, privacy leakage
- Fragmented metrics and inconsistent protocols
- Need for comparable, stress-tested, and cost-conscious evaluation

Slide 3 — Problem framing and taxonomy (1:00)
- Axes of trust you evaluate: factuality/faithfulness, safety/toxicity/refusals, robustness (paraphrase, prompt injection), privacy/memorization, fairness, calibration/uncertainty, transparency
- Scenarios: in-the-wild prompts vs task benchmarks; tool-augmented vs base LLM
- Threat models: jailbreakers, data contamination, privacy adversaries

Slide 4 — Contributions (headline slide) (0:45)
- Unified benchmark and protocol across N trust axes with standardized prompts, seeds, and CIs
- New or harmonized metrics (e.g., exposure-based leakage + membership inference; refusal quality vs over-refusal trade-off)
- Red-teaming harness and auto-adversarial paraphrasing to probe robustness
- Human–model hybrid evaluation with rater guidance and calibration checks
- Open artifacts: code, configs, seeds, containers; reproducible one-command runs

Slide 5 — Evaluation design and datasets (1:00)
- Task suites and sources (brief list; licenses respected; no redistribution of restricted data)
- Data splits: contamination-aware temporal splits; template paraphrases to reduce prompt leakage
- Human annotation protocols: rater training, rubrics, IAA; safety escalation rules

Slide 6 — Models and settings (0:45)
- Models evaluated (categories: open, closed, fine-tuned, tool-augmented)
- Inference settings: decoding params, system prompts, safety policies
- Cost/latency measurement method; carbon/energy logging (if included)

Slide 7 — Metrics at a glance (1:00)
- Factuality/faithfulness: citation grounding, answer consistency
- Safety: toxicity, refusal appropriateness, jailbreak success rate
- Privacy: canary exposure, membership inference advantage
- Robustness: paraphrase invariance, prompt-injection resilience
- Fairness: subgroup gaps; error asymmetries
- Calibration: ECE/Brier with self-reported confidence

Slide 8 — Key results overview (1:15)
- Trust scorecard heatmap: models × axes (topline takeaways)
- Pareto front: quality vs safety vs cost
- Notable trade-offs: safety policies vs over-refusal; robustness vs latency

Slide 9 — Case studies and failure modes (1:00)
- Hallucinated-but-confident answers and citation failures
- Successful jailbreak pattern(s) and mitigations that worked
- Privacy leakage example (controlled canary) and exposure thresholds

Slide 10 — Robustness and ablations (0:45)
- Sensitivity to paraphrase, context length, and tool use
- Prompt-injection defenses: instruction hygiene, model/tool sandboxing
- Safety policy tuning: impact on helpfulness vs refusals

Slide 11 — Human evaluation and calibration (0:45)
- Rater rubric summary and IAA
- Confidence vs correctness calibration plot; selective prediction or abstention

Slide 12 — Limitations (headline slide) (1:00)
- Scope: languages/domains covered; closed-model black-box measurement constraints
- Residual contamination risks; metrics that are proxies (not ground truth safety or legal compliance)
- Human eval subjectivity and rater pool composition
- Temporal drift: results tied to specific model versions and policy snapshots

Slide 13 — Future work (headline slide) (1:00)
- Task provenance and stronger contamination auditing; longitudinal tracking across model updates
- Richer privacy audits (attribute inference, inversion) and benchmark hardening
- Multi-agent and tool-integrated safety evaluation; sandboxed tool policies
- Contextual fairness (jurisdiction/locale) and down-stream human impact studies
- Uncertainty-aware interfaces and calibrated refusals

Slide 14 — Artifacts and takeaways (0:45)
- What’s released: code, configs, seeds, containers; eval harness; rater rubric; sample prompts
- How to reproduce: one-command scripts; expected CIs; environment pins
- Call to action: adopt protocol, contribute adversarial prompts, report model/version diffs

Optional slide 15 — Acknowledgments and contact (0:30)
- Funding and collaborators (or defer if double-blind requirements apply)
- Links: repo/DOI, benchmark leaderboard, contact

Design notes and visuals
- Use a consistent “trust axes” color palette across slides
- Include one summary heatmap and one Pareto plot early
- Use callouts for Contributions, Limitations, Future Work to satisfy program chairs’ guidance

Backup slides (for Q&A)
- Detailed dataset/license table; contamination checks and date cutoffs
- Prompt templates; jailbreak and paraphrase generators; defense configurations
- Metric definitions and formulas; bootstrap/perm tests; CI computation
- Human eval: rubric, rater training, IAA details
- Privacy: canary implantation, exposure calc, membership inference setup
- Cost/energy methodology and assumptions; hardware specifics; determinism flags
- Per-model policy settings; decoding parameters; refusal criteria
- Failure case gallery with red-team prompts and outputs

Speaker reminders
- Don’t imply deployment safety; emphasize evaluation scope and proxies
- Attribute limitations to measurement and model versioning; avoid overclaiming
- If double-blind, remove logos/names; genericize acknowledgments; scrub slide metadata

Customization checklist before export
- Replace N, dataset names, and model categories with your specifics
- Insert final numbers into heatmap and Pareto plots
- Confirm all links (repo/DOI) and anonymization status per venue
- Add a one-line disclaimer on non-deployment and rater safety protocol if sensitive prompts are shown
