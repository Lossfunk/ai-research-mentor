Below is a concise, venue-agnostic submission checklist tailored to “Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?” plus a final timeline, risks with mitigations, and the most likely missing items to close before submission. Adjust page limits/sections to your target venue (NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/TMLR/ACL).

Submission checklist

Framing and contributions
- [ ] Clear problem statement: what “transfer” means for MIL (cross-dataset, cross-domain, cross-label-distribution, cross-bag-size, frozen encoder transfer vs fine-tune, negative transfer).
- [ ] Contributions list scoped and verifiable (e.g., unified evaluation protocol, new transfer taxonomy for MIL, strong baselines, failure analysis, theory/intuition for when transfer helps/hurts).
- [ ] Threats to validity section addressing confounders (encoder pretraining vs MIL aggregator capacity, bag construction differences, label noise).

Method and baselines
- [ ] MIL methods specified: instance encoders, bag pooling/aggregators (max/mean, attention-based pooling, Deep Sets, Transformer/Set Transformer, distribution pooling).
- [ ] Transfer protocols spelled out: source/target datasets, what is frozen vs tuned, number of labeled bags in target, hyperparameter reuse vs retuning, early stopping criteria.
- [ ] Strong baselines: non-MIL pooled-instance baseline, simple linear probe on pooled embeddings, SOTA MIL models for your domains.
- [ ] Ablations: pooling choice, instance encoder variants, bag size handling (subsampling, curriculum), distribution-shift robustness, calibration.
- [ ] Negative transfer analysis: metrics and cases where transfer reduces performance; diagnostic tests to detect and mitigate.

Data, licenses, and provenance
- [ ] Dataset roster with URLs, citations, and licenses for each source and target dataset.
- [ ] Redistribution stance: confirm whether you mirror data or require users to fetch from original source.
- [ ] Bag construction procedure documented (instance sampling, patch extraction, augmentations), and bag-size distributions reported.
- [ ] If using medical or other sensitive data: confirm de-identification and public-data status; if any restricted data used, document DUAs/permissions.

Human subjects and privacy
- [ ] State whether you collected any new human data or annotations. If yes: IRB/ethics determination (approved/exempt), consent, pay rates, demographics handling.
- [ ] Privacy safeguards for any sensitive domains (e.g., WSIs): confirm no PII; takedown procedure.

Compute and environment
- [ ] Hardware details: GPUs/TPUs, counts, memory, interconnect, CPU/RAM.
- [ ] Software: frameworks, versions, CUDA/cuDNN, mixed precision, kernels.
- [ ] Reproducibility: seeds, batch sizes, LR schedules, epochs/steps, early-stopping rules.
- [ ] Compute accounting: per-experiment accelerator-hours and total; energy/CO2 estimates with region/emission factor and tool used (e.g., CodeCarbon).

Evaluation protocol
- [ ] Metrics for bag-level and instance-level (if inferred): ROC-AUC/PR-AUC, accuracy, calibration (ECE), uncertainty where relevant.
- [ ] Transfer setups: few-shot vs full-shot target, frozen vs fine-tuned encoder, cross-domain pairs; report confidence intervals via repeated runs.
- [ ] Fairness/safety where applicable: subgroup performance (e.g., site/hospital, scanner), dataset shift robustness; clearly note not applicable if domain lacks sensitive attributes.
- [ ] Statistical testing: paired tests or bootstrap CIs for key comparisons; pre-register primary endpoints if possible.

Reporting and analysis
- [ ] Clear learning curves vs number of target bags; sample efficiency.
- [ ] Scaling with bag size and instance count; time/latency vs accuracy trade-offs.
- [ ] Failure analysis with representative qualitative examples; when and why transfer fails.
- [ ] Limitations section: scope boundaries, threats to external validity, compute and data constraints.

Artifacts and reproducibility
- [ ] Code with README, env file, scripts to reproduce all tables/figures; one-command runner for each main experiment.
- [ ] Data preparation scripts or exact instructions; tokenizer/patch extractor versions and parameters.
- [ ] Model checkpoints or weight deltas (if base models cannot be redistributed).
- [ ] License file for your code; third-party dependency licenses inventoried.

Ethics/compliance statements
- [ ] Ethics statement covering data provenance/licensing, privacy, potential harms, environmental impact.
- [ ] Limitations/negative societal impact as required by venue.
- [ ] Availability statements: what is released (code, configs, weights, deltas), and access modality (open/gated).

Writing and formatting
- [ ] Anonymization: remove identifying metadata and self-referential links; use “Anonymous” for artifacts if required.
- [ ] Page limits respected; references unlimited; appendices clearly labeled.
- [ ] Figures readable in grayscale; captions self-contained; ablation and protocol details linked from main text to appendix.
- [ ] Venue’s reproducibility checklist completed.

Final timeline to submission (6-week plan; compress or stretch as needed)

Week 6 (T–6 to T–5 weeks)
- Lock scope and protocol: finalize transfer taxonomy, datasets, and source→target pairs.
- Implement missing baselines; freeze hyperparameter search space and evaluation metrics.
- Start compute/energy logging and artifact repo skeleton.

Week 5
- Run full sweeps for primary setups (frozen vs fine-tuned encoder; few-shot vs full-shot).
- Build data provenance and license appendix; confirm any restricted datasets and DUAs.
- Draft Methods and Experimental Setup; prepare initial figures.

High-probability risks and mitigations

Conceptual
- Ambiguous definition of “transfer” in MIL leads to weak or unfalsifiable claims.
  - Mitigation: Predefine transfer taxonomy, primary endpoints, and success criteria; report negative transfer cases.
- Confounding from encoder pretraining vs MIL aggregator.
  - Mitigation: Include controls with frozen encoders, linear probes, and pooled-instance baselines.

Data/protocol
- Dataset license or redistribution conflicts.
  - Mitigation: Use a provenance appendix; don’t mirror restricted data; replace or gate problematic sources.
- Hidden data leakage via patient/site overlap between source and target.
  - Mitigation: Enforce site-level splits; report site IDs; test cross-site transfer explicitly.

Methods/engineering
- Training instability for large bags; results sensitive to bag-size sampling.
  - Mitigation: Deterministic sampling seeds; curriculum or capped instances per bag; report sensitivity curves.
- Unfair hyperparameter tuning across methods or domains.
  - Mitigation: Shared search space and budget; tune on source only or via nested CV; disclose budgets.

Results/claims
- Negative results underreported; reviewers question generality.
  - Mitigation: Include negative transfer analysis, error taxonomy, and guidance on when not to transfer.

Reproducibility and artifacts
- Missing scripts or pinned versions block reproduction.
  - Mitigation: Freeze env, export SBOM/requirements, include run scripts and data prep instructions; test on fresh machine.

Ethics/privacy
- Use of sensitive medical images without clear de-identification or ethics note.
  - Mitigation: State public-data status and de-identification; if any human data collected, include IRB/exempt determination; add takedown policy.

Compute/environment
- No compute/CO2 reporting or hardware details.
  - Mitigation: Log accelerator-hours; estimate energy/CO2 with region; include efficiency notes.

Formatting/compliance
- Violating anonymization or page limits; missing checklist items.
  - Mitigation: Early compliance pass; finalize at T–3 days; use venue template from the start.
