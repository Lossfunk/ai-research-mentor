Happy to do a targeted ethics/compliance pass. Here’s a concise, LLM-compression–focused audit checklist plus concrete fixes you can apply now.

What I need from you for a precise review
- List of all datasets and models used (pretraining, finetuning, evaluation), with URLs and stated licenses.
- Whether any human subjects/annotations were collected (and how).
- Your release plan (code, weights, data; gated or open).
- Compute details (hardware, hours, regions, frameworks, seeds).
- Draft ethics/limitations sections and any license/attribution appendix.

Rapid self-audit checklist and fixes

A) Dataset licensing and provenance
- Risk: License mismatch or unclear rights (e.g., CC BY-SA sources, GPL code, site TOS violations, derivative redistribution limits).
  - Fixes:
    - Create a per-asset provenance table listing: name, source URL, original license, permitted uses (research/commercial), redistribution allowed (Y/N), modification allowed (Y/N), special terms/DUA.
    - Replace or segregate assets with share-alike or no-derivatives licenses if your release can’t comply; provide attribution where required.
    - If web-scraped, document robots.txt/TOS compliance and why usage is lawful; state takedown procedure.
    - For composite corpora (C4, The Pile, GitHub code): acknowledge mixed licensing and exclude copyleft or incompatible subsets if you intend to redistribute.
- Risk: Using model outputs or datasets whose TOS forbids training/distillation.
  - Fixes:
    - Confirm provider terms explicitly permit training on outputs; if not, remove or get permission. Document in the appendix.
- Risk: Evaluation benchmarks with restricted redistribution.
  - Fixes:
    - Cite and link to official download; don’t mirror restricted data. State that users must accept original licenses.

B) Human data, privacy, and sensitive content
- Risk: PII/sensitive data in training/eval sets; KV-cache logs accidentally containing user text during eval.
  - Fixes:
    - Describe PII filtering, de-identification, and residual risk. Commit to takedown on request.
    - Ensure eval logs exclude or redact user content; avoid releasing raw prompts unless consented.
- Risk: Human annotation without ethics approval or fair compensation.
  - Fixes:
    - State IRB/ethics board status (approved/exempt/Not Human Subjects Research) and rationale. Include consent procedure, pay rates, demographics handling, and harm mitigation.
- If claiming privacy guarantees (e.g., differential privacy), include formal parameters and empirical privacy tests (membership inference, canary exposure).

C) Third-party model licenses and derivative weights
- Risk: Redistributing compressed/quantized derivatives in violation of base model license.
  - Fixes:
    - For each base model (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Falcon), list the exact license and whether redistribution of modified weights is allowed; comply with any acceptable-use policies or gating requirements. If unclear, release recipes/checkpoints that require users to apply deltas to obtain weights from the original.
    - If base weights are non-redistributable, release code, configs, and patch/delta files only, with instructions to reproduce locally from the original source.
- Risk: Distilling from proprietary APIs with restricted use.
  - Fixes:
    - Verify API terms allow training/distillation on outputs; if disallowed, remove distilled data or secure permission and disclose.

D) Compute, energy, and environment
- Risk: Undisclosed or non-reproducible compute; no environmental accounting.
  - Fixes:
    - Report hardware types/counts, accelerator memory, interconnect, software versions, precision, batch sizes, training/eval hours, seeds.
    - Provide compute accounting: total accelerator-hours per experiment, and energy/CO2 estimates (e.g., via CodeCarbon or regional intensity factors). Include region and emission factors.
    - State efficiency measures (mixed precision, sparsity, quantization-aware training) and their impact.

E) Safety, dual-use, and misuse
- Risk: Compressed models reduce safety alignment, ease misuse, or amplify bias.
  - Fixes:
    - Evaluate safety/bias before/after compression (toxicity, stereotyping, jailbreak robustness) and report regressions.
    - Choose a release strategy: full weights, gated access, or evaluation-only. Justify with risk assessment; include a model card and usage policy.
    - If releasing, apply a license/policy reflecting acceptable use; document refusal behaviors and known failure modes.

F) Fairness and representation
- Risk: Performance drops disproportionately across groups or languages after compression.
  - Fixes:
    - Include group-wise metrics where applicable; note trade-offs and mitigations (e.g., group-aware calibration, targeted finetuning).

G) Reproducibility and artifacts
- Risk: Missing details required by venue reproducibility checklists.
  - Fixes:
    - Provide full hyperparameters, seeds, data splits, exact preprocessing/tokenizers, commit hashes, and scripts.
    - Release inference kernels for quantized ops, calibration data, and accuracy-vs-latency measurements on stated hardware.
    - If possible, enter artifact evaluation (e.g., MLSys/NeurIPS AE) and provide a Docker/Conda environment.

H) Security and IP hygiene
- Risk: License contamination (e.g., GPL code) or insecure dependencies.
  - Fixes:
    - Include a dependency and license inventory; replace incompatible licenses; generate an SBOM if feasible.
    - Document model robustness to bit-flips/faults if you claim safety in low-bit regimes; disclose known vulnerabilities.

I) Accessibility and transparency
- Fixes:
    - Provide model and data cards; clear README; changelog; citation and attribution statements.
    - Add a limitations section that candidly states failure modes, populations not tested, and non-goals.

Venue-specific must-haves (adapt as needed)
- NeurIPS/ICML: Reproducibility checklist; ethics statement if applicable; negative societal impact discussion when relevant; code/data plan.
- ICLR: Mandatory Limitations section; reproducibility checklist; code link expected by camera-ready.
- MLSys: Strong systems methodology; hardware specs; latency/throughput/energy; artifact badge encouraged.
- ACL/EMNLP: Ethics statement; data and software availability statements; dataset/annotation documentation.

Templates you can drop in (edit to fit)
- Ethics statement scaffold:
  - Data provenance and licensing: “We list all datasets, sources, and licenses in Appendix X and confirm our use complies with redistribution and derivative-work terms. We exclude sources with incompatible terms.”
  - Human data and privacy: “No new human data were collected” or “We obtained informed consent, with IRB protocol #, fair compensation, and privacy safeguards; PII was removed and residual risk is discussed.”
  - Safety/misuse: “Compression can reduce safety margins. We evaluate toxicity/jailbreak robustness pre/post compression and release under [license/policy], with gating for high-risk weights.”
  - Environmental impact: “Training consumed N GPU-hours (~E kWh, ~C kgCO2e based on region R); we used mixed precision/low-bit inference to reduce energy.”
- License appendix scaffold (one line per asset):
  - Asset name; URL; License; Permitted uses; Redistribution allowed; Modifications allowed; Special terms/DUA; Notes on compliance.

Common gotchas in compressible LLM papers
- Redistributing quantized derivatives of closed or community-licensed models without checking redistribution clauses.
- Using StackOverflow/CC BY-SA content without triggering share-alike obligations.
- GitHub code pretraining without filtering copyleft licenses.
- KV-cache or activation logs containing user or proprietary text in released artifacts.
- Missing latency/energy metrics to justify “efficient.”

Action plan you can implement this week
1) Build the provenance/license appendix and replace or gate any problematic assets.
2) Decide the release mode (weights vs. deltas vs. code-only) consistent with upstream licenses and risk.
3) Add compute/energy disclosure and satisfy the target venue’s checklist.
4) Run and report safety/bias regressions post-compression; adjust release accordingly.
5) Write the ethics/limitations sections using the scaffold above.
6) Prepare artifact packaging (env, scripts, seeds) and optional artifact evaluation.

If you paste your sections (or share a link), I’ll mark specific red flags, propose compliant wording, and suggest minimal changes to make the paper camera-ready for your target venues.
