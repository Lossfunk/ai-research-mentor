Below are ready-to-use artifact release notes plus rebuttal-style reviewer response bullet points for an interpretable medical imaging paper. They are written to comply with double-blind anonymization and patient data policies. Replace bracketed placeholders before submission.

Artifact release notes (anonymized submission package)

Title and version
- Project: Interpretable Medical Imaging (Anonymized Artifact)
- Version: v0.9 (for review); camera-ready will be v1.0 with non-anonymous metadata

What’s included
- Code: training, evaluation, and interpretation modules (e.g., attribution maps, concept-based explanations)
- Configs: per-experiment YAMLs mapping each paper table/figure to seeds and hyperparameters
- Evaluation: scripts for metrics (AUROC/AP, calibration, explanation faithfulness: deletion/insertion, ROAR), and robustness tests
- Sample data: small, de-identified or synthetic examples sufficient to validate pipelines
- Data fetch/prep scripts: download and preprocess from official sources (e.g., [OG dataset names]) with checksums; no redistribution of raw patient data
- Models: pretrained checkpoints for experiments on fully public, de-identified datasets whose licenses permit redistribution; otherwise weight deltas and exact training recipes
- Environment: conda env file, lockfile, and Docker image; determinism flags noted
- Documentation: README quickstart, model card(s), data card(s), PRIVACY.md, and ACCEPTABLE_USE.md

Privacy, de-identification, and compliance
- Data sources and status: We use public, de-identified datasets [list examples and licenses], and no raw PHI is redistributed
- DICOM handling: For any DICOM inputs used locally, scripts apply standard de-identification (e.g., DICOM PS3.15 Annex E profile) and:
  - Remove/rewrite PHI-bearing tags (PatientName, PatientID, AccessionNumber, StudyDate, InstitutionName, etc.)
  - Optional date shifting and UID remapping
  - Burned-in annotation detection and masking (OCR-based), with manual spot checks
- Faces/3D data: Head MR/CT defacing performed using [tool]; verification screenshots provided for samples
- Logs and artifacts: No file paths, site IDs, or textual snippets from patient records in logs or outputs; images in the repo are either synthetic or from public de-identified sets
- Takedown: PRIVACY.md describes a takedown process for any inadvertent identifiers
- Regulatory note: Research-only; not intended for clinical use; conforms to dataset DUAs/TOS; HIPAA/GDPR considerations documented in PRIVACY.md

Anonymization measures (double-blind)
- Repository owner/name and commit history are anonymized; no lab/institution identifiers in code, docs, or metadata
- Figures and screenshots have no logos, site names, or identifiable environments; file EXIF and PDF metadata cleared
- IRB/ethics language is generic for review; specifics will be added at camera-ready

Reproducibility and how to run
- One-command reproducibility:
  - make reproduce-Table1 (node classification AUROC + CIs)
  - make reproduce-Fig3 (faithfulness curves: deletion/insertion)
- Seeds: fixed per run; configs specify seeds, folds, and site-level splits to prevent leakage
- Hardware: tested on [GPU/CPU]; expected runtimes documented
- Results manifest: results_manifest.json maps each artifact result to config, seed, expected metric (mean ± CI)
- Fresh-machine test: scripts/ci_smoke_test.sh validates end-to-end on a small public subset

Licensing and redistribution
- Code: [MIT/Apache-2.0] license; see LICENSE
- Weights: [Apache-2.0/RAIL/custom acceptable-use], aligned with upstream model licenses; deltas provided where redistribution is restricted
- Data: Not redistributed; data_scripts point to official sources and cite licenses; see DATA_LICENSES.md
- Third-party: Dependency license report included in LICENSES/ with notices

Known constraints and limitations
- Restricted datasets: For [dataset], only fetch scripts and evaluation configs provided; reproduction requires user acceptance of original terms
- Clinical claims: No clinical performance claims; explanations evaluated with quantitative faithfulness metrics and expert review where applicable; deployment risks noted in model card

Contact and disclosure
- For review: communication via issue tracker under anonymized handle; direct contact and affiliations to be provided post-acceptance
- Post-acceptance: public DOI (Zenodo) will archive code tag, weights, and model/data cards

Checksums
- SHA256 for all released checkpoints and large artifacts listed in CHECKSUMS.txt

Rebuttal-style reviewer response bullet points

Privacy, de-identification, and patient data
- We do not redistribute raw patient data. All experiments relying on sensitive datasets are reproducible via fetch scripts that download from official sources under their original licenses/DUAs.
- De-identification: Our preprocessing removes PHI-bearing DICOM tags, masks burned-in text via OCR and heuristics, and defaces head scans when present. We provide scripts and verification guidance; example de-identified images are included solely from public datasets.
- Residual risk: We discuss re-identification risks (e.g., rare pathologies) and mitigation (cell suppression/aggregation) in the ethics section and data cards; we include a takedown policy in PRIVACY.md.
- IRB/ethics: The study uses public de-identified datasets and qualifies as Not Human Subjects Research in our jurisdiction; where expert annotations were collected, IRB approval and consent were obtained. Institutional details are withheld for double-blind review and will be provided at camera-ready.

Anonymization and double-blind compliance
- All artifacts are anonymized: repo owner, metadata, and commit history scrubbed; figures and videos contain no logos, site names, or staff identifiers. We cite our prior work in third person and avoid institution-revealing phrasing; full citations restored at camera-ready.

Data provenance and licensing
- We provide a per-dataset license table in DATA_LICENSES.md (name, URL, license, redistribution terms) and confirm TOS/robots compliance where relevant. Proprietary datasets (e.g., institutional PACS) are not redistributed nor needed to reproduce reported results.

Evaluation rigor for interpretability
- Faithfulness: We evaluate explanations via deletion/insertion curves, ROAR, and counterfactual perturbations, demonstrating correlation with model reliance.
- Robustness: Explanations are stress-tested against pre-processing changes and noise; sensitivity analyses are in the appendix.
- Expert assessment: Where applicable, blinded clinician ratings compare explanation utility; inter-rater reliability is reported.
- Failure modes: We include qualitative and quantitative cases where explanations mislead and advise against use for clinical decision-making without expert oversight.

Distribution shift and leakage prevention
- Splits: Site/hospital-level splits are enforced where metadata allow; patient-level grouping prevents identity leakage across train/val/test.
- External validation: Results on an external cohort are included; performance deltas and calibration drift are reported with CIs.

Reproducibility and artifacts
- One-command scripts reproduce each main table/figure; a results manifest specifies expected metrics with confidence intervals and seeds. Docker/conda environments are provided; a smoke test validates the pipeline on a small public subset.
- Checkpoints: Where licenses permit, we release weights; otherwise we release weight deltas and exact training configs. All large files include checksums.

Compliance and acceptable use
- The artifact is released under a permissive code license and a model acceptable-use policy: research/education only, not for clinical deployment, and subject to original dataset terms.
- Environmental disclosure: We report accelerator-hours and estimated CO2e for training and key evaluations to support sustainable research.

Clarifications offered during rebuttal
- Provide anonymized screenshots/logs demonstrating PHI tag stripping and burned-in text masking.
- Share the exact list of DICOM tags altered and the defacing tool/version used.
- Upload the seeded split manifest ensuring site- and patient-level separation.
- Supply additional clinician rating summaries (aggregated, de-identified) and inter-rater reliability statistics.

Post-acceptance commitments
- Replace anonymized artifacts with named repositories and DOIs; add full IRB details and funding acknowledgments.
- Expand model and data cards with extended clinical risk discussions and any newly approved de-identified examples.

If you share your exact datasets and venue (e.g., MICCAI, NeurIPS D&B), I can tailor the license table, DICOM tag list, and the reviewer bullets to match that venue’s ethics checklist and anonymization rules.
