Below are targeted ablations and error analyses that reviewers will likely expect for the acceptance classification task, with emphasis on hand-engineered features. Each item states what to remove/compare, what it probes, and what to report.

Feature-group ablations (to quantify spurious vs substantive signal)
- Group-wise drop tests
  - Remove one group at a time: length/page/word counts, reference counts, readability indices, section/header features, math/figure/table counts, lexical n-grams (title/abstract vs full), citation-derived signals, and any style/template cues.
  - Report ΔAUC/ΔF1 with 95% CIs; rank groups by marginal contribution.
- Additive value over text encoders
  - Compare: (i) hand-engineered only, (ii) text-only (bag-of-words or transformer on title+abstract/full), (iii) combined.
  - Report whether hand features add complementary signal and if gains persist under cross-year/venue tests.
- Abstract-only vs full-text features
  - Train/evaluate using only title+abstract features vs full-text features.
  - Shows reliance on easy abstract cues vs deeper content/structure.

Leakage and temporal controls (to rule out post-acceptance hints)
- Version freeze
  - Use arXiv v1 posted before notification; re-run after stripping later versions.
  - Report performance delta; large drops indicate leakage.
- Strip venue-status strings and template artifacts
  - Remove lines like “to appear in X,” proceedings boilerplate, and template footers.
  - Show ΔAUC/ΔF1; confirm negligible reliance on such cues.
- Citation-time censoring
  - Remove citation-based features or censor citations to pre-notification windows.
  - Report impact; strong dependence suggests leakage.

Spurious proxy and confounding checks
- Negative-control models
  - Train using only trivial proxies (page length, #references, #authors, figure/table/equation counts).
  - Your full model should clearly beat this; report the margin.
- Venue/year fixed effects and page-limit normalization
  - Z-score length-like features within venue-year; or include fixed effects and re-evaluate.
  - Demonstrates that gains aren’t due to venue-specific page limits or formatting.
- Topic-controlled evaluation
  - Match accepted/rejected papers on topic distributions (topic bins or nearest-neighbor on embeddings) and re-evaluate.
  - Attenuation in performance quantifies topic confounding.

Parsing-quality sensitivity (to avoid measurement artifacts)
- Parse quality stratification
  - Compute parse coverage (percent text recovered, section detection). Compare performance on high- vs low-quality parses.
  - Re-run after excluding low-quality parses; report stability.

Deduplication and dependence
- Near-duplicate audit
  - Use MinHash/embedding similarity to cluster near-duplicates across versions/venues/years; keep one per cluster.
  - Re-run models; report any performance drop to rule out memorization.

Counterfactual stress tests (feature dependence under controlled edits)
- Length/refs counterfactuals
  - Create counterfactual inputs by truncating body text or normalizing reference lists while keeping content constant; measure score shifts.
- Section/header perturbations
  - Shuffle or mask section headers; ablate introduction-only vs body-only to locate where signal resides.
- Content shuffling baseline
  - Shuffle sentences within sections (preserve length); if performance stays high, model relies on non-semantic cues.

Feature attribution and stability
- Global importance and stability
  - Report permutation importance or SHAP for hand features; show stability across folds/years/venues.
- Partial dependence and monotonicity
  - Plot acceptance probability vs feature (e.g., length, #refs) with CIs; check for implausible or non-monotonic effects.
- Correlation with confounders
  - Show correlations among hand features and with topic/venue to flag proxies.

Error slicing and calibration
- High-confidence error audit
  - Manually inspect a stratified sample of top-confidence false positives/negatives; categorize error modes (topic shift, novelty cues missing, formatting proxies).
- Performance by slices
  - Report metrics by year, venue, topic, document length quintiles, and parse quality; include confidence intervals.
- Calibration curves
  - Reliability diagrams and ECE; recalibrate if needed (Platt/temperature scaling) and report before/after.

Cross-domain generalization
- Train-test across time/venue
  - Train on venue-year A, test on B; compare text-only vs hand-feature-only vs combined.
  - Robust features should degrade less out of domain.

Sanity checks
- Label randomization
  - Train on randomly permuted labels; verify near-chance performance.
- Feature randomization
  - Randomize values within each feature distribution while preserving marginals; confirm collapse to chance.

What to report succinctly
- A bar chart of ΔAUC (with CIs) for each drop-one feature group.
- Negative-control baseline performance and the margin to the full model.
- Cross-year/venue generalization table showing which feature sets transfer.
- Calibration plots and ECE before/after calibration.
- An error taxonomy from high-confidence mistakes with example counts.
- A brief leakage audit (v1-only, string stripping, citation censoring) with effect sizes.

These ablations and analyses directly address the most common reviewer concerns: reliance on superficial or leaking features, lack of robustness across domains, confounding by venue/topic/format, and opaque contributions of hand-engineered features. Implementing them will make the acceptance classification results more credible and interpretable.
