Most pointed likely critique
“The error analysis is anecdotal and unconvincing: it doesn’t quantify failure modes, conflates model errors with label noise and parsing issues, relies on unfaithful saliency maps, and provides no actionable insight about when/why the models fail or how results transfer across venues/years/topics.”

Proactive mitigation strategy for the rebuttal
- Structured, quantified error taxonomy
  - Manually audit a stratified sample (e.g., N=200–300 errors across venues/years/topics; 50/50 high-confidence FPs/FNs) with 2–3 independent annotators.
  - Label causes: label noise/adjudication reversal, parsing/formatting failure, temporal/leakage artifact, topic/venue shift, reliance on proxies (length/refs), missing external context (novelty/impact), ambiguous borderline.
  - Aggregate with Dawid–Skene; report per-category rates with 95% CIs and examples (anonymized).

- Separate label vs model error
  - Adjudicate disputed labels; recompute metrics after (i) removing adjudicated-noise items and (ii) correcting them; report sensitivity bounds to show how much performance is constrained by noise.

- Slice-aware performance and calibration
  - Report acceptance/aspect metrics and calibration (ECE, Brier) by year, venue, topic, document-length quintiles, and parse-quality bins.
  - Add confidence-ordered risk curves and risk–coverage tradeoffs; show selective prediction: abstaining on the top 10–20% most-uncertain items reduces error substantially.

- High-confidence error audit
  - Focus on the top-decile confidence FPs/FNs; summarize dominant failure modes and provide 3–5 representative, leakage-free cases per mode. This demonstrates where the model is confidently wrong.

- Faithful attribution and perturbation tests
  - Use deletion/insertion tests and sufficiency/necessity erasure (mask most-attributed tokens/sections) to verify attribution faithfulness; report performance drops.
  - Section-level perturbations: abstract-only vs body-only, sentence shuffling within sections, header masking. Large drops under semantic perturbations indicate reliance on content over boilerplate.

- Proxy and leakage controls
  - Negative-control baselines (length/refs/authors-only) and drop-one proxy ablations; show our full model’s margin over trivial cues.
  - v1-only, venue-status string stripping, and citation-time censoring; report effect sizes to rule out leakage-driven errors.

- OOD and dependence checks
  - Leave-year/leave-venue evaluations; near-duplicate/author-linked leakage audits; report where errors concentrate under shift.

- Actionability and remediation
  - For recurring, content-related failures (e.g., originality/impact needing context), demonstrate targeted fixes (retrieval over prior art, section-aware encoders) on the audited subset and report error reduction.
  - For parse-related failures, exclude low-quality parses and show robustness; quantify residual error.

What we will add in the rebuttal/supplement
- A table of error categories with counts/CIs, plus corrected/noise-excluded metrics.
- Slice performance and calibration plots; risk–coverage curves and selective prediction results.
- Attribution faithfulness results (deletion/insertion) and section-perturbation ablations.
- Negative-control baselines and drop-one proxy ablations with Δ metrics.
- Anonymized evidence pack (examples, audit protocol, and code) to ensure reproducibility.

This package directly addresses the critique by turning a qualitative section into a quantitative, reproducible root-cause analysis that distinguishes noise from model shortcomings, demonstrates reliance on substantive content, and outlines concrete paths to reduce the most impactful error modes.
