You can keep up—and contribute—by using translation/summarization tools, curated sources, and welcoming communities. Here’s a practical playbook you can follow with limited time and non‑native English.

Make English-heavy papers readable
- Use the right tools
  - Translate: DeepL or Google Translate (copy sections; translate captions/abstract first).
  - Summarize: Semantic Scholar “TLDR,” Elicit, “Explainpaper”/“SciSpace” for section-by-section explanations.
  - Watch talks: YouTube auto-captions + auto-translate for conference tutorials/keynotes.
  - Easier viewing: arXiv Vanity (renders PDF to HTML) to copy/paste text for translation.
- A simple reading workflow
  1) Skim title/abstract/figures first; decide if it’s relevant.
  2) Translate and read Introduction + Method overview only.
  3) Look at the main table/plot; read the caption carefully.
  4) Write a 5‑bullet summary (problem, method, data, metric, key result).
  5) Add 3 questions you still have; move on if not essential.
- Build a personal glossary
  - Keep a doc of 100–200 frequent terms (e.g., overfit, calibration, prior, variance) with translations and short examples.

Cut the noise: curated, beginner-friendly sources
- Aggregators: Papers with Code “Trending” and SOTA pages; arXiv-sanity or arXiv RSS for 1–2 categories (cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML).
- Summaries/newsletters: short weekly digests (e.g., Import AI, The Batch), HF Daily Papers, or local-language AI newsletters in your region.
- Tutorials over papers: fast.ai lessons, Hugging Face Course, Distill-style blogs, conference tutorials on YouTube.

Communities that welcome non-native speakers
- fast.ai forums and study groups (many international cohorts).
- Hugging Face Discord (channels for help; some language-specific channels pop up).
- ML Collective (open Slack, paper discussions, office hours).
- Kaggle (competitions/discussions are practical and friendly).
- Local/regional groups (e.g., university clubs, meetups, Telegram/Discord groups in your language).
Tip: mention you’re a non-native speaker; communities are often extra helpful when they know.

How to ask questions (template)
- Title: Specific and short (e.g., “Help: understanding temperature scaling in calibration”).
- Context: 2–3 lines on your goal and what you’ve read.
- Minimal example: code snippet or link to a Colab/Gist.
- Exact ask: “Is my split leaking?” “Which metric is appropriate here?”
- What you tried: bullets of attempts and errors.
This structure gets faster, clearer answers even if your English isn’t perfect.

Contribute without heavy writing
- Open small PRs: fix typos, clarify docs, add examples. Many repos tag “good first issue.”
- Share artifacts: clean notebooks, reproducible scripts, and plots speak for themselves.
- Translate docs: some projects welcome community translations—great first contributions.

Writing aid for posts/PRs
- Draft in your language → translate with DeepL → run a grammar tool (LanguageTool/Grammarly) → paste into the PR/issue.
- Keep sentences short. Prefer lists over long paragraphs.
- Include screenshots/figures to reduce prose.

A weekly 2–3 hour routine
- 30 min: Skim 10–15 titles/abstracts (translate as needed); pick 1–2 to read.
- 60 min: Deep read one item using the workflow; write your 5‑bullet summary + 3 questions.
- 30 min: Watch a tutorial clip with translated captions or read a blog explainer on the same topic.
- Optional 30 min: Post one good question or a short summary in a forum/Discord.

Responsible use of tools
- Translate/summarize only openly available papers (e.g., arXiv). Don’t upload paywalled PDFs to third-party sites.
- Credit sources when sharing summaries. If you use figures, link the original.

Starter list for this week
- Pick one topic to follow (e.g., calibration/uncertainty, RAG, or robustness).
- Subscribe to 1–2 feeds (Papers with Code for that topic + one weekly newsletter).
- Join fast.ai forum + Hugging Face Discord; post a one-paragraph intro and your goal.
- Read one tutorial (HF Course lesson) and one paper/blog; write your 5‑bullet summary.

If you tell me your preferred subfield (LLMs, vision, safety, healthcare), I’ll suggest:
- 5 starter papers/blogs with talk videos that have captions,
- 3 communities to join (including any language-specific ones),
- A 4-week reading plan with concrete milestones.
