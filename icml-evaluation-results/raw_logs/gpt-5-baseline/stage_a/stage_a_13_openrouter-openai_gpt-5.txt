You can do real AI-for-health work without private patient data. Focus on public/synthetic datasets, evaluation and documentation, and privacy-preserving methods. Here are beginner-friendly tracks, concrete datasets, and a short plan.

Beginner-friendly tracks (low compute, no PHI)

1) Public health forecasting/evidence synthesis (evaluation + modeling)
- Questions: Short-term flu/COVID nowcasts; effect of simple data choices on accuracy.
- Data (public): CDC FluView ILINet (influenza-like illness), Our World in Data (COVID/vaccines, mortality), ECDC weekly reports, Google/Apple Mobility (aggregated), NOAA weather.
- Steps:
  - Build baselines: seasonal naïve, ARIMA/Prophet; small ML model adding weather/mobility.
  - Compare 1–4 week forecasts across regions; report MAE/MAPE/WIS with confidence intervals.
  - Write a concise reproducible report; no clinical claims.

2) Fairness/robustness on de-identified public surveys
- Questions: Are simple risk models calibrated and fair across groups?
- Data (public, de-identified): BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System), NHANES (tabular), UCI Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes (with caveats), WILDS Camelyon17 (pathology domain shift).
- Steps:
  - Train logistic regression/XGBoost; evaluate by subgroup (accuracy, AUC, calibration/ECE).
  - Add simple fixes: reweighting, threshold per group, temperature scaling; report trade-offs.

3) Synthetic or open medical data with privacy methods
- Questions: Utility–privacy trade-offs with differential privacy; federated learning in simulation.
- Data/tools: Synthea (synthetic EHR + notes), MedMNIST (medical images), PhysioNet open datasets (choose ones without DUA).
- Steps:
  - Baseline classifier; then apply DP-SGD (Opacus/TensorFlow Privacy) and/or simulate federated learning (Flower) across “sites.”
  - Evaluate accuracy, calibration, and basic membership-inference risk reduction.

4) Health NLP without sensitive data (eval + retrieval)
- Questions: Can a RAG system answer public health FAQs with citations and low hallucination?
- Corpora: WHO/CDC guidance pages (respect ToS; cache small excerpts), CORD-19 (open literature), PubMed abstracts (via APIs).
- Steps:
  - Build a tiny RAG pipeline (Haystack/LlamaIndex/HF); evaluate factual accuracy and citation grounding on a small, curated QA set; report error types and safe prompt templates.

5) Public-health ops data: inspections and complaints
- Questions: Can we prioritize inspections or detect issues from open civic data?
- Data: City open data portals (e.g., Chicago Food Inspections, NYC 311 food poisoning complaints), restaurant metadata, weather.
- Steps:
  - Predict violation risk; evaluate precision@k for prioritization; discuss ethical limits and deployment risks.

6) Transparency and dataset audits (high impact, no training)
- Targets: MedMNIST, NIH ChestX-ray14, RSNA Pneumonia, BRFSS, city health datasets.
- Steps:
  - Write a Data/Model Card (intended use, demographics, biases, privacy), run basic checks (class balance, duplicates, leakage), and open a PR to the repo or publish your card + scripts.

Safe, public data sources to explore
- Our World in Data (health indicators, COVID), CDC FluView/ILINet, ECDC weekly influenza/COVID, WHO Global Health Observatory, EPA Air Quality (AQS), NOAA weather, BRFSS/NHANES (microdata), MedMNIST, PhysioNet open datasets, Synthea synthetic EHR, Chicago Food Inspections, NYC Open Data.

Privacy and ethics guardrails
- Stick to public/de-identified/synthetic data; never handle PHI.
- Respect licenses/ToS; avoid scraping where disallowed.
- Add “Not for clinical use” disclaimers; avoid medical advice.
- Reproducibility over novelty: pinned versions, scripts, fixed seeds, data provenance.
- If studying failures, disclose responsibly and avoid enabling harm.

6-week micro-plan (2–5 hours/week)
- Week 1: Pick a track + dataset; create a repo with a 1-page plan (question, metrics, risks, DoD).
- Week 2: Baseline: run one model/eval end-to-end; save results.csv; first plot/table.
- Week 3: Your one extension (e.g., DP noise level sweep; add mobility/weather; calibration/fairness fix; RAG reranker).
- Week 4: Robustness + uncertainty (region/time split, bootstrap/CIs; subgroup metrics).
- Week 5: Documentation: Data/Model Card with privacy notes; limitations and ethical considerations.
- Week 6: Polish and share: clean scripts, rerun from scratch, publish a short write-up. Optionally open a small PR (docs/eval) to a relevant repo.

Communities and programs welcoming beginners
- ML for Health (ML4H), OHDSI (observational health), MedPerf (MLCommons), PhysioNet community, Epiverse-TRACE (open epidemiology tools), fast.ai forums, Hugging Face health/biomed channels, DrivenData (public-health adjacent challenges).

Tooling to keep it simple
- Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch or HF Transformers, Prophet/statsmodels for time series, pandas/xarray, Fairlearn/AIF360, Opacus/TF Privacy, Haystack/LlamaIndex for RAG. Use Colab/Kaggle for compute.
