You can make real, privacy‑respecting contributions without touching sensitive patient data. Scope your work to public or synthetic datasets, prioritize evaluation and documentation, and use privacy‑preserving methods when you train anything.

Non‑negotiables for privacy
- Use only public, de‑identified, or synthetic data. Never collect or share PHI.
- Read licenses/DUAs; follow dataset terms. If a dataset requires training/approval (e.g., MIMIC/eICU), complete it and keep data off public repos.
- No uploads of medical data to third‑party services unless allowed. Be careful with Colab/Drive sharing.
- Document everything: data sources, versions, model configs, and limits. Add a “Not for clinical use” disclaimer.
- If you ever handle non‑public data: do CITI/HIPAA training, get IRB or equivalent approval, and use secure storage. As a beginner, prefer not to.

Beginner‑friendly contribution tracks (pick one)

1) Differential privacy on open medical benchmarks
- Goal: Train simple models with DP and quantify privacy–utility trade‑offs.
- Datasets (fully public): MedMNIST (multi‑task medical images), RSNA Pneumonia (Kaggle), NIH ChestX‑ray14, Synthea (synthetic EHR).
- How:
  - Build a non‑DP baseline (e.g., ResNet‑18 on a MedMNIST task).
  - Apply DP‑SGD with Opacus (PyTorch) or TensorFlow Privacy. Sweep noise multipliers and clipping norms.
  - Evaluate accuracy, calibration, and run a basic membership‑inference attack to verify reduced leakage.
- Deliverables: clean repo, results table (utility vs privacy), short note explaining DP choices and limits.

2) Federated learning simulation with privacy defenses
- Goal: Simulate hospitals as clients and test privacy mechanisms.
- Datasets: MedMNIST or Synthea; partition by “client” sites to mimic hospitals.
- How:
  - Use Flower or FedML to train FedAvg on 5–20 simulated clients with non‑IID splits.
  - Add client‑level DP noise and/or secure aggregation (simulated).
  - Measure accuracy, fairness across clients, and communication cost.
- Deliverables: runnable script/notebook, plots of rounds vs accuracy, ablation of DP vs no‑DP.

3) De‑identification evaluation on synthetic clinical notes
- Goal: Assess off‑the‑shelf de‑ID tools on realistic but synthetic notes.
- Data: Generate synthetic notes with Synthea (or use publicly available synthetic notes).
- Tools: Presidio, Philter, medspaCy, scrubadub.
- How:
  - Create a labeled synthetic set with PHI tags (names, dates, locations).
  - Run de‑ID pipelines; measure precision/recall by PHI type.
  - Propose safer defaults or simple rules that improve recall without many false positives.
- Deliverables: small synthetic benchmark + scripts + report with error analysis.

4) Transparency and dataset audits
- Goal: Improve documentation and risk awareness for open medical datasets/models.
- Targets: MedMNIST, NIH ChestX‑ray14, RSNA Pneumonia, open pathology/retina datasets on HF/Kaggle.
- How:
  - Draft a Data Card/Model Card: intended use, licensing, collection process, demographic coverage, known biases, privacy considerations.
  - Run simple checks: class balance, potential shortcuts/leakage, duplicate detection.
  - Open a PR to the dataset/model repo or publish your card and scripts.
- Deliverables: merged PR or public card, plus a brief write‑up.

Safe, public datasets to start with
- MedMNIST (curated small medical image tasks; easy and permissive).
- NIH ChestX‑ray14 (CXR classification; de‑identified).
- RSNA Pneumonia Detection (Kaggle; de‑identified).
- SIIM‑ISIC Melanoma/Skin lesion datasets (de‑identified images).
- Synthea synthetic EHR (tabular, notes, FHIR exports).
- Many PhysioNet challenge datasets are public; MIMIC/eICU are de‑identified but require credentialing and a DUA.

Privacy‑first tooling
- Differential privacy: Opacus (PyTorch), TensorFlow Privacy; OpenDP/SmartNoise for DP queries/synthetic data.
- Federated learning: Flower, FedML.
- De‑ID: Microsoft Presidio, Philter, medspaCy, scrubadub.
- Fairness/robustness: Fairlearn, AIF360, robustness libraries.
- Reproducibility: PyTorch, scikit‑learn, Hugging Face Datasets, W&B (free tier) or CSV logs.

A 6‑week micro‑plan (2–5 hours/week)
- Week 1: Pick a track and dataset. Create a repo with README, environment, and a 1‑page plan (question, data, metrics, risks).
- Week 2: Baseline. Run a simple model/eval end‑to‑end; save results.csv; add “Not for clinical use” to the README.
- Week 3: Privacy method. Add DP or federated setup or de‑ID pipeline. Verify it runs on a subset.
- Week 4: Evaluation. Measure utility vs privacy (accuracy/calibration and membership inference; or client fairness; or PHI recall/precision).
- Week 5: Robustness and documentation. Add seeds/CIs, error analysis, and draft a Model/Data Card with a privacy section.
- Week 6: Polish and share. Clean scripts, pin versions, rerun from scratch, publish repo and a short write‑up. If appropriate, open a PR to a relevant repo/dataset.

Responsible sharing checklist
- Only public/de‑identified/synthetic data used; no PHI in code, issues, or logs.
- No uploads of data to public clouds unless allowed; don’t commit data files.
- Reproducible scripts; seeds fixed; versions pinned.
- Clear limitations, ethical use notes, and no clinical claims.
- Licenses respected; sources credited.

Communities that welcome beginners in health AI
- OHDSI (observational health data), ML for Health (ML4H) community events, MedPerf (MLCommons), PhysioNet forums, Synthea community, fast.ai forums, Hugging Face health/biomed channels.

If you tell me which track appeals to you (DP, federated, de‑ID, or transparency), your weekly time, and whether you can use Colab, I’ll suggest an exact dataset, starter notebook outline, and evaluation metrics for your first two sessions.
