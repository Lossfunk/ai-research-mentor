You can get real guidance without a formal mentor by plugging into communities that provide structure, starting with scoped, low‑compute projects, and asking targeted questions. Here’s a practical path with concrete places to join, things to do, and how to ask for help.

Where to find guided entry points (low barrier, free)
- Cohorts and mentorship-style communities
  - ML Collective (MLC): open Slack, reading groups, mentored sprints, office hours.
  - AI Safety Camp (AISC): team-based remote projects with mentors (apply to a round; join Discord meanwhile).
  - ML Reproducibility Challenge (Papers with Code/MLC): reproduce a recent paper; built-in structure and feedback.
  - fast.ai forums + study groups: supportive, project-focused.
  - EleutherAI, Hugging Face, LAION Discords: active channels for evals, data, interpretability; frequent “good first issue” pointers.
  - Identity/affinity groups with mentorship: WiML, Black in AI, LatinX in AI, Queer in AI (open Slack/Discord, mentorship programs).
- Open-source projects that welcome beginners and are research-adjacent
  - Evaluation/safety: lm-evaluation-harness, OpenAI Evals, Stanford HELM, guardrails/validators libs.
  - NLP/LLMs: Hugging Face Transformers/Datasets/Evaluate (docs, examples, small features).
  - Interpretability: TransformerLens (examples/docs), Captum.
  - RL/Robotics: Stable-Baselines3, Safety-Gymnasium/safe-control-gym.
  - Vision/geo: TorchVision, TorchGeo (good first issues, docs).
- Campus and public programs (often free)
  - University seminars/reading groups (open to all; just ask to sit in and do notes).
  - TRIO/McNair (US first‑gen/low-income) for research prep; REU lists for summer (plan ahead).
  - Google exploreCSR workshops (hosted by many universities; short, guided).

A 6–8 week starter plan (2–5 hours/week)
- Week 1: Pick a lane and join 2 communities
  - Choose one: safety evals, interpretability, vision, or RL.
  - Join the relevant Discords/Slack (e.g., MLC + Hugging Face) and post a brief intro + goal.
  - Set up GitHub, a simple README, and a “research log” markdown to track progress.
- Week 2: Do a tiny, guided baseline
  - Follow a short, hands-on course lesson (fast.ai Lesson 1 or Hugging Face intro).
  - Run one baseline end-to-end: e.g., evaluate a small HF model on a tiny task, or train ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 for 5–10 epochs. Save results.csv and a plot.
- Week 3: Claim a beginner issue and ask for guidance
  - Find a “good first issue” in one of the repos above (docs fix, small eval, example).
  - Post in the project channel: link the issue + your plan in 3–5 bullets; ask, “Does this approach look right? Any pitfalls?”
- Week 4: Ship something small
  - Open a PR (even docs/example). Write a short note on what you learned; share it in the community channel to invite feedback.
- Week 5: Write a 1-page proposal and get comments
  - Outline a micro-project (question, data, metric, 2–3 steps, risks). Post it in a community channel and invite 1–2 people to comment.
- Week 6–8: Execute + iterate
  - Implement the micro-project, keep runs small, report mean ± std, add a Limitations section.
  - Ask 1–2 targeted questions per week in the community (show code/errors and what you tried).

Beginner-friendly research project templates (no special compute)
- Safety/evals: Create a 50–100 prompt mini-benchmark (benign or non-sensitive safety prompts), run 2–3 small open models with/without a simple defense; report harmful completion/accuracy and confidence intervals.
- Reproducibility: Reproduce a small paper’s main result; improve baselines or splits; document deviations and share a clean repo.
- Interpretability: Use TransformerLens to replicate a known circuit on a toy transformer; add one ablation or visualization; contribute a docs/example PR.
- Vision robustness: Compare two augmentations on CIFAR-10-C; equal training budgets; report clean vs corrupted accuracy and calibration (ECE).

How to get help without a mentor (make it easy to say yes)
- Post good questions
  - Context (2–3 lines), minimal code/traceback, what you tried, and your exact ask (“Is my split leaky?” “Is this metric appropriate?”).
- Offer tiny artifacts
  - A reproducible Colab, a results.csv, or a 1-page proposal. People respond more when you show work.
- Ask for micro‑mentoring
  - “Could I get 10–15 minutes of feedback on this 1-page plan?” is easier than “Will you mentor me?”
- Reach out with a tight email/DM (template)
  - Subject: Student seeking 10 min feedback on [specific micro-project]
  - Hi Dr./[Name]—I’m a first‑gen undergrad interested in [area]. I built [1–2 lines on tiny artifact with link]. I’d value a quick sanity check on my 1‑page plan (attached). Could you spare 10–15 minutes, or suggest one thing I should fix? Either way, thank you for your time. —[Name], [School], [GitHub/Website]

Build your “mentors by committee”
- Rotate where you ask: project repos, community channels, conference mentoring hours, office hours advertised by groups (MLC, HF).
- Follow 3–5 researchers on social platforms and engage thoughtfully (summarize a paper in 5 bullets; ask one concrete question).
- Attend virtual tutorials/workshops and introduce yourself in chat with your micro‑project link.

Responsible research checklist
- Use licensed, non-personal data; respect ToS.
- Avoid dual-use harm; if studying failures, disclose responsibly (privately to maintainers first).
- Reproducibility: fix seeds, pin versions, include scripts and data links.
- Report fair comparisons and uncertainty; include a Limitations section.

What to track in your portfolio (compounds quickly)
- 1–3 merged PRs (docs/examples/evals).
- 1–2 small, reproducible projects with a short write-up and plots.
- A living “research log” showing week-by-week progress.
- A concise “interests + artifacts” page you can share when asking for help.

If you tell me your preferred area (safety/evals, interpretability, vision, RL), weekly time, and compute (laptop/Colab), I’ll recommend three specific repos to watch, a “good first issue” style task, and a 2-session checklist to get your first PR or baseline done.
