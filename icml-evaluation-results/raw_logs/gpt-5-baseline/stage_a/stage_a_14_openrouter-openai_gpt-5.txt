Yes—use a low‑noise, evidence‑based path with trusted sources, tiny projects, and a simple “fact‑check” routine. Here’s a concise, safe curriculum you can follow in 6–8 weeks with 2–5 hours/week.

Trust tiers (use in this order)
1) Official docs and textbooks: PyTorch, scikit‑learn, Hugging Face docs; Dive into Deep Learning (d2l.ai); Hands‑On Machine Learning (Aurélien Géron).
2) University courses: CS231n (vision) notes, MIT 6.S191 (intro DL), fast.ai Practical DL.
3) Survey papers and standards: Distill/ACM/IEEE surveys; NIST AI Risk Management Framework; Model Cards, Datasheets for Datasets.
4) Lab technical reports with code: DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, FAIR.
Avoid relying on: influencer threads, “secret tricks” blogs without code, results without data/metrics.

How to vet a resource in 60 seconds
- Is there code or a reproducible repo? If not, skip for now.
- Are datasets, metrics, and baselines named? If not, skip.
- Does it cite peer‑reviewed work or standards? Prefer those that do.
- Red flags: “X will replace Y,” “one weird trick,” no limitations section.

A safe 8‑week learning path (2–5 h/week)
Each week: 1 trusted lesson + 1 small, reproducible task + a 5‑bullet summary you write.

Week 0 (setup)
- Install: Python, conda or venv, VS Code, git/GitHub.
- Create a “learning” repo with a results.csv and a notes.md.

Week 1: Python + ML basics
- Learn: scikit‑learn “Getting Started”; StatQuest videos on train/test split and overfitting.
- Do: Train logistic regression on Iris or Titanic; save metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix). Write what changed when you shuffled the seed.

Week 2: Evaluation you can trust
- Learn: scikit‑learn metrics guide; calibration basics (Expected Calibration Error).
- Do: Compare accuracy vs AUC vs F1 on an imbalanced dataset (e.g., imbalanced-learn examples). Plot a reliability diagram. Note why accuracy alone misleads.

Week 3: Deep learning foundations
- Learn: Dive into Deep Learning Chapters 1–3 or fast.ai Lesson 1.
- Do: Train a small CNN on MNIST/CIFAR‑10 for 5–10 epochs. Log train/val curves; pin versions and seed.

Week 4: NLP/LLMs, hands‑on but safe
- Learn: Hugging Face Course Chapters 1–3 (tokenizers, models, pipelines).
- Do: Zero‑shot/small fine‑tune on a public text task (AG News or SST‑2) with DistilBERT. Report accuracy and calibration (ECE). Document model version and prompts.

Week 5: Reproducibility + documentation
- Learn: Model Cards (Mitchell et al.), Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al.), Reproducibility checklists (NeurIPS).
- Do: Write a 1‑page Model Card for your Week 4 model and a Data Card for the dataset. Add a script that re‑runs your best experiment end‑to‑end.

Week 6: Robustness and shift
- Learn: “Deep Residual Learning” (skim) plus a short robustness survey; CIFAR‑10‑C paper (skim figures).
- Do: Evaluate your Week 3 model on simple corruptions (blur/noise). Report clean vs corrupted accuracy and include a limitations note.

Week 7: Responsible AI basics
- Learn: NIST AI RMF overview; Concrete Problems in AI Safety (skim sections on robustness/oversight).
- Do: Add a “Risk/Limitations” section to your Model Card. Implement one guardrail (e.g., safe prompt or output filter) and measure trade‑offs.

Week 8: Mini‑project and sharing
- Pick one: tiny benchmark (eval only), small robustness study, or documentation PR.
- Do: Clean repo (README, env, seed control), produce 1–2 plots, and write a 1–2 page report with methods, results, and limitations.

Low‑noise sources to follow (1–2 max)
- Papers with Code (subscribe to one topic) and “Trending” pages.
- One weekly digest: The Batch (DeepLearning.AI) or Import AI (safety/policy).
- One lab blog with code: BAIR Blog or Google Research Blog (filter for posts with repos).

Communities with good signal
- fast.ai forums (project‑focused, beginner‑friendly).
- Hugging Face forums/Discord (help channels, examples).
- ML Collective Slack (reading groups, office hours).

Working in another language
- Use DeepL/Google Translate for abstracts and captions.
- Watch recorded lectures with auto‑translated captions.
- Keep a personal glossary of 100–200 common ML terms.

Safety and misinformation hygiene
- Stick to open, licensed data; never use personal/sensitive data.
- Always report dataset, model version, metric, and seed.
- Prefer survey papers and standards over hot takes.
- Replicate at least one result before you trust a claim.

Definition of done for each week
- One notebook/script that runs end‑to‑end.
- A results.csv row with model, data, metric, seed, version.
- A 5‑bullet summary in your notes.md (problem, method, data, metric, key result).

If you share your time/week, preferred subfield (vision, NLP/LLMs, safety), and compute (laptop/Colab), I’ll tailor the 8‑week plan with specific chapters, exact commands, and one mini‑project to ship at the end.
