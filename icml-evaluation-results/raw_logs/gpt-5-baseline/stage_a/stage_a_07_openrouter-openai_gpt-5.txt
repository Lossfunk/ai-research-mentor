Love the initiative. You can do meaningful, safe AI research with only free resources if you scope tightly and follow good practices. Here’s a practical path, project ideas, and a responsibility checklist.

Principles for responsible exploration
- Stay within the law and licenses: use public/CC-licensed datasets; respect API ToS; don’t scrape sites that disallow it.
- Privacy first: don’t collect or publish personal data; anonymize anything human-generated.
- Avoid dual-use harm: don’t build or publish systems that enable cheating, harassment, self-harm, or illegal activity; if you study safety failures, share responsibly (notify maintainers, avoid releasing highly effective attack details).
- Be transparent: document data sources, model versions, prompts, seeds, and limitations.
- Keep it reproducible: put code, small data, and exact commands in a repo; pin package versions.
- Ask for adult guidance if unsure (teacher/mentor) and follow school policies.

Free tools you can use today
- Compute: Google Colab (free GPUs), Kaggle Notebooks (free GPUs/TPUs).
- Libraries: scikit-learn, PyTorch + torchvision/timm, Hugging Face Transformers/Datasets/Evaluate, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Data hubs: Hugging Face Datasets, Kaggle Datasets, Papers with Code (to find tasks + code).
- Experiment tracking: simple CSVs + git; or free tiers of Weights & Biases.
- Learning: fast.ai Practical DL, Hugging Face Course, MIT 6.S191 (YouTube), Kaggle Micro-courses, Dive into Deep Learning (free book).

Three low-compute, responsible project templates
1) Safety/evaluation study (LLMs; no training required)
- Goal: Measure how often small open models hallucinate or fail safety on a narrow, benign topic (e.g., science facts or school policies).
- Steps:
  - Curate 50–100 questions with known answers from CC sources (e.g., Wikipedia) or simple safety prompts (non-sensitive).
  - Define a clear scoring rubric (exact match for facts; refusal rate for disallowed questions).
  - Run 2–3 small models via free endpoints or local (e.g., Hugging Face Inference on tiny/medium models).
  - Report accuracy, refusal rate, and consistency under paraphrasing; include a short limitations section.
- Responsible twist: avoid releasing strong jailbreaks; focus on measurement and simple defenses (e.g., safer system prompts).

2) Vision robustness on CIFAR-10 (classic, beginner-friendly)
- Goal: Do common augmentations actually help under corruptions?
- Steps:
  - Train a small model (ResNet-18) on CIFAR-10 in Colab with and without AugMix/MixUp/RandAugment.
  - Evaluate on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions: noise, blur, weather).
  - Report clean accuracy, corruption accuracy, and calibration (ECE from sklearn/evaluate).
  - Keep runs small (10–30 epochs) and compare under equal training time.
- Responsible twist: emphasize reproducibility and fair comparisons; share exact configs.

3) Data documentation and audits (model/data cards)
- Goal: Improve transparency for a small open dataset or model you use.
- Steps:
  - Pick a dataset on Hugging Face/Kaggle; review its documentation.
  - Draft a Data Card: intended use, collection, licenses, known limitations, simple bias checks (class balance, language, topics).
  - If maintainers welcome contributions, open a PR; otherwise publish your card and scripts in a small repo.
- Responsible twist: highlight gaps and risks; propose safer usage guidelines.

A simple 6-week plan (2–4 hours/week, flexible)
- Week 1: Pick a project. Set up Colab/Kaggle, create a GitHub repo, write a 1-page plan (question, data, metrics, risks).
- Week 2: Build a baseline (run one model/eval end-to-end). Save results.csv and a minimal README.
- Week 3: Add one extension (augmentation or paraphrase set or documentation section). Log exact changes.
- Week 4: Robustness: test a variant (different corruption, paraphrase, or held-out subset). Add basic uncertainty (mean ± std over 3 runs).
- Week 5: Write up Results + Limitations; polish figures/plots. Ensure anyone can rerun your code in Colab with one click.
- Week 6: Share responsibly: post to a forum (HF, Kaggle, school club), ask for feedback, and revise. If you studied safety failures, consider privately notifying maintainers first.

Responsible sharing checklist (before you publish)
- Data is licensed and non-personal.
- No sensitive content or detailed, novel attack recipes.
- Repo has: environment, data links, scripts, seed control, and instructions.
- Report includes: metrics with confidence/variance, failure cases, and a clear limitations section.
- Credit all sources and list licenses.

Concrete starting points (links easy to find by name)
- fast.ai “Practical Deep Learning” (free, hands-on)
- Hugging Face Course (free; Transformers and datasets)
- CIFAR-10/CIFAR-10-C datasets; ResNet-18 in torchvision
- Hugging Face Datasets + Evaluate; lm-evaluation-harness (for eval projects)
- Model Cards and Data Cards templates (Google/IBM papers and HF examples)

If you tell me:
- Which project template interests you (safety evals, vision robustness, or data cards),
- Your weekly time and computer access,
I’ll give you a concrete, copy-paste Colab starter, exact datasets/models, and a checklist for your first two sessions.
