Short answer: it’s emerging but not brand‑new. There are a few recent papers using graph neural networks for sea‑ice forecasting, so you’ll want to position your work carefully.

Examples:
- Arctic Sea Ice Prediction Based on Multi‑Scale Graph Modeling With Conservation Laws (IceGAT), Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 2024. Uses a graph attention architecture with conservation constraints to predict sea‑ice concentration and reports SOTA‑level accuracy. https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2024JD042136
- Deep Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Sub‑Seasonal Sea Ice: GraphSIFNet (Hudson Bay case study). Graph LSTM within seq2seq to predict daily SIC and sea‑ice presence. Thesis/preprint: https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/337fe662-1de0-42b0-825a-8ac522d9ed66 and SSRN preprint: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/b84d3fc3-21cd-4b73-94ef-3b670b38289b-MECA.pdf?abstractid=5134078

What could still be novel:
- Targets and horizons: drift/velocity, thickness, lead/ridge probability, pan‑Arctic sub‑seasonal to seasonal horizons, or navigation‑scale nowcasting from SAR.
- Graph design: dynamic/Lagrangian graphs that follow ice motion; multi‑resolution/hierarchical graphs reflecting floe‑size distribution; graphs on unstructured meshes from CICE/neXtSIM rather than fixed grids.
- Physics-informed GNNs: explicit conservation of ice area/volume/energy; momentum constraints (wind–ocean–ice coupling); boundary handling for landfast ice; multi‑task learning across SIC/SIT/drift with shared physics.
- Edge features: winds, currents, SST, shear, deformation; time‑varying edges driven by reanalysis forcing.
- Generalization and uncertainty: cross‑basin/season transfer, robustness to extreme years (e.g., 2012 melt), probabilistic or ensemble GNNs with calibrated uncertainty; hybrid modeling with data assimilation.
- Operator learning: graph/Fourier neural operators as surrogates for sea‑ice dynamics to accelerate NWP coupling.

If you share your target variable(s), region, and lead time, I can suggest a concrete modeling plan and ways to differentiate from existing work and baselines (e.g., ConvLSTM/UNet, Vision Transformers, FNO).
