Short answer: There’s prior work on RL for wildfire management and UAV coordination (mostly in simulation), but “containment drones” is not saturated. Novelty is credible if you target real operational constraints (multi‑UAV, partial observability, safety/airspace rules, comms/battery limits) and show gains over strong planners—not just toy grids.

What exists (to anchor novelty)
- DRL for wildfire mitigation/management in simulators (e.g., Cell2Fire/FireLib/WRF‑SFIRE–based environments).
- Multi‑UAV RL for fire mapping/perimeter tracking and hotspot search; much less on active suppression.
- Open environments/frameworks you can build on: Firehose (DRL + Cell2Fire), SimFire/SimHarness (RL wrapper over a fire spread sim), and evacuation/wildfire RL testbeds. These are mostly research‑grade and sim‑only.

Where novelty likely remains
- Mission focus
  - Active suppression policies: water/retardant drop scheduling with refills, coordinated line building, and wind‑aware deposition—underexplored vs mapping.
  - Joint air–ground coordination: RL that plans for UAVs plus ground crews/equipment with safety buffers and deconfliction.
- Multi‑agent under constraints
  - Comms‑limited, decentralized policies with minimal bandwidth; robustness to dropouts.
  - Battery/logistics: docking/refill spots, staggered sorties, risk‑sensitive objectives (CVaR).
- Safety and verifiability
  - Safe RL with hard geofences, minimum altitudes, and “shields” (MPC/CBF) that guarantee constraint satisfaction.
  - Formal verification or runtime monitors for no‑go zones and separation from manned aircraft.
- Sim‑to‑real
  - Domain randomization over wind, turbulence, smoke occlusion, sensor failures; plume‑aware perception.
  - Hardware‑in‑the‑loop and on‑board compute limits (Jetson/Qualcomm) with real‑time guarantees.
- Decision framing
  - POMDPs with fused satellite/airborne/ground sensors; belief‑aware edge tracking.
  - Human‑on‑the‑loop designs aligned with incident command system (ICS) workflows.

Feasibility reality check
- Technically feasible to prototype in simulation within months. Field deployment for suppression is high‑risk, heavily regulated, and requires agency partners. Start with mapping/perimeter‑tracking or hotspot triage; treat suppression as long‑term.
- Hardware: small UAVs struggle in wildfire conditions (heat, updrafts, ash, high winds). If suppression is your aim, focus on micro‑drops for edge cooling or ignition‑prevention on spot fires, not main‑front knockdown.

How to assess novelty (quick rubric)
- Problem: Is it active suppression or coordination under real ICS constraints (novel) vs generic mapping (crowded)?
- Agents: Decentralized, comms‑limited multi‑UAV with provable safety (novel) vs fully observed, centralized control (common).
- Simulator: High‑fidelity, validated spread + UAV dynamics + wind/plume + logistics (novel) vs grid cellular automata (common).
- Baselines: Beat receding‑horizon planners, coverage control, and task‑specific heuristics—not just random/MARL baselines.
- Evidence: Show sim‑to‑real steps (HIL, controlled‑burn pilots), not just clean sim curves.

Evaluation plan (make it credible)
- Scenarios: Vary fuel, topography, wind; include spotting, comms dropouts, sensor noise; random seeds for repeatability.
- Metrics
  - Containment: time to 90% perimeter containment; area burned until containment.
  - Suppression efficiency: water/retardant liters per m of cooled edge; missed‑hotspot rate.
  - Safety: constraint violations (geofence, altitude), near‑miss separation, airspace deconfliction events.
  - Ops: sorties per drone, battery swaps/refills, comms load; compute latency on target hardware.
  - Robustness: worst‑case (CVaR) performance over wind/gust distributions; performance under 10–30% comms loss.
- Baselines
  - Heuristics: lawnmower/spiral coverage, potential fields to fire edge, rule‑based drop scheduling.
  - Planners: OR/MIP or MPC with known fire models; decentralized POMDP approximations.
  - Non‑RL multi‑agent coordination (e.g., consensus/auction‑based tasking).
- Safety/verification
  - Add a “shield” (control barrier functions/MPC) in front of the learned policy; report zero hard‑constraint violations.
  - Run adversarial stress tests (gust spikes, GPS loss, thermal updrafts).

Feasible build path (phased)
- Phase 0: Partnerships and compliance
  - Talk to wildfire agencies; understand TFRs/FAA rules; plan for controlled‑burn testing with permits; adopt human‑on‑the‑loop doctrine.
- Phase 1: Simulation
  - Couple a validated fire model (Cell2Fire/FireLib/WRF‑SFIRE) with a UAV dynamics sim (Gazebo/AirSim/ROS2).
  - Train MARL (MAPPO/QMIX/SAC) with safety‑Lagrangian + runtime shield; heavy domain randomization on winds, fuels, sensing.
- Phase 2: HIL and perception
  - Integrate thermal/visible detection (TinyYOLO/ViT‑tiny) and latency budgets on Jetson‑class hardware; demonstrate real‑time loop.
- Phase 3: Field surrogates
  - Non‑fire tests (heated targets, smoke candles) for perception/coordination; then small controlled burns with agency oversight.
- Phase 4: Narrow suppression pilot
  - Target spot‑fire knockdown or edge cooling under benign conditions; strict geofences; human supervisor authority.

Key risks and mitigations
- Safety/regulatory: Never operate near active incidents without incident command; embed hard constraints and human override.
- Sim‑to‑real gap: Use domain randomization, robust RL, and MPC shields; calibrate the fire model with perimeter data.
- Reliability: On‑board compute and comms limits—profile inference, use quantization/pruning, and design for degraded comms.
- Ethics/dual use: Avoid autonomous ignition or aggressive tactics; transparency with agencies; publish safety analyses and model cards.

Pointers to prior work you can cite
- DRL for wildfire mitigation and open RL environments built on fire spread simulators (e.g., Firehose with Cell2Fire; SimFire/SimHarness).
- Multi‑UAV RL for wildfire mapping/perimeter tracking in research settings; far less peer‑reviewed work on suppression policies.

Bottom line
- Novelty: Still available if you tackle coordinated, safety‑assured, resource‑constrained suppression/mapping with credible baselines and sim‑to‑real steps.
- Feasibility: Start in high‑fidelity sim with safety shields and agency partners; plan a staged path to benign field trials. Avoid “end‑to‑end autonomous suppression” claims until you have operational evidence.
