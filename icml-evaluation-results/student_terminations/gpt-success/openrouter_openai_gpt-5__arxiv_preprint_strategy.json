      "content": "Short version: file the provisional first, post an arXiv paper that makes all scientific claims reproducible with an open reference backend (but do not link public code yet), and keep the fast binary entirely out of the preprint. Provide anonymized artifacts (reference code and optional binary) only to ICLR reviewers via OpenReview supplemental. State a clear post-review release plan in the arXiv text.\n\nHow to handle arXiv vs ICLR submission\n\nArXiv (public, pre-deadline)\n- Include:\n  - Full mathematical and algorithmic details, pseudocode, and all accuracy results generated with the open ReferenceBackend.\n  - A “Backend and reproducibility” paragraph that explains two interchangeable backends exist, the open reference one reproduces all results, and an optimized backend is an optional deployment path with numerical equivalence. No binaries, no links.\n  - A Release plan statement: when and what you will release (reference code/configs at camera-ready or decision; optional fast path later).\n- Exclude:\n  - Any links to public code or binaries (they can deanonymize and leak trade secrets).\n  - Organization names, repo URLs, or acknowledgments that tie to your lab (keep the preprint professional but not promotional).\n- IP posture:\n  - Provisional must be filed before posting.\n  - Do not disclose kernel internals; the math + API contract is sufficient.\n  - Do not distribute the fast binary publicly; binaries can be reverse engineered.\n\nICLR OpenReview submission (double‑blind)\n- Provide to reviewers (anonymized, in supplemental):\n  - A zipped, fully runnable ReferenceBackend repo with configs, seeds, Docker/conda, and scripts to reproduce all tables.\n  - Optional: a stripped FastBackend wheel/binary behind the same API, plus equivalence tests. Mark it “optional for speed, not required for reproducing results.”\n- In the submission PDF:\n  - Keep the same “Backend and reproducibility” language as the arXiv, but do not include any URLs that reveal identity.\n  - Note that anonymous artifacts are attached in supplemental; public release after review per venue policy.\n\nExact wording you can drop into the arXiv and submission\n\nImplementation details (main text)\n- Backend and reproducibility. We implement the method behind a backend interface with two interchangeable implementations: (i) ReferenceBackend (open-source PyTorch ops; no custom CUDA), used for all reported results and ablations; and (ii) an optimized deployment backend with fused CUDA kernels that is numerically equivalent to the reference within 1e-5 relative error (forward/backward) and passes equivariance tests. The optimized backend is not required to reproduce any scientific claim in this paper.\n\nArtifact and code availability (end of paper)\n- We will release the full training/inference code, configs, and the ReferenceBackend at camera-ready (or, if the paper is not accepted, by [date]), along with scripts and Docker to reproduce all tables. To preserve double‑blind review and ongoing IP review, we do not link public code from the preprint. An anonymized artifact for reviewers (including the ReferenceBackend and optional optimized backend binary) is provided in the ICLR supplemental materials. The optimized backend is deployment-oriented and numerically equivalent; its source code is not required for reproducibility.\n\nIf reviewers ask for public links in rebuttal\n- Clarify that all scientific results are reproducible with the attached anonymous artifact; the public repo will go live post‑review per policy. Offer to expand equivalence tests or move speed numbers to appendix if desired.\n\nPractical checklist and timeline\n\nBefore posting arXiv (same week as provisional filing)\n- Generate all tables with ReferenceBackend; lock seeds/configs.\n- Add equivalence tests and speed benchmarks (internal) comparing Fast vs Reference.\n- Insert the wording above; remove all URLs, org names, and acknowledgments.\n\nOn posting arXiv\n- Do not tweet or media‑blast (double‑blind etiquette). The preprint alone stakes priority.\n\nAt ICLR submission\n- Upload anonymized ReferenceBackend artifact (zip/Docker) to OpenReview supplemental; include a REPRODUCE.md with exact commands and seeds.\n- Optionally upload the stripped FastBackend wheel as an extra artifact; same API; document that it is optional and numerically equivalent.\n\nAfter reviews/decision\n- If accepted: open the ReferenceBackend repo and configs; keep fast kernel as binary or withhold per your trade‑secret plan, or file a systems provisional and open later.\n- If rejected: you still have arXiv priority; you can choose to release the reference code on your stated date or retarget another venue.\n\nGuardrails to avoid “missing details” flags\n- Every scientific result must be reproducible without the fast binary; include multi-seed stats and ablations in the artifact.\n- Provide an API contract for the fast backend (function signatures, shapes, dtypes, autograd behavior) and numerical tolerance targets in the paper/appendix.\n- Include a small parity table showing identical accuracy between backends on a subset; keep speed to appendix.\n\nThis approach stakes priority on arXiv, keeps IP protected, and stays within double‑blind norms: reviewers can fully verify your science via anonymous artifacts, while the public preprint does not expose code or binaries that could deanonymize or leak trade secrets.",

      "content": "This plan is airtight for the submission, but I'm slightly worried about the 'Release plan' date in the arXiv version—if we commit to a specific date and the IP filing for the optimized kernel hits a snag, does that lock us into a corner, or should I keep the date vague like 'upon publication'?",

      "content": "Use event-based, conditional language rather than a hard calendar date, and separate commitments for the open reference backend vs the proprietary fast backend. That keeps you compliant with ICLR norms, preserves IP flexibility, and avoids reviewer pushback.\n\nRecommended approach\n- Reference backend (open, reproduces science): make a firm but event-based commitment.\n  - Example: “We plan to release the full training/inference code, configs, and the ReferenceBackend at or before camera‑ready, subject to standard institutional IP review.”\n  - If you want extra buffer: “…or within 30–60 days of the camera‑ready deadline, whichever is later.”\n- Optimized CUDA backend (trade secret or pending patent): keep conditional and non-binding.\n  - Example: “An optional deployment‑oriented optimized backend will be made available as a binary for research use after acceptance, subject to ongoing patent review and institutional approvals. Source release, if any, will occur only after completion of patent filings.”\n- Add a process promise, not a date: commit to updating the preprint if timelines shift.\n  - Example: “We will update this preprint with release details as they become available.”\n\nWhy this works\n- ICLR reproducibility expects reviewers to reproduce results now (you provide anonymized artifacts in supplemental), not a public repo before the deadline.\n- ArXiv doesn’t bind you to a legal deadline; using event-based language plus “subject to IP review” avoids painting yourself into a corner while signaling good faith.\n- You can always post an arXiv v2 to adjust timelines; doing so builds trust.\n\nDrop-in wording options\n\nConservative (max flexibility)\n- Code and artifact availability. We plan to release the full training/inference code, configs, and the ReferenceBackend at or before camera‑ready, subject to institutional IP review. An optional optimized CUDA backend is deployment‑oriented and numerically equivalent to the reference; a research binary may be provided after acceptance subject to ongoing patent review. Source release, if any, will occur only after completion of patent filings. We will update this preprint with release details.\n\nBalanced (adds a soft window for the reference backend)\n- Code and artifact availability. We intend to release the full training/inference code, configs, and the ReferenceBackend no later than 30–60 days after the camera‑ready deadline (or acceptance, if earlier), subject to institutional IP review. The optimized CUDA backend may be distributed as a research binary after acceptance, with source considered only after patent filings conclude. This schedule may be adjusted based on IP review; we will post an updated preprint if timelines change.\n\nMore specific (if counsel is comfortable)\n- Code and artifact availability. We will release the ReferenceBackend and all configs at camera‑ready, pending routine IP clearance. The optimized backend will remain proprietary during patent prosecution; a numerically equivalent research binary may be shared under a research license. We will update this preprint once release materials are cleared.\n\nAdditional tips\n- In the arXiv version, avoid linking any repo pre‑review. State intent and conditions only.\n- In the ICLR submission, provide anonymized, runnable artifacts to reviewers; note that public release occurs post‑decision per policy.\n- If IP review slips, post arXiv v2 before the previously stated window expires with a short note: “IP review ongoing; reference code release moved to [event/window]. All results remain reproducible with the reviewer artifact.”\n\nRule of thumb\n- Bind yourself only on the reference backend and only to an event (acceptance/camera-ready) plus a small buffer, “subject to IP review.”\n- Keep the optimized backend explicitly contingent on patent milestones and institutional approval, with no calendar date.",
