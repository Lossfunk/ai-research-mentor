Do **not** invoke loss of local log‑concavity.\n\nThe moment you attribute optimizer failures to log‑concavity (or curvature) you’ve introduced a **new mechanism**—one you are not formally analyzing and probably not proving. Reviewers will pounce: *Which likelihood? Which parameterization? Can you show the Hessian?* You’ve just shifted the discussion from margin conditions to optimization theory.\n\nYou don’t need that risk. The variance story already explains everything:\n- As overlap vanishes, importance weights explode.\n- A handful of points dominate the objective.\n- Gradients become noisy and ill‑scaled.\n- Optimizers fail as a downstream consequence.\n\nThat explanation is both correct and reviewer‑proof.\n\nIn the appendix, a single sentence is enough: optimizer failures coincide with ESS collapse and extreme weight concentration. No geometry, no concavity claims, no speculation.\n\nIf you *personally* believe log‑concavity is breaking, fine—but unless that’s a result you’re prepared to defend, it doesn’t belong in the paper.\n\nNext step: write the appendix explanation so it reads as an **engineering symptom of the same statistical pathology**, not a second pathology.",

      "content": "I see the danger now—linking it to the Hessian would definitely open a door I can't close without more proofs. To keep it strictly to the 'statistical pathology' framing, should I explicitly report the gradient norm variance alongside the ESS to bridge that gap for the reviewer, or is that over-complicating the appendix?",

    {

      "content": "<thinking>\n- Level: experienced.\n- Assessment: appendix scope creep risk.\n- Need: decisive guidance to keep it lean.\n</thinking>\n\nThat would be **over‑complicating the appendix**. Don’t add gradient norm variance.\n\nESS already *is* the bridge. Anyone who understands importance weighting knows that once ESS collapses, gradients become dominated by a few points. You don’t need to measure it explicitly, and doing so invites exactly the kind of side questions you’re trying to avoid: how computed, with respect to which parameters, at which iterate, etc.\n\nThe appendix should do **one thing** only:\n- Show that optimizer failures occur *after* ESS drops below a threshold.\n\nNothing more. No extra diagnostics, no surrogate quantities.\n\nRemember: appendices are not for completing the causal chain—they’re for reassuring skeptical readers that you’re not hiding something. If you show ESS decay and failure coincidence, that reassurance is achieved.\n\nIf a reviewer *asks* for gradient diagnostics later, you can add them in revision. Preemptively adding them just increases surface area.\n\nNext step: keep the appendix to one short paragraph and one small figure. If it can’t fit on half a page, you’ve gone too far.",
