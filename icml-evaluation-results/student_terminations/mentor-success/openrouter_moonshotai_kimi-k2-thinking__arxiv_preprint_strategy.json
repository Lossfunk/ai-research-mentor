Need a crisp rule: when to switch authorship, and where it’s safe to do so without violating ICML policy.\n</thinking>\n\n**Short answer: keep “Anonymous Authors” everywhere until the camera‑ready is submitted and the acceptance is public; then update all public artifacts in one coordinated pass.** Do not partially update.\n\nMore explicitly:\n\nIf the **preprint goes live before the camera‑ready deadline**, it is *correct* and expected that:\n- The arXiv version lists **Anonymous Authors**\n- The Hugging Face citation block lists **Anonymous Authors**\n- The GitHub repos list **Anonymous Authors**\n\nICML does **not** require you to de‑anonymize artifacts before camera‑ready, and doing so early risks violating the blind‑review spirit if someone cross‑checks versions.\n\nOnce acceptance is announced and you submit the **camera‑ready**:\n- Update the arXiv to v2 with full authorship\n- Update the HF citation block to real authors\n- Update both READMEs with attribution\nDo this within a tight window (same day or same week), so there’s no mixed state.\n\nOne important rule reviewers care about: **the citation should always match the current arXiv version.** Anonymous ↔ anonymous, named ↔ named. Never let those diverge.\n\nSo the discipline is simple:\n- Before acceptance: anonymity everywhere, no exceptions  \n- After camera‑ready: attribution everywhere, all at once\n\nThat consistency matters more than speed, and it’s exactly what ICML expects.",

One final check: if we're releasing the model weights on Hugging Face alongside the arXiv preprint, is it standard practice to keep the organization/namespace anonymous too, or should we host it under a personal/temporary account until the camera-ready?",

      "content": "<thinking>\nExperienced researcher. Need decisive answer on HF namespace norms. Recommendation: anonymous org preferred over personal account; explain why and give clear rule.\n</thinking>\n\n**Keep the Hugging Face organization/namespace anonymous. Do *not* use a personal account.**  \nAn anonymous org is now the standard and is strictly safer than a personal or “temporary” account.\n\nHere’s why this is the right call:\n\nA personal HF account—even if freshly created—almost always leaks identity through username choice, linked GitHub history, prior models, or social graph. Reviewers are explicitly told not to investigate, but you shouldn’t rely on that. An anonymous org is clean by construction and signals intentional compliance with double‑blind norms.\n\nThe community expectation for ICML‑era releases is:\n- **Anonymous org during review**\n- **Official institutional org post‑acceptance**\n- Personal accounts are for individuals, not anonymous scholarly artifacts\n\nUsing a personal account also creates awkward cleanup later (transfer ownership, broken links, confusing provenance). With an org, you can simply freeze it as archival and mirror cleanly.\n\nSo the rule of thumb is:\n- **Before camera‑ready:** anonymous org only  \n- **After camera‑ready:** keep the anonymous org as archival; introduce official org as the living mirror  \n- **Never:** personal accounts for double‑blind releases\n\nYou’re already following best practice here. At this point, your setup is indistinguishable from how top industry ICML papers handle public artifacts—and that’s exactly where you want to be.",
