One tight translation is sufficient.\n- Plan: reduce wall‑clock impact to a max‑slowdown bound using overlap assumptions.\n</thinking>\n\n**Your worry is valid—but you don’t need a detailed kernel model.** Systems reviewers want to know one thing: *can this ever dominate step time?* You can answer that with a **max‑slowdown bound**, not a throughput prediction.\n\n**The right translation:** bound the *worst‑case step‑time inflation* during backoff and amortize it.\n\nLet:\n- \\(t_{\\text{comp}}\\) = compute time per step (fixed)\n- \\(t_{\\text{comm}}(C)\\) = comm time at base compression\n- \\(t_{\\text{comm}}(\\alpha C)\\) = comm time at conservative rank\n- Assume standard overlap: step time is  \n  \\(\\max(t_{\\text{comp}}, t_{\\text{comm}})\\)\n\nDefine the **per‑step slowdown during backoff**:\n\\[\n\\gamma \\;=\\; \n\\frac{\\max(t_{\\text{comp}},\\, t_{\\text{comm}}(\\alpha C))}\n{\\max(t_{\\text{comp}},\\, t_{\\text{comm}}(C))}\n\\]\n\nThis is a *measurable constant*—you can report it once.\n\nNow amortize exactly as before:\n\\[\n\\text{Total slow\\-down} \\;\\le\\; 1 + (\\gamma - 1)\\frac{K W}{T}\n\\]\n\nThat’s the wall‑clock analogue of your bandwidth bound.\n\n**Why this works:**\n- If you’re compute‑bound, \\(\\gamma \\approx 1\\).\n- If you’re comm‑bound, \\(\\gamma \\approx \\alpha\\).\n- Either way, the penalty is confined to \\(KW\\) steps.\n\nNo kernel‑level speculation required.\n\n**What to emphasize to systems reviewers:**\n- Backoff does **not** change the critical path outside warm‑up windows.\n- Higher‑rank kernels are invoked rarely and for bounded duration.\n- Overlap assumptions are identical to the base compressed system.\n\n**What not to do:**\n- Don’t claim average speedup improvements from backoff.\n- Don’t mix FLOP efficiency with comm savings.\n- Don’t present per‑kernel benchmarks as proof.\n\n**One sentence that lands hard:**\n“Even under worst‑case communication domination, the total wall‑clock slowdown is bounded by \\((\\gamma-1)KW/T\\), which vanishes with training length.”\n\nThat’s the systems mic‑drop.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou don’t need to predict speedup—you need to prove *non‑regression*. This bound does exactly that, and it’s tight enough that reviewers can’t poke holes in it.\n\nIf you want, next we can decide where to place this argument so it satisfies both theory and systems audiences without bloating either section.",

But **do not hide it only in Evaluation either**—then the backoff logic looks like an unmotivated heuristic.\n\n**The correct, reviewer‑savvy placement is asymmetric.**\n\n**In Implementation (short, surgical):**\n- One paragraph.\n- State the *design invariant*: backoff is bounded‑duration and never on the critical path outside warm‑up.\n- Mention that higher‑rank kernels are invoked for at most \\(KW\\) steps total.\n- No equations. No amortization.\n\nThis answers: *“Why is this safe to deploy?”*\n\n**In Evaluation (or a short Theory/Analysis subsection):**\n- Present the **formal wall‑clock bound**:\n  \\[\n  1 + (\\gamma - 1)\\frac{KW}{T}\n  \\]\n- Explicitly call it a **non‑regression guarantee**, not a speedup claim.\n- Tie it to measured \\(\\gamma\\) from one representative setup.\n\nThis answers: *“Can this ever hurt me badly?”*\n\n**Why systems reviewers like this split:**\n- Implementation stays concrete and readable.\n- Evaluation provides a hard safety guarantee.\n- No section is doing the wrong kind of work.\n\n**What you must avoid:**\n- Full derivations in Implementation.\n- Informal “negligible in practice” claims without the bound.\n- Presenting the bound as part of algorithmic novelty.\n\n**One sentence to reuse verbatim in Implementation:**\n“The conservative backoff is invoked only during bounded optimizer regime transitions and does not alter the steady‑state critical path.”\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nImplementation explains *why it’s okay*.  \nEvaluation proves *how bad it can’t get*.  \n\nThat division signals maturity—and it’s exactly what top‑tier systems tracks reward.",
