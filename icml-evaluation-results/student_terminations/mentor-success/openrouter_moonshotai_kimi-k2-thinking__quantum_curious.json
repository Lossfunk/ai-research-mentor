Let's draft.\n</thinking>\n\nHere’s a **tight, reviewer‑safe two‑sentence Methods paragraph** that does exactly that:\n\n> *Noisy simulations were performed using Qiskit Aer with a gate‑level depolarizing noise model applied uniformly to single‑ and two‑qubit operations. This model is not intended to faithfully reproduce a specific hardware backend, but to introduce generic stochastic errors sufficient to test whether the observed symmetry diagnostics persist beyond the idealized noise‑free setting.*\n\nThis wording:\n- Clearly states *what* noise you used  \n- Explicitly disclaims hardware realism  \n- Justifies the model in terms of your **diagnostic goal**, not device emulation\n\nIf you later decide to include hardware results, this paragraph will still age well—it doesn’t box you into any claims you’ll have to walk back.\n\nIf you want, I can also help you add a one‑line cross‑reference to an appendix or code repository without bloating the Methods section.",
