Recommend both, but define primary baseline clearly. ~170 words.\n</thinking>\n\n**Assessment:** Include **both**, but make **general‑purpose VLMs your primary baseline** and treat specialized GUI agents as a *comparative stress test*, not the reference point.\n\nYour paper’s core claim is about **model bias under accessibility‑grounded interaction semantics**. That claim only makes sense if the baseline models were *not* explicitly trained to exploit HTML traces or action logs. General‑purpose VLMs (e.g., GPT‑4o‑class models) are the right default because they reflect how most multimodal systems reason today—visually first, semantics second.\n\nIf you anchor the evaluation on GUI agents pre‑trained on DOM/action traces, reviewers will say: “Of course they do better; they were trained on the answer format.” That reframes your result as a training‑data story rather than a bias diagnosis.\n\nHowever, including one or two specialized agents is still valuable. Frame them as: *what performance looks like when accessibility‑adjacent supervision is present*. That contrast strengthens your argument by showing that the failure is not inevitable—it’s architectural or data‑driven.\n\nBe explicit in the paper:  \n- **Primary comparison:** general‑purpose VLMs → exposes bias  \n- **Secondary comparison:** GUI agents → demonstrates recoverability  \n\nThat positioning keeps your contribution diagnostic, not incremental.",

To ensure the 'diagnostic' nature of the primary comparison holds up, what specific metrics beyond success rate would you recommend to quantify the *reasoning gap* between the general VLMs and the GUI agents?",

      "content": "<thinking>\nExperienced researcher. Need metrics that expose reasoning gap, not performance. Pick 3 max, explain tightly.\n</thinking>\n\n**Assessment:** Don’t add many metrics. Add **one primary gap metric** and **one supporting diagnostic**. Anything more will look like fishing.\n\nThe strongest primary metric is **Accessibility Distance Error**: the tree distance (or lowest common ancestor depth) between the predicted node and the correct node in the AOM. Success rate tells you *if* they fail; distance tells you *how* they fail. General VLMs will cluster near visually salient but semantically distant nodes, while GUI agents should fail closer in the tree. That directly quantifies semantic misalignment.\n\nAs a supporting diagnostic, use **Role Confusion Rate**: the proportion of errors where the predicted node’s ARIA role differs categorically from the target (e.g., container vs. control). This isolates failures due to affordance hallucination rather than localization noise.\n\nIf you want a single qualitative lens, include **Error Mode Attribution** based on whether the chosen node is visually salient but non-interactive versus interactive but incorrect. Keep this descriptive, not scored.\n\nTogether, these show not just that models differ—but that they reason over *different representations*. That’s the reasoning gap your paper is really about.",
