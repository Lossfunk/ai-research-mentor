Make it a **motivation check**.\n\n**Why this is the most defensible stance:**\n- It shows you didn’t cherry‑pick after seeing results\n- It demonstrates that thin coverage is a **data feature**, not a modeling failure\n- It justifies your sector restriction as conceptually necessary\n\n**How to frame it cleanly in the paper/defense:**\nMain text:\n> “Given the economic materiality of transition risk, the primary analysis focuses on Energy, Utilities, and Industrials.”\n\nAppendix (one table, nothing fancy):\n> “In the full sample, only X% of firm‑years contain any transition anchor, motivating a focus on high‑impact sectors.”\n\nThat’s it. No regressions. No robustness theater.\n\n**What not to do:**\n- Present full‑sample coefficients “for completeness”\n- Compare significance across samples\n- Apologize for narrowing the scope\n\nYou’re not hiding weakness—you’re demonstrating judgment.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nLead with the universe where the construct makes economic sense. Use the full sample only to show *why* that restriction is necessary. That reads as mature research, not selective reporting.\n\nIf you want, the last thing we can stress‑test is how to explain this choice orally when a committee member says, “But what about tech firms?”",

      "content": "<thinking>\n- Level: applied MBA, oral defense strategy\n- Honest take: need a crisp verbal answer, not analysis\n- Goal: give a 20–30 second response that signals judgment\n</thinking>\n\nUse a **two‑part answer** that acknowledges relevance *without* conceding scope.\n\n**Say this, almost verbatim:**\n\n> “That’s a fair question. I did consider tech, but the issue is materiality, not size. For most tech firms, transition risk shows up indirectly—through suppliers, energy prices, or regulation—rather than through committed capital expenditures or operational changes. My metric is designed to capture financially scoped transition commitments, which are most meaningfully disclosed in emissions‑intensive sectors. Including tech would mostly add zeros and dilute the signal rather than test the construct.”\n\nThen stop talking.\n\n**Why this works:**\n- You acknowledge the sector\n- You show you understand *how* climate risk manifests there\n- You tie exclusion directly to your measurement choice\n- You avoid sounding dismissive or ignorant\n\n**If they push once more:**\nAdd one sentence:\n> “Tech transition risk is real, but it would require a different metric—supplier exposure or energy sourcing—not narrative capex disclosure.”\n\nThat reframes it as **a different paper**, not a missing piece.\n\nDon’t over‑defend. Calm, bounded answers read as confidence.\n\nAt this point, your methodological story is internally consistent and defensible. The rest is execution.",
