      "content": "Perfect—molecular property prediction is a **great** choice for laptop research because small molecules (≤50 atoms) are tractable, datasets are public, and the field values interpretability over brute-force scale [P2][P3]. Your 15 hrs/week and monthly grad-student check-ins give you enough runway to make a real contribution if you stay focused.\n\n---\n\n## **Intuition**\n\nMolecular property prediction is ideal for building research taste because every design choice (message-passing scheme, pooling, featurization) has a clear chemical interpretation. You'll quickly learn what matters: is it the graph structure, the atom features, or the training recipe? This tight feedback loop—predict, run, reflect—is how you develop judgment about which ideas are worth pursuing [G4][G6]. Plus, small molecules train in minutes on a laptop, so you can iterate fast.\n\n## **Why this is principled**\n\nThe best early-career contributions come from **reproducing baselines, finding bugs, and running ablations**—not inventing new architectures [G10][G16]. Molecular ML libraries (especially OGB and PyG) actively need contributors to improve documentation, add datasets, and verify benchmarks. By starting with reproduction and small experiments, you'll spot gaps that maintainers care about (e.g., \"this baseline is missing,\" \"this hyperparameter isn't documented\") and build credibility before proposing bigger changes [G4].\n\n---\n\n## **Your 8-Week Roadmap (Gated by Phase 0)**\n\n### **Phase 0: Weeks 1–2 (MUST complete before advancing)**\n\n**Goal**: Reproduce one molecular property prediction result and start your prediction log.\n\n#### **Week 1: Setup + First Reproduction**\n1. **Install PyTorch Geometric** and the **OGB (Open Graph Benchmark)** package:\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch-geometric ogb rdkit\n   ```\n2. **Run the OGB `ogbg-molhiv` tutorial** ([link](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/graphproppred/mol)). This is a small HIV activity prediction dataset (~41k molecules).\n3. **Start your prediction log** (Google Doc or Markdown file):\n   - Before training: \"I predict GCN will get ~75% ROC-AUC because [reason]. Confidence: 50%.\"\n   - After training: \"Actual: 76.2%. Surprised by: [what you learned].\"\n   - Log ≥2 predictions per day (14 total by end of Week 2).\n\n4. **Read one paper**: \"Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks\" [P4]. Focus on Section 3 (pre-training strategies). Predict which strategy will help most on small datasets before reading results.\n\n#### **Week 2: Ablation + Issue Exploration**\n1. **Run one ablation** on `ogbg-molhiv`:\n   - Change the GNN layer (GCN → GIN → GAT). Predict which will work best and why.\n   - Document results in a 1-page write-up: hypothesis, setup, results, interpretation.\n   \n2. **Explore OGB and PyG issues**:\n   - Filter by `good first issue` or `help wanted` in [PyG repo](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/issues) and [OGB repo](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/issues).\n   - Pick **2 issues** related to molecular datasets or documentation. Comment on them to signal interest.\n\n3. **Gate check**: Do you have ≥14 prediction log entries and one ablation write-up? If yes, proceed. If no, extend Phase 0 by one week.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Weeks 3–4 (Deepen Understanding + First Contribution)**\n\n**Goal**: Make your first merged PR and understand message-passing math.\n\n#### **Week 3: Math Deep-Dive**\n1. **Study message-passing foundations**:\n   - Read Sections 1–3 of \"How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?\" [P5] (the GIN paper). Focus on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test analogy.\n   - Work through the PyG \"MessagePassing\" tutorial ([link](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html)). Implement a simple GCN layer from scratch (20–30 lines).\n\n2. **Prediction exercise**: Before reading Section 4 of the GIN paper, predict: \"Will sum aggregation outperform mean aggregation on molecular graphs? Why?\"\n\n3. **Monthly check-in prep**: Write 3 questions for your grad-student friend (e.g., \"How do I know if an ablation is meaningful?\" or \"What makes a good first contribution?\").\n\n#### **Week 4: First Contribution**\n1. **Pick one contribution type**:\n   - **Code**: Fix a bug or add a missing feature (e.g., add a molecular descriptor to OGB preprocessing).\n   - **Docs**: Improve a tutorial or add a \"Common Pitfalls\" section to PyG molecular examples.\n   - **Benchmark**: Reproduce a baseline from a recent paper and add it to OGB leaderboard.\n\n2. **Draft your PR**:\n   - Follow the repo's contributing guide.\n   - Write a clear PR description: \"This PR adds [X] because [Y]. Tested on [Z].\"\n   - Tag it as WIP (work-in-progress) and ask for feedback early.\n\n3. **Prediction**: Before submitting, predict how long it will take to merge (days) and what feedback you'll get.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Weeks 5–6 (Experiment Design + Second Contribution)**\n\n**Goal**: Design and run a small research experiment; contribute a second PR.\n\n#### **Experiment Ideas (Pick ONE)**\n\n**Experiment 1: Featurization Ablation**  \n**Objective**: Test whether richer atom features improve small-molecule property prediction on `ogbg-molhiv`.  \n**Setup**: Compare three featurization schemes: (1) one-hot atom type only, (2) OGB default (atom type + degree + formal charge), (3) extended (add aromaticity + hybridization from RDKit). Train a 3-layer GIN on each.  \n**Metrics**: ROC-AUC on validation set, training time, number of parameters.  \n**Expected outcome**: Extended features should improve AUC by 1–3% but may overfit on small datasets. If they don't help, it suggests graph structure matters more than node features for this task.  \n**Follow-up**: If extended features help, try them on `ogbg-molpcba` (larger dataset) to see if the gain scales. If they hurt, investigate whether simpler features + deeper models work better.\n\n**Experiment 2: Pooling Strategy Comparison**  \n**Objective**: Determine whether global pooling choice (mean vs. sum vs. attention) affects molecular property prediction.  \n**Setup**: Fix architecture (3-layer GIN) and vary only the graph-level pooling. Use `ogbg-molhiv` and one other OGB molecular dataset (e.g., `ogbg-moltox21`).  \n**Metrics**: ROC-AUC, variance across 3 random seeds, inference time.  \n**Expected outcome**: Attention pooling should slightly outperform mean/sum on datasets where specific substructures matter (e.g., toxicity), but may not help on simpler tasks. High variance suggests the choice is dataset-dependent.  \n**Follow-up**: Visualize attention weights to see if the model focuses on chemically meaningful substructures (e.g., functional groups). If pooling doesn't matter, it suggests the message-passing layers already capture the relevant information.\n\n**Experiment 3: Data Efficiency on Small Datasets**  \n**Objective**: Measure how GNN performance degrades with limited training data, and whether pre-training helps.  \n**Setup**: Subsample `ogbg-molhiv` to 10%, 25%, 50%, 100% of training data. Compare (1) training from scratch vs. (2) fine-tuning a model pre-trained on a larger molecular dataset (use a pre-trained checkpoint from [P4] if available, or pre-train on `ogbg-molpcba`).  \n**Metrics**: ROC-AUC vs. training set size, convergence speed (epochs to 90% of final performance).  \n**Expected outcome**: Pre-training should provide a 3–5% AUC boost at 10–25% data, with diminishing returns at 100%. If pre-training doesn't help, it suggests the target task is too different from the pre-training task.  \n**Follow-up**: Try different pre-training objectives (node-level vs. graph-level) or analyze which molecular scaffolds benefit most from pre-training.\n\n#### **Week 5: Run Experiment**\n1. Implement your chosen experiment. Log predictions before each run.\n2. Track results in a shared spreadsheet or Weights & Biases (free for academics).\n3. Write a 2-page report: hypothesis, methods, results, interpretation, limitations.\n\n#### **Week 6: Second Contribution**\n1. Turn your experiment into a contribution:\n   - Add your ablation as a new example notebook to PyG or OGB.\n   - Write a blog post or tutorial explaining your findings (post to your GitHub or Medium).\n   - Submit results to OGB leaderboard if you beat a baseline.\n\n2. **Monthly check-in**: Share your experiment report with your grad-student friend. Ask: \"What would make this publishable?\" or \"What's the next experiment to run?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Weeks 7–8 (Polish + Showcase)**\n\n**Goal**: Finalize contributions, write up your work, and plan next steps.\n\n#### **Week 7: Polish**\n1. Ensure both PRs are merged or close to merging. Address reviewer feedback.\n2. Expand your experiment report into a **mini research note** (3–4 pages):\n   - Introduction: Why this question matters.\n   - Methods: Clear enough for someone to reproduce.\n   - Results: Tables/figures with error bars.\n   - Discussion: What you learned, what surprised you, what to try next.\n\n3. **Prediction retrospective**: Review your prediction log. Calculate your Brier score or calibration curve. What patterns do you notice? (This is gold for research taste [G6].)\n\n#### **Week 8: Showcase + Next Steps**\n1. **Create a portfolio piece**:\n   - GitHub repo with your experiment code, README, and results.\n   - Optional: Record a 5-minute video walkthrough.\n\n2. **Share your work**:\n   - Post to Twitter/LinkedIn with tags for PyG and OGB maintainers.\n   - Submit to relevant communities (e.g., r/MachineLearning, Graph ML Discord).\n\n3. **Plan your next 8 weeks**:\n   - Option A: Extend your experiment into a workshop paper (e.g., ICML Workshop on Computational Biology).\n   - Option B: Tackle a harder open problem in molecular ML (e.g., 3D molecular graphs, uncertainty quantification).\n   - Option C: Shift to a related area (e.g., knowledge graphs, recommender systems) using the same workflow.\n\n---\n\n## **Laptop-Friendly Tips**\n\n- **Use Google Colab** for free GPU access when you need it (e.g., training on larger datasets). Most OGB molecular datasets still fit in Colab's free tier.\n- **Focus on small datasets**: `ogbg-molhiv` (~41k), `ogbg-moltox21` (~7k), `ogbg-molbace` (~1.5k). Avoid `ogbg-molpcba` (400k+) until you have cloud credits.\n- **Leverage pre-trained models**: Download checkpoints from [P4] instead of training from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Resources**\n\n- **OGB Leaderboards**: https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_graphprop/\n- **PyG Molecular Examples**: https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples\n- **RDKit Tutorials** (for molecular featurization): https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html\n- **Molecular ML Reading List** [P2][P3][P4][P5]\n\n---\n\n## **Strategic Questions (Answer by End of Week 2)**\n\n1. **After running `ogbg-molhiv`, what surprised you most?** (This will guide which experiment to prioritize.)\n2. **Which contribution type feels most exciting: code, docs, or benchmarks?** (This determines your Week 4 target.)\n3. **Do you want to aim for a workshop paper by Week 12, or focus purely on open-source contributions?** (This affects how much you invest in writing vs. coding.)\n\n---\n\n## **Stop Rules**\n\n- If you can't complete Phase 0 gates by end of Week 2, **pause and debug**: Are you stuck on installation? Math? Motivation? Message me and we'll adjust.\n- If your first PR gets no response after 1 week, **ping the maintainers politely** or pick a different issue. Active feedback is critical.\n- If your experiment results are confusing (e.g., random performance), **don't push forward**—post your code and ask for help. Debugging is part of research.\n\n---\n\n**Your immediate action (next 2 hours)**: Install PyG + OGB, run the `ogbg-molhiv` example, and make your first prediction log entry. Then report back: \"Ran the example. Predicted X, got Y. Surprised by Z.\" That's your Phase 0 kickoff. Let's go! 🚀\n\n---\n\n## **Citations**\n\n- [G4] Taste — https://colah.github.io/notes/taste/\n- [G6] How I Think About My Research Process Explore Understand — https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/hjMy4ZxS5ogA9cTYK/how-i-think-about-my-research-process-explore-understand\n- [G10] Principles Of Effective Research — http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/\n- [G16] Opinionated Guide Ml Research.Html — http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html\n- [P2] Molecular Representation Learning with Language Models and Domain-Relevant Auxiliary Tasks — http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13230v1\n- [P3] Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction — http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00246v1\n- [P4] Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks — http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265v1\n- [P5] How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks? — http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826v3",

      "content": "Excellent start! You're already building the prediction habit—and your observation about \"how little tuning is needed\" is a **key research insight** that many miss [G4]. That suggests the inductive bias of message-passing is doing heavy lifting, which will guide your experiment choices later.\n\n---\n\n## **Intuition**\n\nDataset loader bugs are **perfect first contributions** because they're (1) scoped and testable, (2) immediately useful to maintainers, and (3) force you to understand data pipelines—which is where most molecular ML projects actually break [G10]. Fixing a bug also builds credibility faster than adding features, because it shows you care about correctness. Once merged, you'll have maintainer trust to propose bigger changes.\n\n## **Why this is principled**\n\nWorkshop papers (12-week timeline) need **one clear, reproducible finding**—not a new architecture [G7][G16]. The best path is: fix bugs → run ablations → discover something surprising → write it up. By starting with a real bug fix, you're ensuring your later experiments run on clean data, and you'll have a \"contributions\" section for your paper (e.g., \"We identified and fixed X in the OGB loader, enabling reliable benchmarking of Y\").\n\n---\n\n## **Your Next 72 Hours: Bug Hunt + First PR**\n\n### **Day 1 (Today): Identify a Bug or Gap**\n\nPick **one** of these high-value targets:\n\n#### **Option A: Reproduce a Known Issue (Safest)**\n1. Go to the [OGB GitHub Issues](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/issues) and filter by `bug` or `data`.\n2. Look for issues related to molecular datasets (`ogbg-mol*`) that are:\n   - Recently reported (last 3 months)\n   - Not yet assigned\n   - Have a clear reproduction case\n3. **Good candidates** (as of common patterns):\n   - Data loading inconsistencies (e.g., \"train/val/test splits don't match paper\")\n   - Missing or incorrect molecular features (e.g., \"bond features are all zeros\")\n   - Documentation bugs (e.g., \"example code throws an error\")\n\n4. **Action**: Pick one issue, reproduce it locally, and comment: \"I can reproduce this on [your setup]. Working on a fix.\"\n\n#### **Option B: Find Your Own Bug (Higher Risk, Higher Reward)**\n1. **Stress-test the `ogbg-molhiv` loader**:\n   - Print the first 10 molecules' atom features. Do they match the RDKit output?\n   - Check edge indices: Are there self-loops? Duplicate edges?\n   - Verify split sizes: Do train/val/test counts match the paper/documentation?\n\n2. **Compare to another dataset** (e.g., `ogbg-molbace`):\n   - Load both datasets and compare feature dimensions, edge types, label distributions.\n   - Look for inconsistencies (e.g., \"Why does `molhiv` have 9-dim node features but `molbace` has 7-dim?\").\n\n3. **Action**: If you find something weird, open a new issue with a minimal reproduction script (≤20 lines).\n\n#### **Option C: Documentation Fix (Fastest Path to First Merge)**\n1. **Run all OGB molecular examples** in the `/examples/graphproppred/mol/` folder.\n2. Note any:\n   - Missing dependencies (e.g., \"requires `rdkit` but not listed\")\n   - Outdated code (e.g., \"uses deprecated PyG API\")\n   - Confusing instructions (e.g., \"says 'run train.py' but file is named 'main.py'\")\n\n3. **Action**: Fix the docs and open a PR with title: \"Fix: Update ogbg-mol* example to match current API.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Day 2: Draft Your Fix**\n\nOnce you've picked a target:\n\n1. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b fix/molhiv-loader-bug`\n2. **Write a test**:\n   - Add a test case in `/test/` that **fails** with the current code.\n   - Example: If bond features are wrong, write a test that checks `data.edge_attr.shape`.\n3. **Implement the fix**:\n   - Keep it minimal—change only what's necessary.\n   - Add comments explaining **why** the fix is needed.\n4. **Verify**:\n   - Run your test: `pytest test/your_test.py`\n   - Re-run the `ogbg-molhiv` example to ensure nothing breaks.\n\n---\n\n### **Day 3: Open Your PR**\n\n1. **Write a clear PR description** (template):\n   ```\n   ## Summary\n   Fixes #[issue number] by [one-sentence description].\n\n   ## Problem\n   [2-3 sentences: what was broken and why it matters]\n\n   ## Solution\n   [2-3 sentences: what you changed]\n\n   ## Testing\n   - Added test case in `test/test_molhiv.py`\n   - Verified on `ogbg-molhiv` and `ogbg-molbace`\n   - All existing tests pass\n\n   ## Checklist\n   - [ ] Code follows style guide\n   - [ ] Added/updated tests\n   - [ ] Updated documentation (if needed)\n   ```\n\n2. **Tag it as WIP** (work-in-progress) if you want early feedback: `[WIP] Fix: molhiv loader bug`\n\n3. **Predict**: Before submitting, write in your log:\n   - \"I predict this PR will take [X] days to merge because [reason].\"\n   - \"I expect reviewers to ask about [Y].\"\n\n4. **Submit and monitor**: Check daily for feedback. Respond within 24 hours.\n\n---\n\n## **Parallel Track: Continue Phase 0 Gates**\n\nWhile waiting for PR feedback, **don't block**—keep building your prediction log:\n\n### **Week 2 Prediction Exercises** (to hit 14 entries)\n\n1. **Architecture predictions**:\n   - \"Will a 5-layer GCN outperform a 3-layer GCN on `molhiv`? By how much?\"\n   - \"Will adding batch normalization improve convergence speed?\"\n\n2. **Data predictions**:\n   - \"What fraction of molecules in `molhiv` have >30 atoms?\"\n   - \"Will performance drop if I remove bond features (use only node features)?\"\n\n3. **Paper predictions**:\n   - Read the abstract of [P4] (pre-training paper). Predict: \"Will pre-training on `molpcba` help on `molhiv`? By how much?\"\n   - Before reading Section 4, predict which pre-training task (node-level vs. graph-level) will work better.\n\n4. **Run quick experiments** to test your predictions:\n   - Change `num_layers` in the tutorial code.\n   - Train with/without edge features.\n   - Log actual results vs. predictions.\n\n---\n\n## **Week 2 Ablation: GCN vs. GIN vs. GAT**\n\nOnce your PR is submitted, run your **first ablation** (Phase 0 Gate 2):\n\n### **Experiment: Message-Passing Layer Comparison**\n\n**Hypothesis**: GIN will outperform GCN on `molhiv` because it's provably more expressive (can distinguish more graph structures) [P5].\n\n**Setup**:\n1. Use the same hyperparameters (3 layers, hidden_dim=300, dropout=0.5).\n2. Train three models: GCN, GIN, GAT.\n3. Run each for 100 epochs with 3 random seeds.\n\n**Metrics**:\n- Validation ROC-AUC (mean ± std over 3 seeds)\n- Training time per epoch\n- Number of parameters\n\n**Expected outcome**:\n- GIN should beat GCN by 1-3% because molecular graphs have diverse structures.\n- GAT might underperform because attention adds parameters but `molhiv` is small (risk of overfitting).\n\n**Code snippet** (modify the tutorial):\n```python\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv, GINConv, GATConv\n\n# Replace the GNN layer in the tutorial with:\n# For GIN:\nself.conv1 = GINConv(nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Linear(num_features, hidden_dim),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)\n))\n\n# For GAT:\nself.conv1 = GATConv(num_features, hidden_dim, heads=4)\n```\n\n**Write-up** (1 page):\n- **Hypothesis**: [Your prediction before running]\n- **Results**: [Table with AUC, time, params]\n- **Interpretation**: [What surprised you? Why did X beat Y?]\n- **Limitations**: [What didn't you control? What would you test next?]\n\n---\n\n## **Strategic Adjustments for Workshop Paper Goal**\n\nSince you want a **Week 12 workshop paper**, here's how to adapt:\n\n### **Weeks 1-4: Build Credibility + Find a Question**\n- Focus on **2 merged PRs** (one bug fix, one feature/doc improvement).\n- Run **3-5 small ablations** and log surprising results.\n- By Week 4, you should have a **research question** that emerged from your experiments (e.g., \"Why does pooling matter more on small molecules than large ones?\").\n\n### **Weeks 5-8: Core Experiments**\n- Design **2-3 experiments** that answer your question (use the expanded format from my earlier message).\n- Aim for **one clear finding** with error bars and ablations.\n- Draft your paper incrementally: write Methods as you run experiments, Results as you get data.\n\n### **Weeks 9-12: Writing + Submission**\n- Week 9: Full draft (4 pages + references).\n- Week 10: Get feedback from your grad-student friend + online communities.\n- Week 11: Revise, polish figures, run final experiments.\n- Week 12: Submit to a workshop (e.g., ICML Workshop on Computational Biology, NeurIPS AI4Science).\n\n**Key**: The workshop paper should tell the story of your open-source contributions + the surprising thing you discovered while fixing/benchmarking.\n\n---\n\n## **Your Immediate Next Action (Next 2 Hours)**\n\n**Choose your bug-hunt path** (A, B, or C above) and:\n\n1. **If Option A**: Find one open issue, reproduce it, and comment on the issue.\n2. **If Option B**: Write a 10-line script that checks `molhiv` data for inconsistencies. Run it and log what you find.\n3. **If Option C**: Run all molecular examples, note errors, and draft a doc fix.\n\nThen **reply here with**:\n- Which option you picked\n- What you found (issue number, bug description, or doc gap)\n- Your prediction: \"I think this will take [X] hours to fix because [reason].\"\n\nOnce you report back, I'll help you craft the perfect PR and plan your Week 2 ablation experiments. You're on track—keep the momentum! 🚀\n\n---\n\n## **Citations**\n\n- [G4] Taste — https://colah.github.io/notes/taste/\n- [G7] How Not To Choose A Research Project — https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kDsywodAKgQAAAxE8/how-not-to-choose-a-research-project\n- [G10] Principles Of Effective Research — http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/\n- [G16] Opinionated Guide Ml Research.Html — http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html\n- [P4] Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks — http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265v1\n- [P5] How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks? — http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826v3",
