Great focus. You can make real contributions to healthcare AI without touching identifiable patient data. Work only with de‑identified or synthetic datasets, follow established privacy guidance, and choose small, falsifiable studies you can complete and share reproducibly.

Work only with safe data and norms
- Prefer de-identified data: HIPAA describes two paths—Safe Harbor (removal of 18 identifiers) and Expert Determination; properly de‑identified data are not PHI under HIPAA [HHS De‑identification Guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html). If you’re in the UK, see the NHS Anonymisation Standard (ISB1523) for publishing health data [NHS ISB1523](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/isb1523-anonymisation-standard-for-publishing-health-and-social-care-data).
- Use public, credentialed resources: PhysioNet’s MIMIC‑IV is de‑identified and free for research after a short training and data use agreement; it’s widely used and well-documented [Johnson et al., 2023, Nature Sci Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01899-x).
- Start with synthetic data when possible: Synthea generates realistic, fully synthetic EHRs you can use without PHI risk for modeling and pipeline prototyping [Walonoski et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7651916/).
- Never attempt re‑identification and don’t upload any sensitive data to unvetted cloud services. Read dataset licenses and model/dataset cards; document intended use and limitations.

Three beginner‑friendly, privacy‑preserving experiments (falsifiable)
1) Differential privacy (DP) on synthetic EHR
- Hypothesis: On a Synthea cohort predicting 30‑day readmission, DP‑SGD with ε ≤ 5 reduces AUROC by ≤ 3 percentage points vs non‑DP training at fixed compute.
- Setup: Generate 50k synthetic patients; split by patient. Train a simple MLP or logistic regression with and without DP‑SGD (e.g., Opacus) across 5 seeds. Tune noise multiplier to target ε ≈ 3–5 at δ = 1e‑5 (report accounting details).
- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC (mean ± std), calibration (ECE), runtime. Reject if AUROC drop > 3 pp.
- Why: DP bounds individual influence and is a standard approach for privacy‑preserving learning in healthcare [Survey: Differential Privacy for Medical Data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257172/).

2) Federated learning (FL) simulation without sharing data
- Hypothesis: FedAvg trained across 5 “virtual hospitals” (non‑IID splits by demographics) achieves AUROC within 2 percentage points of centralized training while never moving raw data off client partitions.
- Setup: Partition Synthea (or a public medical image set) into 5 clients with skewed label distributions. Compare centralized vs FedAvg for a simple classifier; 5 seeds. Log communication rounds and total bytes exchanged (model weights only).
- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC, client‑level fairness gaps, communication cost. Reject if AUROC gap > 2 pp.
- Why: FL addresses data locality and governance constraints by decentralizing training; it’s active in medical imaging and EHR research [Survey: Federated Learning for Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05980).

3) De‑identification pipeline test on synthetic notes
- Hypothesis: A de‑identification tool (e.g., Presidio, Philter) achieves ≥95% recall and ≥90% precision for HIPAA Safe Harbor identifiers on synthetic clinical notes with injected PHI patterns.
- Setup: Create 1,000 synthetic notes (LLM‑generated or template‑based) and inject names, dates, phone numbers, locations, and IDs per Safe Harbor categories. Run de‑id, compare to ground‑truth spans. Ablate long vs short notes and rare formats.
- Metrics: Precision/recall/F1 by identifier type; error analysis. Reject if recall < 95% overall or < 90% for any category.
- Why: Safe Harbor lists explicit identifiers to remove; synthetic notes let you evaluate tooling without PHI risk [HHS De‑identification Guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html).

Optional next steps when ready
- MIMIC‑IV credentialing: complete the training, then replicate your best synthetic‑data result on a small MIMIC‑IV task (e.g., in‑hospital mortality) while strictly following the DUA. Report both utility (AUROC) and privacy‑relevant metrics (e.g., DP ε, training/communication footprint) [Johnson et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01899-x).
- Documentation: Publish a short Model Card/Datasheet‑style README (intended use, data sources/licenses, risks, metrics, seeds, hardware). This is increasingly expected and improves reproducibility.

A lightweight 4‑week plan
- Week 1: Pick one experiment above. Lock data splits, baseline code, and metrics. Write your README sections for Task/Data/Safety.
- Week 2: Run the main comparison across 5 seeds. Track seeds, configs, and resource use (runtime/bytes/ε).
- Week 3: Add one ablation (e.g., stronger DP noise or more non‑IID skew) and one robustness check (calibration or client‑level performance).
- Week 4: Write a 2–3 page note with results (mean ± std, significance), limitations, and risk analysis. Open‑source the notebook and code.

Notes
- Laws and institutional policies vary; this is not legal advice. When in doubt, stick to synthetic or credentialed, de‑identified datasets and follow their usage rules.
- Avoid reusing any real clinical text you have access to; even “anonymized” free text can leak identifiers if not carefully processed.
