I hear the time pressure! Let me help you move quickly from "any topic" to a focused, feasible thesis. But first, I need a few essentials to give you the right advice:

## Quick Intake (answer in 2-3 sentences total)

1. **Resources & time**: How many hours/week can you dedicate, and what compute do you have (local GPU, cloud credits, Colab)?
2. **Background**: What AI courses or projects have you done? Any area you already know well (NLP, vision, RL)?
3. **Thesis scope**: Is this a master's thesis (original experiments expected) or undergrad (reproduction + small extension okay)? What's your program/department?
4. **Support**: Do you have a co-advisor, lab mates, or are you solo?
5. **Biggest bottleneck right now**: Is it picking a topic, understanding what's feasible, or something else?

## Immediate Next Steps (Start These Today)

While you answer, **begin these in parallel** to save time:

**Option A – If you have *any* topic preference** (even vague like "something with LLMs" or "computer vision"):
- Spend 2 hours today: Find 3 recent papers (2023–2024) in that area, read abstracts + intro, note one surprising claim or open question in each.
- Tomorrow: Pick the paper whose question excites you most and try to reproduce *one figure or table* using their released code/data.

**Option B – If you're truly wide open**:
- Spend 90 minutes: Skim the last 2 proceedings of NeurIPS, ICML, or ICLR (just titles + abstracts of oral/spotlight papers). Write down 5 titles that make you curious.
- Tomorrow: For your top 2, check if code/data are public and whether the paper has <5 citations (signals room for follow-up).

**Option C – If you want a safer, faster path**:
- Reproduction + ablation studies of a recent strong paper (2023–2024) are totally valid theses and *much* faster than novel ideas. I can help you pick a good target once I know your background.

## Why This Approach Works

**Intuition**: One month is tight, so we need to collapse the usual "explore → ideate → validate" funnel. Starting with concrete papers (Option A/B) or a reproduction target (Option C) gives you a real artifact to show your professor *this week*, which builds momentum and lets you iterate on scope with evidence in hand rather than abstract pitches.

**Why this is principled**: Successful short-timeline projects almost always start from an existing strong baseline and add one well-scoped twist (new dataset, ablation, small architectural change). Research mentorship guidelines emphasize "get signal fast"—reproducing a figure or running a baseline is the fastest way to learn if a topic is tractable and interesting to you, and it doubles as thesis content if you document it well.

**Reply with your answers above, and I'll give you 2–3 concrete thesis ideas with experiment plans tailored to your situation within the next message.** If you're truly stuck on the intake questions, just tell me your degree program and one AI area you've touched, and I'll propose the three options in detail.
