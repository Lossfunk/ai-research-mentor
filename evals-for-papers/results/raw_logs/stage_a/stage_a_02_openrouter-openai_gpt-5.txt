Great choice—climate is a domain where even small, careful projects are useful. Here’s a beginner-friendly path that gets you hands-on quickly, with concrete experiments you can run on a single GPU or Colab.

Pick a starting lane (choose one)
- Weather forecasting with reanalysis data: Start on WeatherBench/WeatherBench 2, which provide ready-to-use inputs/targets and standard metrics for global forecasts [2][3]. ERA5 is the common data source and has clear docs and a free download API [4].
- Climate model emulation/projection: ClimateBench provides small, curated variables and targets for learning responses to forcing scenarios—lighter compute than full weather forecasting [5].
- Earth observation for climate impacts: Flood mapping (Sen1Floods11) is a compact, well-curated SAR dataset—great for segmentation or change detection baselines [6].

Minimal setup (one week)
- Environment: Python + PyTorch; get a training loop working with dataloaders, logging, and seed control.
- Data: Start with a benchmark to avoid data wrangling.
  - Weather: WeatherBench (preprocessed ERA5) [2] or WeatherBench 2 [3].
  - Impacts: Sen1Floods11 (Sentinel-1 SAR chips, labels included) [6].
- Baselines: Always include persistence/climatology for forecasting; thresholding for flood maps. These give a sanity check that your ML model is actually useful [2][6].

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments
1) Short-range global forecast sanity check (WeatherBench)
- Hypothesis: A small U-Net trained on 6-hour lead time can beat persistence on 500 hPa geopotential RMSE on WeatherBench at 5.625° resolution [2].
- Data/task: WeatherBench inputs from ERA5; predict Z500 at +6 h; train/val/test split by time [2][4].
- Protocol: Baselines = persistence, climatology; Model = small U-Net; Optimizer = AdamW; 3–5 seeds.
- Metrics: RMSE, ACC (anomaly correlation coefficient) vs baselines; report mean±std across seeds [2].
- Falsification: If persistence RMSE ≤ model RMSE (within 95% CI) across seeds, the hypothesis fails.

2) Data-efficient climate emulation (ClimateBench)
- Hypothesis: Multi-target models that jointly predict surface temperature, precipitation, and TOA radiation changes under forcing scenarios reduce error versus single-target training at matched parameter count [5].
- Data/task: ClimateBench v1.0; inputs = forcing and baseline fields; targets = future anomalies; prescribed train/val/test splits [5].
- Protocol: Compare single-head vs multi-head CNN/MLP with shared trunk; 5 seeds; early stopping on val RMSE.
- Metrics: RMSE per variable, spatial skill; compare against published baselines where available [5].
- Falsification: If multi-target training does not reduce average RMSE versus single-target across seeds, the hypothesis fails.

3) Flood segmentation with SAR (Sen1Floods11)
- Hypothesis: A lightweight U-Net with speckle-aware augmentation outperforms Otsu thresholding and plain U-Net on IoU for temporary water class [6].
- Data/task: Sen1Floods11 chips (Sentinel-1 VV/VH) with flood labels; train on provided splits [6].
- Protocol: Three conditions: (a) Otsu thresholding baseline, (b) U-Net, (c) U-Net + augmentations (random rotations, speckle noise simulation). 5 seeds per ML condition.
- Metrics: IoU, precision/recall; robustness across geographic regions.
- Falsification: If augmented U-Net does not improve IoU over plain U-Net by ≥2 points across seeds, the hypothesis fails.

A focused 6–8 week plan
- Weeks 1–2
  - Choose lane and dataset (WeatherBench or Sen1Floods11).
  - Implement a reproducible training pipeline (configs, seeds, deterministic dataloading).
  - Reproduce a baseline number (e.g., persistence/climatology for WeatherBench; published simple baselines for Sen1Floods11) [2][6].
- Weeks 3–5
  - Run Experiment 1 (or 3) across 3–5 seeds; log results; add confidence intervals.
  - Ablate one knob: input history length (weather), loss weighting across variables (ClimateBench), or augmentation strength (floods).
- Weeks 6–8
  - Tighten evaluation: proper time-based splits (no leakage), lat-weighted metrics for global fields, robust calibration metrics if doing classification [2][3].
  - Write a 3–4 page report: problem, baselines, methods, results, limitations, reproducibility notes. Release code+configs.

Practical tips specific to climate ML
- Train/val/test by time and by region where relevant to avoid spatial/temporal leakage [2][6].
- Always include physical baselines (persistence, climatology) in forecasting; they are surprisingly strong at short lead times [2].
- Consider latitude weighting for global fields to avoid over-emphasizing high latitudes in RMSE [2][3].
- Start coarse (5.625° or 2.8125° grids) to keep training fast; scale up later [2][3].
- Use ERA5 or ERA5-Land for consistent, well-documented inputs; the Copernicus API allows scripted downloads and subsetting [4].
- Keep results modest and well-qualified; state uncertainty and limitations explicitly.

Two anchor readings to ground your roadmap
- Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning (survey of problem areas and opportunities) [1].
- WeatherBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Data-Driven Weather Forecasting (defines tasks, metrics, and baselines) [2].

If you share your compute (e.g., CPU-only vs. one T4/3060) and which lane appeals most (forecasting, emulation, or impacts like floods/deforestation), I can tailor the dataset choice, model size, and exact training budgets.

- These sources are starting points; they’re not exhaustive. If you pick a lane, I can add 1–2 more targeted papers and a minimal code template.
