I appreciate your commitment to AI safety research, but I need to be direct: **2 hours per week is below the threshold for meaningful independent research contributions**. Let me help you find the highest-impact path given this constraint.

## Context Questions (please answer these so I can tailor advice):

1. **What's your current background?** (e.g., ML coursework, industry experience, self-taught)
2. **Do you have access to mentorship** or are you working solo?
3. **What's your timeline/goal?** (e.g., skill-building for a future career shift, contributing to a specific project, staying informed)
4. **What aspect of AI safety interests you most?** (e.g., interpretability, alignment, robustness, governance)

## Immediate Recommendations (branching on your situation):

### **If you're building toward a future research role:**
Focus on **structured learning + micro-contributions** rather than independent projects:
- **Replicate one key result** from a recent safety paper (e.g., a single figure from an interpretability study). Budget: 1.5 hrs/week execution, 0.5 hrs reading.
- **Join an existing project** (e.g., MATS, AI Safety Camp, or open-source interpretability tools) where 2 hrs/week of focused work is valuable.
- **Prediction logging**: Spend 20 min/week predicting outcomes of safety experiments before reading results—builds research taste efficiently.

### **If you want to contribute now without leading projects:**
- **High-quality reviewing/feedback**: Offer to review drafts for safety researchers (LessWrong, Alignment Forum). 2 hours of expert feedback can be very valuable.
- **Distillation**: Write clear explanations of recent safety papers for broader audiences (builds understanding + helps the field).
- **Tool-building**: Contribute code to existing safety infrastructure (e.g., TransformerLens, ARENA exercises).

### **If you're exploring whether to commit more time later:**
- **Run a 4-week trial** with a single, scoped question (e.g., "Do safety fine-tuning techniques transfer across model families?"). If you can't get signal in 8 total hours, research may not be the right fit at this time budget.

## **Intuition**
Research progress requires both **depth** (sustained focus on a problem) and **iteration** (running experiments, interpreting failures, adjusting). At 2 hrs/week, you'll spend most time context-loading rather than building momentum. The highest-impact moves are either (a) contributing to someone else's momentum or (b) very focused skill-building that compounds.

## **Why this is principled**
Experienced researchers typically estimate 10-20 hrs/week minimum for independent projects to maintain continuity and iterate on feedback. Below that threshold, **leverage** (contributing to existing work) or **deliberate practice** (replication, prediction) typically yields better returns than trying to lead novel investigations.

## Next Actions (pick ONE based on your answers above):
1. **If learning-focused**: Find one recent AI safety paper that excites you and commit to reproducing one experiment/figure in 4 weeks.
2. **If contribution-focused**: Reach out to 2-3 active safety research groups and offer specific skills (coding, writing, reviewing).
3. **If exploring**: Design a single falsifiable hypothesis you can test in 8 hours total, run it, and assess whether the constraint is workable.

**Please answer the 4 context questions above** so I can give you a concrete, personalized 4-week plan with specific papers, projects, or contacts.
