You can make real contributions with 2 hours/week by focusing on small, high-leverage tasks: evals (measurement), red-teaming (finding failures), and light-weight agent/guardrail tests. These areas are explicitly recommended as accessible on-ramps and don’t require large compute or long uninterrupted blocks [P5][P1][P2].

A simple 2-hour weekly template
- 20 minutes: Read one focused resource or skim an eval/red-team repo issue to pick a micro-task [P9].
- 70 minutes: Run/extend one evaluation or red-team a single behavior on 1–2 models, logging results clearly [P5][P2].
- 20 minutes: Write up results (issue/PR or short post) with exact prompts, versions, and metrics [P5][P9].
- 10 minutes: Plan next micro-step; keep scope tiny and serial (one variable at a time) [P9].

Where your 2 hours can have impact
- Model evaluations (evals): Replicate or extend a narrow eval that measures a concrete behavior (e.g., instruction refusal consistency, prompt-injection robustness, tool-use mistakes). Evals help decision-makers see risks, but measurement alone doesn’t make models safer—so pair evals with clear, reproducible reporting [P5]. Programs like MATS curate safety-relevant eval topics and examples you can build from [P10].
- Red teaming: Systematically try to elicit harmful or policy-violating outputs. Use the OWASP ML/LLM attack patterns (e.g., prompt injection, data exfiltration) as a checklist to generate test cases [P2]. Continuous adversarial testing and safety scorecards are recommended for practical assurance pipelines [P3].
- Agent safety basics: When testing agents, reduce action scope, add guardrails, and log everything; this makes experiments both safer and easier to interpret in short sessions [P4].
- Light mentorship/structure: If you want gentle accountability, look for part-time mentorship programs or communities with small-scope projects (e.g., SPAR) [P6] and roadmaps that suggest beginner-friendly projects [P1].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments you can run with minimal compute
1) Prompt-injection robustness mini-benchmark
- Hypothesis: Adding a concise, security-oriented system prompt reduces prompt-injection success rate relative to a neutral system prompt. 
- Design: Select 30–50 injection patterns across categories (e.g., instruction override, role hijacking, data exfiltration) informed by OWASP-style taxonomies [P2]. Evaluate on 2–3 models/APIs. 
- Variables: System prompt (neutral vs. security-hardened); model family. 
- Metrics: Attack success rate (% of trials where the model follows the attacker instruction), and time-to-failure. 
- Expected outcome: Security-focused system prompts lower attack success, but not uniformly across categories; some injections remain effective, motivating layered defenses [P2][P3].

2) Refusal-then-help prompting for risky requests
- Hypothesis: A “refusal + safe alternative” instruction reduces harmful outputs on risk-prone prompts while preserving task performance on benign prompts. 
- Design: Curate 50 prompts (25 risky/ambiguous, 25 benign). Compare base prompting vs. refusal-then-help prompting (constitutional/guardrail style) [P4]. 
- Variables: Prompting style; model. 
- Metrics: Harmful output rate on risky set; task success/utility on benign set. 
- Expected outcome: Harmful output rate decreases under refusal-then-help with minimal utility loss on benign set [P4][P5].

3) Agent toolscope ablation
- Hypothesis: Narrow tool permissions and explicit validation checks reduce high-risk actions without significantly lowering task completion. 
- Design: Simple agent with retrieval + calculator on 20 tasks. Compare Full tools vs. Narrowed tools + output validation checklist (e.g., “never open external URLs unless …”) [P4]. 
- Variables: Toolscope; validation on/off. 
- Metrics: Task success; number of unsafe-action attempts; time per task. 
- Expected outcome: Narrowed tools + validation reduce unsafe attempts with modest impact on completion [P4][P3].

Optionally, a fourth quick study
4) Jailbreak transferability
- Hypothesis: Jailbreaks crafted on one model transfer to others ≥30% of the time. 
- Design: Create 20 jailbreak prompts on Model A; test on Models B and C. 
- Metrics: Transfer success rate; qualitative categories of jailbreaks that transfer. 
- Rationale: Helps prioritize defense strategies that address cross-model patterns [P2][P5].

How to package contributions in tiny increments
- Replicate an existing eval with a small variant (e.g., add 10 new test prompts; add a new metric; test 1 extra model) and open a PR or write an issue with exact prompts, seeds, model versions, and code to reproduce [P5]. 
- Write a 1–2 page short report with a table of results, failure exemplars, and a one-sentence takeaway (what changed, by how much, under what condition) [P5][P9]. 
- Keep a changelog of your weekly micro-results; consistency matters more than scope [P9].

Starter choices for your first 2–3 weeks
- Week 1: Reproduce a small eval from a public guide and run it on one additional model [P5]. 
- Week 2: Add a single variable (e.g., a hardened system prompt) and re-measure [P2][P3]. 
- Week 3: Write up, open an issue/PR, or share a minimally formatted post with exact artifacts to aid reuse [P5].

If you share your preferred sub-area (evals, red-teaming, or agents), I can propose a 4–6 week micro-roadmap with concrete repos and tasks.
