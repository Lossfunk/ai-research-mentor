Great to have you onboard. A feasible beginning is to pick a small, self-contained benchmark task with clear baselines and metrics so you can focus on good ML hygiene and spatiotemporal pitfalls. Here are three beginner-friendly paths that build core skills.

Option A (easiest): ClimateBench model emulation
- What: Predict climate responses (e.g., surface temperature anomalies) from forcing inputs using simple ML models on the ClimateBench benchmark. It’s specifically designed for lightweight emulators and has clear baselines and metrics [P1].
- Why: You get a compact dataset and simple targets; you can learn xarray, evaluation with RMSE/correlation, and proper train/val/test splits without fighting huge data pipelines [P1].
- How: Start with linear regression and tree ensembles, then a small MLP; report RMSE and correlation as in the benchmark [P1]. Add uncertainty via ensembling only after you have a solid deterministic baseline.

Option B (practical next): Learnable downscaling/super-resolution
- What: Take coarse fields (e.g., low-res reanalysis patches) and super-resolve them with operator-learning ideas or CNN baselines; operator-learning has shown promise for super-resolving scientific simulations [P3].
- Why: Downscaling is central in climate impacts; you’ll practice patching, spectral evaluation, and runtime comparisons. Begin with a tiny geographic region and a short time slice to keep it light.
- How: Compare bicubic upsampling, a small U-Net, and a lightweight operator-learning model; evaluate RMSE and power spectra/spectral slopes; optionally test generalization across time windows [P3].

Option C (unsupervised): Spatiotemporal pattern discovery
- What: Cluster spatiotemporal climate anomalies (e.g., 2 m temperature or geopotential height) to discover coherent regimes; deep temporal clustering provides methods to handle high-dimensional spatiotemporal data [P2].
- Why: You’ll learn normalization, dimensionality reduction, and stability evaluation of clusters—useful across climate ML tasks.
- How: Compare PCA+k-means vs. a simple temporal deep clustering model; evaluate with silhouette scores and spatial coherence metrics; inspect composites for physical plausibility [P2].

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments
1) ClimateBench baselines and generalization
- Hypothesis: Simple regressors (ridge, random forest) can match or exceed previously reported baselines on core ClimateBench targets using official splits [P1].
- Setup: Use ClimateBench v1.0; implement ridge, RF, and a 2-layer MLP. Control for features and normalization. Train with early stopping on validation.
- Metrics: RMSE and Pearson correlation on the test split, as in the benchmark [P1].
- Expected outcome: Linear/ridge provides a strong baseline; RF/MLP offer modest gains. If your MLP underperforms, diagnose leakage or overfitting rather than adding depth first [P1].

2) Super-resolution with operator learning vs. U-Net
- Hypothesis: A lightweight operator-learning model will better preserve multiscale structure than a same-parameter-count U-Net when super-resolving coarse fields from a scientific dataset [P3].
- Setup: Construct paired low/high-res fields (e.g., by downsampling a small region/time of reanalysis). Train a U-Net and a compact operator-learning model with identical training budgets.
- Metrics: RMSE; spectral error over wavenumbers; inference latency and memory (report wall time and parameters) [P3].
- Expected outcome: Operator-learning achieves comparable or lower RMSE and improved high-wavenumber fidelity at similar compute, but performance may be data- and resolution-dependent [P3].

3) Temporal clustering of circulation anomalies
- Hypothesis: A temporal deep clustering approach yields more coherent, temporally stable regimes than PCA+k-means on 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies [P2].
- Setup: Preprocess anomalies over a fixed domain; compare PCA(10)+k-means vs. a small deep temporal clustering model.
- Metrics: Silhouette score; cluster persistence/transition probabilities; spatial coherence of composites; stability across random seeds [P2].
- Expected outcome: Deep temporal clustering improves coherence and temporal stability; if not, inspect preprocessing and regularization [P2].

Key pitfalls to watch from day one
- Nonstationarity and regime shifts: Climate and weather distributions drift; methods that assume stationarity can fail when the test period differs from training. If possible, evaluate across eras (e.g., 1980s vs. 2010s) to expose drift [P4].
- Spatiotemporal leakage: Never mix neighboring grid cells or adjacent times across train/test; keep time-blocked and space-blocked splits where appropriate. This is crucial to avoid optimistic results; when in doubt, use contiguous time splits and hold-out regions.
- Baseline-first mindset: Simple baselines often perform surprisingly well on ClimateBench-style emulation; establish them before adding complexity [P1].

A simple 2–4 week roadmap
- Week 1: Reproduce ClimateBench baselines (ridge, RF, small MLP) with clean splits and reporting [P1].
- Week 2: Add uncertainty via ensembles or quantile regression; write a one-page reproducibility note (data, preprocessing, metrics, seeds).
- Weeks 3–4 (choose one): Downscaling experiment (Option B) with small patches and spectral evaluation [P3], or unsupervised pattern discovery (Option C) with stability checks [P2].

Minimal tooling to learn
- xarray/zarr for data; xskillscore for metrics; PyTorch/NumPy for models; Cartopy/Matplotlib for maps.

If you share your compute and time budget, I can tailor the first experiment to fit in a weekend.
