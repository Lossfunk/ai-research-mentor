I'll be honest with you: **modern AI research has significant mathematical components, but the level and type of math varies widely depending on what you work on.** Let me break down your realistic options.

## The hard truth

You can't completely avoid math in AI research, but you have choices about:
- **How much** math you engage with
- **What kind** of math (proofs vs. intuition vs. implementation)
- **What areas** of AI you focus on

## Option 1: Focus on empirical/applied AI research

**What this looks like**:
- Design experiments, run models, analyze results
- Use existing methods creatively on new problems
- Focus on applications, datasets, benchmarks, evaluations
- Understand math conceptually, but don't derive proofs

**Math you'll need** (minimal):
- Basic calculus (what's a derivative, chain rule intuition)
- Linear algebra (matrix multiplication, vectors)
- Probability (mean, variance, basic distributions)
- **Depth**: Intuitive understanding, not formal proofs

**Example research areas**:
- **Computer vision applications**: Object detection for medical imaging, satellite analysis
- **NLP applications**: Building better chatbots, information extraction, domain-specific models
- **AI for X**: Healthcare, climate, education, accessibility (domain expertise matters more than math)
- **Benchmarking & evaluation**: Creating datasets, testing model capabilities, red-teaming
- **Human-AI interaction**: How do people use AI systems? What makes them trustworthy?

**Real examples of less math-heavy papers**:
- Dataset papers (ImageNet, COCO, SQuAD)
- Application papers (AI for medical diagnosis, climate modeling)
- Empirical studies (comparing existing methods, ablation studies)
- Evaluation/benchmark papers (testing model robustness, fairness, safety)

**Your workflow**:
- Use libraries (Hugging Face, PyTorch, scikit-learn) without implementing from scratch
- Focus on experimental design, data analysis, interpretation
- Collaborate with theory-focused researchers when needed

## Option 2: Focus on AI engineering/systems research

**What this looks like**:
- Make AI systems faster, more efficient, more scalable
- Build tools and infrastructure for AI research
- Focus on implementation, optimization, deployment

**Math you'll need**:
- Less calculus/probability, more algorithms and systems thinking
- Understanding computational complexity (Big-O notation)
- Some linear algebra (for optimization)

**Example research areas**:
- **Model optimization**: Quantization, pruning, distillation (making models smaller/faster)
- **Distributed training**: How to train large models efficiently
- **AI infrastructure**: Building better tools for researchers (like Hugging Face, Weights & Biases)
- **Edge AI**: Running models on phones, IoT devices
- **MLOps**: Deployment, monitoring, versioning

**Your workflow**:
- Profile code, optimize bottlenecks
- Design systems and architectures
- Benchmark performance (speed, memory, energy)

---

## Option 3: Focus on human-centered AI research

**What this looks like**:
- Study how humans interact with AI
- Design AI systems that are usable, fair, safe
- Interdisciplinary work (psychology, sociology, HCI, ethics)

**Math you'll need**:
- Statistics for user studies and experiments
- Minimal ML theory (use models as tools, not objects of study)

**Example research areas**:
- **Human-AI collaboration**: How can AI augment human decision-making?
- **AI fairness & ethics**: Detecting and mitigating bias (more conceptual than mathematical)
- **Explainability (XAI)**: Making AI understandable to users (UX-focused, not theory-focused)
- **AI safety (governance/policy side)**: Regulation, standards, risk assessment
- **User studies**: How do people perceive/trust/use AI systems?

**Your workflow**:
- Design user studies, run experiments with human participants
- Use existing AI models, focus on their societal impact
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis

---

## Option 4: Collaborate strategically

**What this looks like**:
- Partner with someone who enjoys math/theory
- You focus on: problem formulation, experiments, applications, writing, domain expertise
- They focus on: mathematical derivations, theoretical analysis, algorithm design

**Why this works**:
- Most impactful research is collaborative anyway
- Your strengths (creativity, domain knowledge, experimental design) are valuable
- Many successful researchers specialize in empirical work

**How to find collaborators**:
- Join research groups with diverse skill sets
- Be upfront about your strengths (e.g., "I'm great at experimental design and coding, less strong on theory")
- Look for interdisciplinary labs (AI + medicine, AI + climate, etc.)

## What you CAN'T avoid (minimum math for AI research)

Even in the most applied areas, you'll need:

1. **Conceptual understanding** of:
   - How neural networks learn (backpropagation intuition)
   - What loss functions, gradients, optimization mean
   - Basic probability (distributions, expectation)
   - Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)

2. **Ability to read papers**:
   - Skim equations for intuition (you don't need to derive them)
   - Understand experimental setups and results
   - Focus on figures, tables, and conclusions

3. **Statistical literacy**:
   - Understand significance testing, confidence intervals
   - Interpret experimental results correctly
   - Avoid common pitfalls (p-hacking, overfitting)

**Good news**: You can learn these **intuitively** without heavy proof-based courses.

## Practical learning path (math-light)

If you want to minimize math while still doing AI research:

### **Phase 1: Intuitive ML foundations (2-3 months)**

**Resources that minimize math**:
- **[Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/)**: Code-first, minimal math, very practical
- **[3Blue1Brown Neural Networks series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)**: Visual, intuitive explanations
- **[StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer)**: Statistics and ML explained simply

**Avoid** (for now):
- Proof-heavy textbooks (Bishop, Murphy)
- Courses focused on mathematical foundations (unless you change your mind)

### **Phase 2: Pick an application area (1 month)**

Choose based on **interest + domain knowledge**, not math:
- Healthcare AI (if you know biology/medicine)
- Climate AI (if you care about environment)
- Education AI (if you have teaching experience)
- Creative AI (art, music, writing)

### **Phase 3: Build projects (ongoing)**

- Replicate applied papers in your chosen area
- Focus on datasets, experiments, evaluation
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Write up results (blog posts → papers)

## Honest self-assessment questions

Before committing to AI research, ask yourself:

1. **Is it the math itself, or how it's taught?**
   - If you hate proofs but like intuition → empirical AI research is fine
   - If you hate all quantitative thinking → AI research might be a poor fit

2. **Can you tolerate some math for a goal you care about?**
   - You don't need to love math, but you need to engage with it occasionally
   - Think of it as a tool, not the focus

3. **What are your actual strengths?**
   - Coding? Domain expertise? Experimental design? Communication?
   - Build a research profile around those

4. **Are you willing to collaborate?**
   - If yes, you can offload heavy math to collaborators
   - If you want to work solo, you'll need more math

## My recommendation

**If you hate math but want to do AI research**:

1. **Focus on applied/empirical research** in a domain you care about
2. **Learn math intuitively** (visual, code-based) to the minimum needed
3. **Collaborate** with theory-oriented researchers
4. **Play to your strengths**: experimental design, domain knowledge, communication, coding

**You can absolutely have a successful AI research career without loving math**, but you need to:
- Choose your research area strategically
- Accept that you'll encounter some math (learn to skim/interpret it)
- Build complementary skills (domain expertise, engineering, communication)

## Concrete next steps

1. **This week**: Watch 3Blue1Brown's neural network series (4 videos, ~1 hour total) to see if intuitive math is tolerable
2. **This month**: Take fast.ai Part 1 (practical, minimal math) and build one project
3. **Next 3 months**: Pick an application area and read 10 applied papers in that domain
4. **Reassess**: Do you enjoy the work? Can you tolerate the math level? Adjust accordingly.

**Question for you**: What specifically do you hate about math? Is it:
- Abstract proofs and theory?
- Tedious calculations?
- The way it's taught (boring lectures)?
- Feeling like you're "bad at it"?
