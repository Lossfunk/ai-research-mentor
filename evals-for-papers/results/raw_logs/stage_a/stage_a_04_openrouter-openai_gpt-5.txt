Two hours per week is enough to contribute if you pick small, high-leverage tasks and ship something every session. The most time-efficient entry point is evaluations and simple, falsifiable interventions on standard safety benchmarks (truthfulness and toxicity), with short write-ups and small PRs to eval repos.

A repeatable 2-hour/week cadence
- Session structure (repeat weekly):
  - 20 min: skim one paper section or benchmark card to clarify task and metrics [1][4].
  - 60 min: run or extend a tiny evaluation (subset of 50–200 items) on a local or API model.
  - 30 min: log results (configs, seeds, prompts), make a reproducible notebook, and draft a 5–10 sentence write-up.
  - 10 min: file an issue or draft a PR in an eval repo or share a short note.

Where to focus first
- Truthfulness: TruthfulQA (MC and generation) is a standard dataset for measuring whether models produce widely repeated falsehoods [1]. Beware that simple heuristics can “game” parts of the dataset; design your evaluation to avoid these pitfalls [2].
- Toxicity: RealToxicityPrompts evaluates the tendency of models to degenerate into toxic outputs when given innocuous prompts [4][5].
- Alignment interventions: Light-weight techniques like system prompts, decoding settings, or self-consistency are easy to test and compare. RLHF is a common alignment approach and improved helpfulness/harmlessness in practice, but reproducing it fully is heavy; you can still evaluate its effects using public models or APIs [6].

Three concrete, falsifiable mini-experiments (each fits 1–2 sessions)
1) System-prompt guardrails on TruthfulQA (multiple-choice)
- Hypothesis: Adding a brief “be careful, avoid myths” system prompt increases MC accuracy on a 100-question TruthfulQA subset by ≥5 percentage points versus a neutral system prompt, under identical decoding settings [1].
- Setup: Use the MC subset; sample 100 questions uniformly across categories. Compare two prompts with the same model and decoding. Fix temperature and top-p. 5 seeds (varying sampling seeds).
- Metrics: MC accuracy (mean ± std). Significance: paired t-test across questions (p < 0.05). Reject if <5 pp gain or not significant.
- Rationale: TruthfulQA explicitly targets common misconceptions; guardrail prompts should reduce falsehoods if effective [1]. Also watch for heuristic shortcuts that inflate scores without genuine truthfulness [2].

2) Decoding for toxicity mitigation on RealToxicityPrompts
- Hypothesis: Lowering temperature (e.g., 0.2 vs 0.8) at fixed top-p reduces mean toxicity score by ≥10% on a 200-prompt sample, with ≤5% loss in average continuation length [4][5].
- Setup: Randomly sample 200 prompts. Generate continuations with two decoding settings. Score toxicity with a standard classifier (e.g., Detoxify) or follow the dataset’s evaluation guidance. Control for max tokens.
- Metrics: Mean toxicity score, continuation length; report mean ± std and a paired test. Reject if toxicity reduction <10% or if length drops >5% (indicating trivial truncation).

3) Self-consistency for truthfulness on TruthfulQA (MC)
- Hypothesis: Majority vote over 5 stochastic samples (temperature 0.7, fixed top-p) yields ≥3 percentage points higher MC accuracy than greedy decoding on the same 100-question subset [1].
- Setup: Same 100-question subset and model as in experiment 1. Compare greedy vs 5-sample majority vote. Fix all other settings; 5 random seeds for sampling order.
- Metrics: MC accuracy, across-seed variance. Reject if gain <3 pp or not significant.
- Caveat: A recent critique shows some heuristics can exploit dataset artifacts; confirm that gains persist across categories, not just a few easy ones [2].

What to do with the results
- Publish a minimal, reproducible artifact: one notebook + a short README (task, hypothesis, setup, metrics, results, caveats).
- Open a small PR to an evaluation repo (e.g., adding your prompt intervention as a new eval or adding scripts to reproduce your subset runs), or share a brief note summarizing findings and limitations. This is tangible and useful to others.
- Iterate next week: swap one ingredient (prompt wording, decoding, subset, or model) and re-run.

Why this matters
- Safety progress needs careful measurement and small, honest baselines. Truthfulness and toxicity are core safety facets with established, peer-reviewed benchmarks [1][4]. RLHF-style alignment methods aim to reduce harmful or untruthful outputs; you can empirically test whether simple interventions approximate some of those gains on public models [6].

If you tell me what model access you have (open-source vs API), I’ll tailor the exact prompts, decoding configs, and ready-to-run code for one of the experiments above.
