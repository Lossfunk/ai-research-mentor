## **Intuition**
Physics trains you to build models from first principles, derive predictions, and test them—exactly the mindset AI research needs [G13]. The key is translating that skill from continuous equations to discrete algorithms and empirical validation on messy data. Your instinct to formalize and simplify will serve you well once you learn the domain's core tools and open problems.

## **Why this is principled**
Successful field transitions prioritize hands-on building over passive reading [G10]. Starting with reproduction and small experiments builds intuition faster than surveying literature, and your physics background gives you an edge in mathematical rigor and hypothesis-driven thinking [G9][G13].

Before I give you a concrete roadmap, I need to understand your situation:

1. **Resources & Time**: How much GPU compute do you have access to (personal, lab cluster, cloud credits)? How many hours per week can you dedicate to this transition?

2. **Current Context**: Are you still finishing your physics PhD, or already done? Do you have an advisor or collaborators interested in AI, or are you going solo?

3. **Target & Timeline**: What's driving this switch—a specific problem area (e.g., physics-inspired AI, interpretability, generative models), or general interest? Any target milestones (job market, paper deadline)?

4. **Biggest Bottleneck**: What feels most daunting right now—learning the math/code, choosing a problem, or something else?

## **Immediate Next Steps (While I Wait for Your Answers)**

Here's a **Phase 0 plan (≤14 days)** you can start right now, regardless of your answers above:

### **Week 1: Build Intuition Through Reproduction**
- **Pick one canonical result** to reproduce from scratch: train a small transformer on a toy task (e.g., character-level language modeling on a tiny dataset) or implement a simple diffusion model. Use existing tutorials (Karpathy's "minGPT" or Hugging Face guides) but type every line yourself [G6][G10].
- **Keep a prediction log**: Before each training run, write down what you expect (loss curve shape, failure modes). After, note what surprised you. Aim for 7+ entries this week.

### **Week 2: Run One Ablation**
- **Modify your reproduction**: change one thing (architecture tweak, learning rate schedule, data augmentation) and predict the outcome before running it. Document whether your intuition was right [G13].
- **Write a 1-page experiment card**: Hypothesis, setup, metrics, results, interpretation. This is your first artifact.

### **Deliverables to Gate Further Planning**
1. A working reproduction (code + trained model) with ≤10% gap from reported performance.
2. Prediction log with ≥7 entries.
3. One experiment card with an ablation or negative result.

Once you complete these and answer the questions above, I'll tailor a longer-term plan (problem selection, literature anchors, collaboration strategy) to your specific constraints.

## **Why Start Here?**
Physics PhDs often over-index on theory and under-invest in empirical iteration [G4][G13]. AI research rewards fast feedback loops: you need to *feel* how models behave, not just read about them. Reproduction builds that intuition in days, not months, and gives you a concrete artifact to discuss with potential collaborators or advisors.
