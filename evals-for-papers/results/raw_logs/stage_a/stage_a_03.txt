Great move—your physics toolkit (mathematical modeling, data analysis, coding, and experiment design) transfers directly to AI/ML. The fastest on-ramp is project-first learning with rigorous, falsifiable experiments and tight feedback loops rather than long pre-reading phases [G3][G10]. Below is a focused 10–12 week plan plus experiment ideas and literature anchors.

Project-first roadmap (10–12 weeks)
- Weeks 1–2: Get fluent with the stack
  - Python/PyTorch: write a minimal training loop (linear/logistic regression → MLP). Track loss curves and accuracy, log seeds/configs for reproducibility [G1][G16].
  - Tools: GitHub repo, virtual env, basic unit tests, W&B or TensorBoard for experiment tracking. Define success metrics upfront; write a 1-page experiment plan (hypotheses, variables, metrics) before coding [G1][G6].
- Weeks 3–5: Reproduce a baseline end-to-end
  - Choose one: a small RL baseline (PPO on CartPole/Atari), a diffusion baseline on CIFAR-10 (pretrained configs exist), or a scientific-ML task (PINN on 1D Burgers’ or a neural-operator on Darcy flow). Keep the scope tight and document all deviations from the paper/code [G3][G1].
- Weeks 6–8: Extend with one principled ablation
  - Example: add uncertainty quantification to a physics-informed model; or compare data vs. physics-loss weighting schedules in PINNs; or measure batch size/optimizer effects on RL sample efficiency. Pre-register metrics and compute budget to avoid p-hacking [G1][G9].
- Weeks 9–12: Write and polish a portfolio artifact
  - 4–6 page report (problem, method, experiments, failure analysis), open-source code with a one-command repro script, wandb runs, and a concise README. Clear framing and claims increase impact and credibility [G4][G3][G4].

Where to focus (pick one lane to start)
- Scientific ML (good fit for physics)
  - Physics-informed and operator-learning approaches for PDEs/dynamics; start from neural operators and physics-informed architectures that handle uncertainty and reliability [P2][P4].
- Core methods or applied modeling
  - Modern deep learning (transformers, diffusion, self-supervision), or applied modeling for a domain you care about. Keep problem framing and evaluation crisp to avoid vanity metrics [G6][G3].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Uncertainty-aware control with learned dynamics
   - Based on probabilistic dynamics/control work [P1].
   - Hypothesis: Modeling epistemic uncertainty improves stability and reward vs. deterministic models on non-linear control benchmarks (e.g., Pendulum, CartPole swing-up).
   - Variables: probabilistic vs. deterministic dynamics model; uncertainty penalty weight; planning horizon.
   - Metrics: episode return, failure rate, constraint violations; calibration (ECE) of predictive uncertainty.
   - Expected outcome: probabilistic model yields higher return and fewer constraint violations under model misspecification [P1].

2) Curriculum weighting in physics-informed learning
   - Inspired by physics-informed architectures and UQ in scientific ML [P4].
   - Hypothesis: A curriculum that increases physics-loss weight over time reduces solution error for PDEs (1D Burgers’) compared to fixed weighting.
   - Variables: loss weighting schedule (fixed vs. linear ramp vs. cosine); boundary-condition noise.
   - Metrics: L2 solution error vs. ground truth, residual norms, wall-clock to a target error.
   - Expected outcome: curriculum weighting achieves lower error at equal or lower compute on noisy/limited data [P4].

3) Probabilistic neural operators for functional UQ
   - Build on probabilistic neural operators [P2].
   - Hypothesis: Probabilistic neural operators produce better-calibrated predictive distributions for PDE solution fields than deterministic operators at fixed parameter count.
   - Variables: deterministic vs. probabilistic head; prior choices; KL weight.
   - Metrics: field-wise negative log-likelihood, CRPS, calibration plots, and RMSE.
   - Expected outcome: improved NLL/CRPS and calibration with comparable RMSE [P2].

How to pick problems and evaluate rigorously
- Choose tractable, high-signal problems and define success before you start; avoid broad, seductive questions without concrete measurement plans [G3][G5].
- Keep experiments crisp: one hypothesis at a time, with ablations and strong baselines; preregister metrics/compute budgets for reproducibility [G1][G16].
- Iterate in short loops (explore → understand), collect frequent feedback, and build research taste via many small, scoped projects [G10][G14][G17][G13].

A minimal starter reading pack
- Methodology and process
  - Schulman’s Opinionated Guide to ML Research (project-first, crisp experiments) [G3].
  - Nielsen’s Principles of Effective Research (focus and feedback loops) [G10].
  - Reproducibility/best practices checklists [G1][G16].
- Scientific ML anchors
  - Probabilistic neural operators for functional UQ (neural operators + uncertainty) [P2].
  - Efficient UQ with differentiable physics-informed ML architectures [P4].
- Optional breadth after your first project: transformers, diffusion, RL. Apply the same experiment discipline (explicit hypotheses, baselines, ablations) to avoid “training until it works” [G3][G1].

What I’d do this week
- Pick a lane (scientific ML vs. core methods vs. applied) and a single benchmark problem.
- Draft a 1-page experiment plan (hypothesis, variables, metrics, compute budget) [G1][G3].
- Implement a minimal PyTorch training loop and run your first baseline with tracked seeds and logs [G1].
- Set up a public repo and a short logbook; plan 2–3 ablations you can finish in 10–14 days [G10][G14].

If you share your physics area (e.g., fluids, plasma, condensed matter), I can suggest a first benchmark and a paper to reproduce next.
