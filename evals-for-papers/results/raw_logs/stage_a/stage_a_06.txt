I appreciate your honesty—this is a common tension, and it's worth unpacking what "hating math" means for you before we chart a path forward.

**First, let me collect some context to give you tailored advice:**

1. **What specifically do you dislike about math?** Is it:
   - Formal proofs and theorem-proving?
   - Calculus and optimization derivations?
   - Linear algebra and matrix manipulations?
   - Statistics and probability theory?
   - All of the above, or something else?

2. **What draws you to AI research?** (e.g., building systems that work, understanding intelligence, solving real-world problems, creative exploration)

3. **Resources & timeline:**
   - Weekly time budget for research?
   - Access to compute (personal GPU, cloud credits, institutional cluster)?
   - Current role (student, industry, self-directed)?

4. **Collaboration context:**
   - Do you have access to mentors, co-authors, or study groups?
   - Comfortable working solo or prefer teams?

5. **Biggest current bottleneck?** (e.g., "I don't know where to start," "I freeze when I see equations," "I can't tell good problems from bad ones")

**Intuition:**  
AI research exists on a spectrum from math-heavy theory to empirical engineering. Many impactful contributions come from careful experimentation, system design, dataset curation, and interpretability work—areas where mathematical fluency helps but isn't the primary bottleneck. Your aversion might point you toward empirical, applied, or human-centered subfields rather than being a disqualifier.

**Why this is principled:**  
Research mentorship literature emphasizes *comparative advantage* and *taste development*—find problems where your unique skills (coding, domain knowledge, design intuition) matter more than your weaknesses. Hamming's "You and Your Research" argues that the best work often comes from leaning into what you find natural and enjoyable, then acquiring just enough adjacent skills to execute. Many successful AI researchers (especially in NLP, RL applications, interpretability, and human-AI interaction) rely more on experimental rigor and conceptual clarity than on novel math.
