Excellent! There's a vibrant community around ML for climate. Here's a **concrete roadmap** tailored for beginners:

## 1. Start with Structured Learning

**Climate Change AI (CCAI)** is the main hub for this field:
- **[Tutorials](https://www.climatechange.ai/tutorials)**: They offer hands-on tutorials specifically on ML for climate applications
- **[Weather and Climate Forecasting Tutorial](https://www.climatechange.ai/blog/2024-02-07-forecast-tutorials)**: A recent 2024 resource for getting started with ML-based forecasting
- **Summer School materials**: Check out [notes from the 2024 CCAI Summer School](https://amirpasha.me/ccai_summer_school/) for curated learning paths

## 2. Beginner-Friendly Project Ideas

Start with **accessible datasets and well-defined problems**:

**Easy entry points:**
- **Energy forecasting**: Predict solar/wind power generation from weather data
- **Extreme weather detection**: Classify hurricanes, floods, or heatwaves in satellite imagery
- **Carbon footprint estimation**: Build models to estimate emissions from activity data
- **Climate data gap-filling**: Use ML to interpolate missing values in temperature/precipitation records

**Good starter datasets** (from multiple sources):
- ERA5 reanalysis data (weather/climate variables)
- Satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel for land use/deforestation)
- Energy grid data (for renewable forecasting)
- See [10 free climate datasets for ML](https://www.deepchecks.com/free-climate-environment-datasets/)

## 3. Build Foundational Skills First

Since you're new to ML, I recommend this sequence:

**Month 1-2: ML Basics**
- Complete a beginner course (Fast.ai or Andrew Ng's ML course)
- Learn Python + PyTorch/TensorFlow basics
- Understand: regression, classification, neural networks

**Month 3: Domain Knowledge**
- Read introductory climate science (e.g., IPCC reports summaries)
- Understand common climate data formats (NetCDF, GRIB)
- Learn basic climate metrics (temperature anomalies, precipitation patterns)

**Month 4+: First Project**
- Pick one simple problem (e.g., "predict tomorrow's temperature from historical data")
- Use a public dataset
- Implement a baseline model, then try improving it
- Document your work (GitHub repo + blog post)

## 4. Engage with the Community

- **Workshops**: [ICLR](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/iclr2024) and NeurIPS host annual "Tackling Climate Change with ML" workshops
- **Papers**: Browse the [ClimateSet dataset paper](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/73703) and similar recent work to see what problems people are tackling
- **Forums**: Join Climate Change AI's Slack/Discord communities

## 5. A Concrete First Project (Next 2 Weeks)

Here's something you can start **right now**:

1. **Goal**: Predict daily temperature using historical weather data
2. **Dataset**: Download ERA5 data (free from Copernicus Climate Data Store)
3. **Model**: Start with simple linear regression, then try a basic neural network
4. **Tools**: Python + pandas + scikit-learn (or PyTorch)
5. **Outcome**: A Jupyter notebook showing your predictions vs. actual temperatures

This will teach you:
- How to work with climate data formats
- Basic time-series forecasting
- Model evaluation for climate problems

## Key Takeaway

**Start small and practical.** You don't need to solve climate change in your first project—focus on learning the tools and understanding one specific problem deeply. The field values both novel research *and* solid applications of existing methods to new climate problems.
