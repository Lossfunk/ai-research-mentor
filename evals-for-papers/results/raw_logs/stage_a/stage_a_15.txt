Great question. You can get started remotely by anchoring yourself in open communities, making small, visible contributions, and using lightweight mentorship via code review and study groups. Below is a pragmatic, remote-first plan.

Where to find remote AI projects and mentorship-like communities
- Open-source AI orgs (active discussion + beginner-friendly issues):
  - Hugging Face (forum + GitHub: https://discuss.huggingface.co, https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  - scikit-learn (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
  - PyTorch (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  - spaCy (https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  - Lightning AI (https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- Open research communities and reading groups (mentor-like feedback via meetings and code review):
  - ML Collective Open Collab (weekly, remote: https://mlcollective.org)
  - EleutherAI (open research Discord: https://www.eleuther.ai)
  - LAION (open research: https://laion.ai)
  - OpenMined (privacy/FL: https://www.openmined.org)
  - fast.ai forums + study groups (https://forums.fast.ai)
- Entry programs and sprints (structured mentorship/co-mentorship):
  - Google Summer of Code (if eligible) with ML orgs (https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)
  - Outreachy (remote, paid, open source: https://www.outreachy.org)
  - NumFOCUS mentored sprints (https://numfocus.org/programs)
- Reproducibility and replication as an on-ramp:
  - ML Reproducibility Challenge (Papers with Code; periodic rounds: https://paperswithcode.com/rc)

How to start contributing (low-risk, high-signal steps)
- Start with non-intrusive PRs: fix docs, add examples, improve README, add tests for edge cases, or reproduce a reported bug with a minimal script. This is a proven way to get high-quality feedback and mentorship-like review from maintainers [Wilson et al., 2017; The Turing Way].
- Tackle “good first issue”/“help wanted” labels to learn the project’s standards and review cycle (GitHub’s “How to Contribute” guide is a useful primer).
- Join a study/reading group; volunteer to present a short 15–20 min summary of a paper and reproduce one result. You’ll get visibility and feedback without needing a prior network.

Suggested 90-day remote roadmap
- Weeks 1–2:
  - Pick a narrow sub-area (e.g., evaluation tooling for LLMs, data cleaning for vision, retrieval augmentation).
  - Join 2 communities from the list; introduce yourself with a concrete mini-goal.
  - Make 1–2 documentation or test PRs to an active repo.
- Weeks 3–4:
  - Replicate a small, recent result (e.g., a baseline model on a standard dataset). Share a public repo with:
    - exact environment (requirements.txt or environment.yml),
    - run scripts + seed settings,
    - a short report noting any replication gaps.
- Weeks 5–8:
  - Ship 2–3 code PRs (at least one non-trivial) aligned with your niche (e.g., add a missing metric, a dataset loader, or an evaluation harness).
  - Host a 1-hour paper reading session (announce in community Discord/forum; record notes).
- Weeks 9–12:
  - Propose a small scoped project (2–4 weeks) in the community: an evaluation benchmark, a data audit, or a reproducibility study. Ask for a maintainer sponsor/reviewer and set weekly check-ins.

Cold outreach that works (template)
- Subject: Tiny contribution + question on <project/module>
- Hi <Name>, I’ve been exploring <project>. I:
  - reproduced <small result> (link to repo/colab),
  - opened/plan to open PR <#> to add <tiny feature/fix>.
- I’d value a 15-minute chat or 2–3 lines of async feedback on whether <proposed next step> aligns with your roadmap. If not, happy to pivot to <backup small task>.
- Thanks, <Name> (<1-line background + time zone)
This works because it shows alignment, initiative, and a small, credible ask rather than “general mentorship.” See GitHub’s Open Source Guide for effective contribution etiquette.

How to run or join a remote reading/repro group
- Format: weekly 60 min on a shared doc (agenda + action items), rotating presenter, with a tiny “hands-on” each week (e.g., reproduce one table/figure).
- Tools: GitHub Project board for tasks, shared google doc/Notion for notes, lightweight code review via PRs.
- Make outputs public (notes + code). This compounds visibility and invites senior contributors to drop in.

Picking beginner-friendly, impact-aligned scopes
- High leverage, low compute:
  - Evaluation: implement missing metric, add robust evaluation scripts, or create small adversarial tests.
  - Data: create a cleaned subset, improve metadata, write a data card, or test data leakage.
  - Reproducibility: seed control, environment capture, results variance analysis; package a cookiecutter template for others to reuse.
- Avoid: vague “train a new SOTA model” or compute-heavy projects without mentorship.

Sustaining remote collaboration
- Maintain a weekly progress doc, timebox tasks to 1–2 weeks, and use issues with clear acceptance criteria.
- Adopt basic hygiene: version control, code review, tests, and environment capture [Wilson et al., 2017; The Turing Way]. These practices attract mentors because they reduce their review burden.

Concrete, falsifiable “starter” experiments you can run remotely
1) Reproducibility variance audit
- Hypothesis: The reported metric for <paper/model> on <dataset> varies by more than X% across seeds and minor environment changes.
- Variables: seed, CUDA/cuDNN version, batch size; Constants: model code and data split.
- Metrics: mean ± sd of primary metric; effect of each variable via ANOVA.
- Expected outcome: A quantified variance report and a minimal script to reproduce.
2) Evaluation robustness patch
- Hypothesis: Adding <new metric or stricter evaluation> changes model ranking on <benchmark>.
- Variables: metric choice; Constants: models and datasets.
- Metrics: rank correlation (Spearman), mean difference; significance test via permutation.
- Expected outcome: Evidence whether rankings are stable; PR adding the metric and documentation.
3) Data audit and leakage check
- Hypothesis: There is measurable leakage or label inconsistency in <dataset>, affecting baseline performance by >Y%.
- Variables: deduplication rule or split policy; Constants: model and training setup.
- Metrics: performance before/after mitigation; confidence intervals via bootstrap.
- Expected outcome: A short report and a PR with a safer split/dedup script.

Two literature anchors for best practices
- Wilson et al., 2017. “Good enough practices in scientific computing” (PLOS Comput Biol). Emphasizes version control, code review, testing, and small, reviewable changes that are ideal for remote collaboration (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).
- The Turing Way Community et al., “The Turing Way: A handbook for reproducible, ethical, and collaborative data science.” Practical guidance on reproducible workflows, collaboration, and running open projects (https://the-turing-way.netlify.app).

If you share your subfield (e.g., NLP evaluation, multimodal data, privacy/FL), I can point you to 2–3 specific repos and “good first issues” to try this week.
