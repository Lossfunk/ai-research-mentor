I'll be direct: **2 hours per week is extremely limited for making meaningful research contributions to AI safety**, but there are still valuable ways to engage. Let me outline realistic options and set proper expectations.

## Reality check

- **Research takes time**: Reading papers, running experiments, writing up results typically requires 10-20+ hours/week minimum
- **AI safety is competitive**: Many researchers work full-time; part-time contributors need strategic focus
- **Depth vs. breadth tradeoff**: With 2 hours/week, you'll progress slowly but can still build expertise over time

**That said**, here's how to maximize your limited time:

## Option 1: Structured learning (building toward future contributions)

**Goal**: Build foundational knowledge so you can contribute more substantially later (when you have more time).

**Approach** (2 hours/week = ~100 hours/year):
- **Months 1-3**: Work through [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/) curriculum (~2-3 hours/week with readings)
- **Months 4-6**: Read key AI safety papers systematically
  - Start with [Richard Ngo's AGI safety reading list](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HhWhaSzQr6xmBki8F/my-agi-threat-model-misaligned-model-organisms)
  - Or [80,000 Hours AI safety syllabus](https://80000hours.org/articles/ai-safety-syllabus/)
- **Months 7-12**: Engage deeply with one subfield (alignment, interpretability, robustness, governance)

**Output**: You won't publish research, but you'll be prepared to contribute when circumstances change.

## Option 2: Micro-contributions to existing projects

**Goal**: Make small, well-scoped contributions to ongoing research.

**Realistic activities** (2 hours/week):

1. **Contribute to open-source AI safety tools**
   - [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) (interpretability library)
   - [Anthropic's model evaluations](https://github.com/anthropics)
   - Documentation, bug fixes, small feature additions
   - **Time**: 1-2 hours/week, asynchronous

2. **Participate in distillation/writing**
   - Write explainers of AI safety papers for [Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)
   - Contribute to [AI Alignment Newsletter](https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/)
   - **Time**: One post every 2-4 weeks

3. **Data labeling or evaluation tasks**
   - Some research groups need human feedback for RLHF or red-teaming
   - Check [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/careers), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/careers), or academic labs for volunteer opportunities
   - **Time**: 2 hours/week, often flexible

4. **Replicate small experiments**
   - Pick a published AI safety paper with code
   - Verify results, test edge cases, document findings
   - Share on Alignment Forum or GitHub
   - **Time**: 2-3 months for one replication at 2 hours/week

## Option 3: Strategic focus on one narrow question

**Goal**: Make a tiny but real research contribution by going deep on one specific question.

**Approach**:
- Pick an extremely narrow, well-defined question in AI safety
- Spend 6-12 months on it at 2 hours/week
- Aim for a short write-up or Alignment Forum post, not a full paper

**Example micro-research questions**:
- "Do current LLMs exhibit consistent behavior under paraphrased safety prompts?" (empirical evaluation)
- "What's the relationship between model size and jailbreak success rates?" (data analysis)
- "Can we detect deceptive alignment in toy models?" (small-scale experiments)

**Realistic output**: A blog post, Alignment Forum post, or contribution to someone else's paper (not first-author publication).

## Option 4: Non-research contributions

If research isn't feasible, consider high-impact non-research roles:

1. **Community building** (2 hours/week)
   - Organize local AI safety reading groups
   - Moderate forums, connect researchers
   - [EA Groups](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved) or [AI Safety Support](https://www.aisafetysupport.org/)

2. **Funding/grantmaking** (if you have capital)
   - Small grants to AI safety researchers
   - Participate in [EA Funds](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/) or [Manifund](https://manifund.org/)

3. **Policy/governance** (if you have relevant expertise)
   - Comment on AI policy proposals
   - Contribute to [GovAI](https://www.governance.ai/) or similar initiatives

## My honest recommendation

Given your constraint, I'd suggest:

**Year 1**: **Option 1** (learning) + **Option 2** (micro-contributions)
- Spend 1.5 hours/week on AGI Safety Fundamentals or reading
- Spend 0.5 hours/week engaging with the community (Alignment Forum, Discord, etc.)
- Make one small open-source contribution every 2-3 months

**Year 2+**: Reassess based on:
- Has your time availability changed?
- Have you identified a specific niche where 2 hours/week could be impactful?
- Are there collaborators who could amplify your limited time?

## Setting expectations

**What 2 hours/week CAN achieve**:
- Build solid foundational knowledge over 1-2 years
- Make small, appreciated contributions to existing projects
- Stay connected to the AI safety community
- Position yourself to ramp up if time frees up

**What it CANNOT achieve**:
- First-author publications in top venues
- Leading a research agenda
- Keeping up with the cutting edge across multiple areas
- Running substantial experiments (training models, large-scale evaluations)

## Concrete first steps (this week)

1. **Sign up for [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/)** (next cohort) or start self-study
2. **Join [AI Alignment Slack](https://www.alignment.dev/)** or [EleutherAI Discord](https://www.eleuther.ai/) to find collaborators
3. **Read one key paper**: Start with [Concrete Problems in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565) (Amodei et al., 2016)
4. **Browse [Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)** for 30 minutes to see what people are working on

**Questions for you**:
- Is this a permanent constraint (2 hours/week indefinitely) or temporary?
- Do you have specific expertise (ML, philosophy, security, policy) that might guide your focus?
- Are you hoping to eventually transition to AI safety full-time, or is this a long-term side interest?

Your answers will help me give more targeted advice on where those 2 hours will have the most impact.
