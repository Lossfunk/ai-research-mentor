I can help you get started with AI research! To give you the most useful guidance, let me ask a few clarifying questions:

1. **Background**: What's your current level of education and experience with AI/ML? (e.g., undergraduate student, graduate student, self-taught programmer, transitioning from another field)

2. **Interests**: Are there particular areas of AI that excite you? For example:
   - Computer vision (image/video understanding)
   - Natural language processing (language models, chatbots)
   - Reinforcement learning (agents, robotics, games)
   - Theoretical ML (optimization, learning theory)
   - AI applications in specific domains (healthcare, climate, education, etc.)

3. **Goals**: What are you hoping to achieve?
   - Publish papers and pursue academia?
   - Build practical skills for industry research?
   - Explore AI as a hobby or side interest?

4. **Resources**: Do you have access to:
   - Computing resources (GPU access, cloud credits)?
   - Academic mentorship or a research group?
   - Time commitment (hours per week)?

**In the meantime, here's a general roadmap:**

**Foundations** (if needed):
- **Math**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability/statistics
- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch or TensorFlow
- **Core ML**: Take a course like Stanford's CS229, fast.ai, or Coursera's ML specialization

**Getting hands-on**:
- Replicate existing papers on small datasets
- Participate in Kaggle competitions or similar challenges
- Contribute to open-source ML projects

**Finding research directions**:
- Read survey papers in areas that interest you
- Follow recent conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ACL)
- Look for open problems in areas you care about

Once you share more about your situation, I can provide more targeted advice on specific topics, papers to read, or concrete next steps!
