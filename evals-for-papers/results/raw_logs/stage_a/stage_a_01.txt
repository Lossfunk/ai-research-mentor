Great! Before I give you tailored advice, I need to understand your situation better. Let me ask a few essential questions:

## Context Questions

1. **Resources & Time**: What's your current situation—are you a student, working professionally, self-studying? How many hours per week can you dedicate to AI research? Do you have access to compute (GPUs, cloud credits)?

2. **Background**: What's your technical background? (e.g., programming experience, math/stats knowledge, ML coursework or projects you've done)

3. **Interests**: What aspects of AI excite you most? (e.g., understanding how models work, building applications, theoretical foundations, specific domains like vision/language/robotics, AI safety)

4. **Support & Collaboration**: Do you have access to mentors, research groups, or collaborators? Or are you starting solo?

5. **Goals & Timeline**: What's your biggest goal right now—learn fundamentals, publish a paper, get into a PhD program, contribute to open problems? Any specific timeline or milestone?

## Immediate Guidance (While You Think)

**Intuition**: The best entry point into AI research isn't reading everything or picking the "perfect" problem—it's building hands-on experience with real systems while developing taste for what makes problems interesting [G3][G10]. Research skill comes from an explore-understand loop: you try things, notice surprises, and refine hypotheses [G5].

**Why this is principled**: Effective researchers focus on tractable, important problems where they can get feedback quickly [G1][G15]. Starting with reproduction of existing work or small extensions lets you build intuition about what works, develop research taste through concrete examples [G19], and avoid "seductive but low-impact" projects that look impressive but teach you little [G1].

### Three Concrete Starting Paths (pick based on your answers above):

**Path A – Reproduction-First (Best for building fundamentals)**
- Pick a recent paper (last 1-2 years) in an area you find interesting
- Reproduce one key result or figure from scratch
- Document what worked, what didn't, and one thing that surprised you
- *Why*: Gives you real signal about research quality, builds debugging skills, and often reveals new questions [G2][G5]

**Path B – Tutorial + Extension (Best for learning while contributing)**
- Work through a high-quality tutorial (e.g., Neel Nanda's mech interp guide [G7], or a domain-specific walkthrough)
- Identify one small unexplored variation or question
- Run a crisp 1-week experiment to test it
- *Why*: Structured learning with a clear path to original contribution [G15]

**Path C – Problem-Driven (Best if you have a specific curiosity)**
- Start with a concrete question you're genuinely curious about
- Spend 3 days reading what's known (not everything, just enough to orient)
- Design the simplest possible experiment to test one hypothesis
- *Why*: Intrinsic motivation sustains research through difficulties; personal fit matters [G12]

Once you answer the questions above, I'll give you specific next steps, paper recommendations, and a 2-week starter plan tailored to your situation.
