Great—here’s a practical, low-friction way to start AI research that builds skill, confidence, and evidence you can publish.

Where to start (choose one tractable niche)
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for LLMs with LoRA: Lets you get meaningful results on a single GPU by training a small number of parameters while keeping the base model frozen [P1]. See practice-focused guidance for LoRA hyperparameters and pitfalls [P7]. 
- Data-centric ML: Study how data quality, augmentation, and labeling choices affect performance and robustness; this is a high-leverage, under-explored space in many applied settings [P10].
- Rigor and reproducibility as a first-class goal: Follow reporting checklists and transparent methodology from the start to produce trustworthy results, even on small projects [P3][P4]. If you work with LLMs in applied domains, see empirical study design guidance emphasizing transparency and reproducibility [P2].

A simple 6-week starter plan
- Week 1: Pick a narrow question + dataset + baseline. Set up a reproducible repo: pinned versions, config files, seeds, exact data splits, and an experiment tracker (e.g., wandb/MLflow) [P3][P4][P9].
- Week 2: Reproduce a baseline exactly. Write down an analysis plan (metrics, statistical tests), pre-define ablations, and define pass/fail thresholds for your hypotheses [P3][P4][P9].
- Weeks 3–4: Run controlled ablations (change one factor at a time), use multiple seeds, and log all configs and random states [P3]. For LLMs, follow domain-specific empirical guidance where available [P2].
- Week 5: Analyze results with confidence intervals or nonparametric tests; report effect sizes and variance across seeds [P3][P9].
- Week 6: Write a short report with a reproducibility checklist and a one-click script to reproduce main/ablations results [P4][P9].

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments
1) LoRA hyperparameter sensitivity on a small instruction-tuning task
- Hypothesis: Increasing LoRA rank r improves instruction-following accuracy up to a mid-range (e.g., r=16) after which gains plateau; alpha has a smaller effect when scaled with r.
- Setup: Base model (e.g., open 1–3B parameter model), small instruction dataset (2–10k examples), LoRA with r ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32}, alpha ∈ {8, 16, 32}, single GPU, 3 seeds.
- Metrics: Exact match on held-out instructions, BLEU/ROUGE for generation, and calibration (ECE).
- Controls: Same tokenizer, same train/val split, same optimizer/scheduler, early stopping based on validation.
- Expected outcome: Diminishing returns beyond moderate ranks; clear seed variability reported with CIs [P1][P7].

2) Data quality vs. quantity in image classification (data-centric baseline)
- Hypothesis: At fixed compute, improving label cleanliness (reducing injected noise) yields larger accuracy gains than adding 20% more noisy data; basic augmentation helps but cannot fully offset label noise.
- Setup: CIFAR-10 or similar; create training sets with 0%, 10%, 20% symmetric label noise; train a small ResNet under identical training budgets; with/without a simple augmentation policy (e.g., flips/crops kept constant across trials), 5 seeds.
- Metrics: Top-1 accuracy, calibration (ECE), and robustness to distribution shift (e.g., CIFAR-10-C corruption subset).
- Expected outcome: Clean labels dominate modest data increases; report full factorial results with uncertainty [P10].

3) Reproducibility stress test for a basic supervised baseline
- Hypothesis: Reported single-number gains of ≤1 percentage point vanish when evaluated across seeds and stratified splits; the variance across seeds is comparable to or larger than the claimed improvement.
- Setup: Choose a published baseline (e.g., small vision or text classifier); replicate it exactly; run 10 seeds; evaluate on multiple, pre-registered data folds.
- Metrics: Mean ± 95% CI for accuracy/F1; paired tests across seeds/folds; effect size (Cohen’s d).
- Expected outcome: If the improvement is real, it remains significant after accounting for variance; if not, you’ll quantify instability and provide stronger reporting per REFORMS [P3][P4].

Working style and checklists
- Make your repo reproducible from day one: environment.yml/requirements.txt, pinned versions, scripts for data download/splitting, and a run.sh that reproduces the main table [P4][P9].
- Predefine ablations and controls; change one factor at a time; log all configs; use multiple seeds; report uncertainty and effect sizes [P3][P9].
- If working with LLMs in applied studies (e.g., code, SE tasks), follow domain-specific empirical guidance to avoid common pitfalls and ensure transparent reporting [P2].
- Document ethical and responsible model development choices (data provenance, known limitations, appropriate use) [P6].

What to read next (short list)
- Survey and practice for LoRA/PEFT to pick sensible hyperparameters and tasks [P1][P7].
- REFORMS reporting standards and the open-repro handbook to structure your workflow and paper from the start [P3][P4][P9].
- Data-centric ML overview to inspire impactful, compute-efficient projects focused on data rather than model scale [P10].

If you share your background (e.g., vision/NLP, access to GPUs, coding comfort), I can help tailor one of the experiments above into a concrete project plan with dataset, baseline code, and an evaluation table template.
