Great—you can get started in AI research without boiling the ocean. Here’s a pragmatic, evidence-based path with concrete experiments you can run this month.

Step 1 — Build just-enough foundations (2–6 weeks)
- Programming/math: Get comfortable with Python, NumPy/pandas, and basic statistics/linear algebra; early wins come from small projects while you learn, not after you “finish” the theory [P1][P2][P3].
- Survey subfields: Sample beginner-friendly courses and short projects in vision (CIFAR-10), NLP (SST-2/AG News), or tabular ML (UCI datasets) to choose a lane [P4].
- Deliverable: Pick one subfield and one public dataset you can train on a laptop or a free GPU (e.g., Colab).

Step 2 — Adopt a replication-first workflow (week 3+)
- Start by replicating a simple but standard baseline on your chosen dataset (e.g., ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, DistilBERT on SST-2). This de-risks tooling and clarifies evaluation [P10].
- Write a brief preregistration: hypotheses, metrics, stopping criteria, and the exact comparisons you’ll make; this helps you avoid p-hacking and keeps results interpretable [P6][P10].
- Deliverable: A minimal, fully reproducible baseline run (seeded training, pinned package versions, saved configs).

Step 3 — Be rigorous about evaluation and reporting
- Use strong baselines, run ablations, and report uncertainty (multiple seeds or bootstrap CIs). Follow established checklists for transparency and comparability [P7][P10].
- Track experiments, versions, and compute; keep a changelog and a short README so others can reproduce your results [P9].
- Document data and models (data/model cards) to surface limitations and risks early [P8].

Three concrete, falsifiable starter experiments
Each is scoped to 1 GPU or CPU-only training, with clear hypotheses, variables, and metrics.

1) Vision: Generalization via data augmentation on CIFAR-10
- Hypothesis: Moderate augmentations (flip/crop/cutout) improve out-of-distribution generalization and calibration, not just in-distribution accuracy.
- Setup: CIFAR-10; model: ResNet-18; optimizer: SGD with momentum.
- Variables: Augmentations: none vs. RandomCrop+Flip vs. +Cutout. Control regularization (weight decay) across conditions.
- Metrics: Test accuracy; Expected Calibration Error (ECE); confidence-accuracy calibration curve. 3–5 seeds with mean ± 95% CI.
- Expected outcome: Augmentation improves accuracy and reduces ECE relative to no augmentation; cutout may yield diminishing returns if weight decay is strong [P10].
- Notes: Pre-register the primary metric (accuracy) and secondary (ECE) and stop criteria [P6][P10].

2) NLP: Parameter-efficient tuning vs. full fine-tuning on SST-2
- Hypothesis: LoRA adapters achieve statistically indistinguishable accuracy to full fine-tuning of DistilBERT on SST-2 with fewer trainable parameters.
- Setup: DistilBERT; dataset: SST-2; training budget ≤ 1 hour on a single T4.
- Variables: Adapter config (LoRA rank 8 vs. 32) vs. full fine-tune; same epochs, batch size, and learning rate sweep grid applied uniformly.
- Metrics: Dev/test accuracy; training time; number of trainable parameters; 3–5 seeds with mean ± CI.
- Expected outcome: LoRA r=8 within ~1–2% absolute accuracy of full fine-tune; lower wall-clock and trainable params [P10].
- Reporting: Include a small reproducibility checklist (seed control, exact tokenizer/model versions, data splits) [P7][P9].

3) Tabular: Do gradient-boosted trees beat shallow neural nets on UCI Adult?
- Hypothesis: XGBoost or LightGBM outperforms a shallow MLP on AUROC with less tuning on structured tabular data.
- Setup: UCI Adult; strong categorical handling for trees; simple MLP baseline with batch norm and dropout.
- Variables: Model class (GBDT vs. MLP); hyperparameter sweep matched by budget (e.g., 30 trials each).
- Metrics: AUROC (primary), AUPRC; calibration (Brier score); fairness diagnostics (demographic parity difference) on sensitive attribute if available.
- Expected outcome: GBDT > MLP on AUROC; MLP may calibrate worse without temperature scaling [P10].
- Reporting: Show confidence intervals and exact split strategy; document data preprocessing in a data card [P8][P9].

How to choose your subfield and first paper
- If you enjoy code+math: start with vision or classical ML; if you enjoy language and evaluation design, start with NLP; if you like applied science/industry data, start with tabular ML. Sample small projects in each, then commit to one for 4–6 weeks [P1][P2][P4].
- Anchor your first project on a known benchmark and a reputable, reproducible baseline; use a checklist like REFORMS to ensure fair comparisons and clear reporting [P7][P10].

Minimal habits that compound quickly
- Always define hypotheses, primary/secondary metrics, and stopping rules before running long jobs [P6][P10].
- Compare against strong, public baselines; include ablations that isolate your contribution [P7][P10].
- Make your repo runnable end-to-end with one command; pin versions and log seeds [P9].
- Add short data/model cards noting assumptions and limitations [P8].

If you share a bit about your interests (vision, NLP, LLMs, RL, or applied ML), I’ll tailor the first replication target and dataset to your constraints.
