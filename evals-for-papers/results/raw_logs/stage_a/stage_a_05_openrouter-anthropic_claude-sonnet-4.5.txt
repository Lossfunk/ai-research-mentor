**One month is extremely tight for a thesis!** Let me help you pick something feasible and get you moving immediately.

## Critical questions first

1. **What type of thesis?**
   - Undergraduate/Master's project?
   - What's the expected length and scope? (e.g., 20 pages vs. 100 pages)
   - Does it need original research, or can it be a literature review/replication study?

2. **Your background?**
   - Have you taken ML courses? Implemented neural networks?
   - Programming skills (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow)?
   - Any prior AI projects?

3. **Resources available?**
   - GPU access (university cluster, cloud credits, personal)?
   - Can you work full-time on this, or do you have other commitments?
   - Is your advisor available for guidance?

4. **Deliverables?**
   - Just a written thesis, or also code/experiments/presentation?
   - Are there specific requirements (novelty, experiments, etc.)?

## Emergency strategy (assuming worst case: original work needed, limited ML background)

If you need to start **TODAY** and finish in 4 weeks, here's the playbook:

### **Week 1: Pick topic + get baseline running**
### **Week 2: Run experiments**
### **Week 3: Analyze results + start writing**
### **Week 4: Finish writing + polish**

---

## Safe thesis topics (doable in 1 month)

These are **low-risk, high-feasibility** options:

### **Option A: Comparative study / Benchmark analysis**
**Idea**: Compare existing methods on a well-defined task.

**Examples**:
- "Comparing transformer architectures for text classification" (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT on IMDB/AG News)
- "Evaluating few-shot learning methods on image classification" (test 3-4 methods on mini-ImageNet)
- "Robustness of LLMs to prompt variations" (test GPT/Claude on paraphrased prompts)

**Why safe**:
- No novel method needed—just rigorous comparison
- Datasets and code already exist
- Clear structure: intro → methods → experiments → results → discussion

**Time breakdown**:
- Days 1-3: Literature review, pick 2-3 methods and 1-2 datasets
- Days 4-7: Get baseline code running
- Days 8-14: Run experiments, collect results
- Days 15-21: Analyze, make plots
- Days 22-30: Write thesis

---

### **Option B: Replication + extension**
**Idea**: Replicate a recent paper and add one small twist.

**Examples**:
- Replicate a paper from a recent workshop (NeurIPS, ICML), test on a new dataset
- Take an existing method, apply it to a different domain (e.g., sentiment analysis → hate speech detection)
- Reproduce results and investigate one failure case or limitation

**Why safe**:
- Original paper provides roadmap
- Code often available (GitHub)
- "Extension" can be minimal (new dataset, ablation study, error analysis)

**How to find papers**:
- Browse recent [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) workshops
- Look for papers with code: [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
- Pick something from last 1-2 years (more likely to have good code)

**Time breakdown**:
- Days 1-2: Pick paper, read thoroughly
- Days 3-5: Get their code running
- Days 6-10: Replicate main results
- Days 11-17: Run your extension experiments
- Days 18-30: Write thesis

---

### **Option C: Application project (if you have domain knowledge)**
**Idea**: Apply existing ML to a specific problem you understand.

**Examples**:
- "Predicting student performance using ML" (if you have education data)
- "Detecting fake reviews with transformers" (use public Amazon/Yelp datasets)
- "Forecasting energy consumption with LSTMs" (public energy datasets)

**Why safe**:
- Leverages your domain expertise
- Practical, easy to motivate
- Standard ML pipeline: data → model → evaluation

**Time breakdown**:
- Days 1-3: Find dataset, exploratory data analysis
- Days 4-7: Baseline model (logistic regression, simple NN)
- Days 8-14: Implement 2-3 ML methods
- Days 15-21: Compare results, error analysis
- Days 22-30: Write thesis

---

### **Option D: Literature review / Survey (if allowed)**
**Idea**: Comprehensive review of a specific AI subfield.

**Examples**:
- "Survey of prompt engineering techniques for LLMs"
- "Review of explainability methods for deep learning"
- "Fairness in computer vision: methods and challenges"

**Why safe**:
- No experiments needed
- Demonstrates understanding of field
- Easier to scope and finish on time

**Requirements**:
- Read 30-50 papers
- Organize into taxonomy/framework
- Identify trends, gaps, future directions

**Time breakdown**:
- Days 1-5: Collect papers, skim all, read 10-15 deeply
- Days 6-15: Read remaining papers, take notes, organize themes
- Days 16-25: Write survey sections
- Days 26-30: Polish, add figures/tables

**Check with your advisor**: Some programs don't accept pure literature reviews for theses.

## My recommendation for you (default choice)

**If you have basic ML skills**: Go with **Option A** (comparative study).

**Specific suggestion**: 
**"Comparing Pre-trained Language Models for [Pick One: Sentiment Analysis / Text Classification / Question Answering]"**

**Why this works**:
- Datasets readily available (IMDB, SST-2, SQuAD, etc.)
- Pre-trained models accessible via Hugging Face
- Code examples abundant
- Results in 1-2 days of GPU time
- Clear contribution: "Which model works best for X task under Y constraints?"

**Concrete plan** (30 days):
1. **Day 1**: Pick task (e.g., sentiment analysis) and dataset (e.g., IMDB)
2. **Day 2-3**: Literature review (read 5-10 papers on sentiment analysis + transformers)
3. **Day 4-5**: Set up environment, download data, get Hugging Face working
4. **Day 6-7**: Fine-tune BERT on your dataset (baseline)
5. **Day 8-10**: Fine-tune 2-3 other models (RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT)
6. **Day 11-14**: Run experiments (vary hyperparameters, test on different splits)
7. **Day 15-17**: Analyze results (accuracy, speed, model size tradeoffs)
8. **Day 18-20**: Error analysis (what do models get wrong? why?)
9. **Day 21-25**: Write thesis (intro, related work, methods, results, discussion)
10. **Day 26-28**: Make plots, tables, polish writing
11. **Day 29-30**: Proofread, format, submit

## Immediate action items (TODAY)

1. **Clarify requirements** with your professor:
   - Minimum page count?
   - Must it be original research?
   - Any specific topics they want you to avoid/pursue?

2. **Assess your skills honestly**:
   - Can you code a neural network in PyTorch/TensorFlow right now?
   - If no → pick Option D (survey) or find a project with complete code

3. **Secure compute resources**:
   - Do you have GPU access? If not, sign up for [Google Colab Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/) ($10/month) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (free GPUs)

4. **Pick your topic by end of today**:
   - Use decision framework: What can you finish in 3 weeks with your current skills?

5. **Start tomorrow**:
   - Day 1 should be: literature search + dataset download + environment setup

## Red flags to avoid

❌ **Don't pick**: "I'll train a large language model from scratch" (impossible in 1 month)  
❌ **Don't pick**: "I'll invent a new architecture" (too risky, likely won't work)  
❌ **Don't pick**: Topics requiring data collection (surveys, web scraping—too slow)  
❌ **Don't pick**: Anything requiring specialized hardware (robotics, edge devices)  
❌ **Don't pick**: Topics with no existing code/datasets (you'll spend all month on infrastructure)

✅ **Do pick**: Well-trodden paths with existing code, datasets, and clear evaluation metrics

**Tell me**:
1. What's your ML background (courses taken, projects done)?
2. What type of thesis is this (undergrad/master's/other)?
3. Does it need to be original research or can it be a replication/survey?
4. Do you have GPU access?

With those answers, I can give you a **specific, day-by-day plan** to finish on time!
