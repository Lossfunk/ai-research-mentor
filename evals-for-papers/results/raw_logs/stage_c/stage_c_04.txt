# Turnkey Research Execution Plan: Meaningful Research with Zero Compute

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Core Problem**: Conducting impactful research without computational resources by leveraging theoretical analysis, mathematical frameworks, and systematic literature synthesis.

**Primary Goals**:
- Develop theoretical contributions through mathematical analysis and proof-based work [P3]
- Create comprehensive survey papers that synthesize existing knowledge
- Propose novel theoretical frameworks or algorithmic improvements
- Conduct meta-analyses of existing experimental results
- Design theoretical models that can be validated by others with compute resources

**Success Metrics**: Publications in theory-focused venues, citations from computational researchers, adoption of theoretical frameworks by practitioners.

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Theoretical Complexity Analysis
**Hypothesis**: Existing algorithms in [chosen domain] have suboptimal theoretical bounds that can be improved through novel mathematical analysis.
**Setup**: Literature review + mathematical proof development using pen, paper, and symbolic computation tools (free: Sage, Maxima)
**Baselines**: Current best-known theoretical bounds in the literature
**Evaluation Metrics**: Asymptotic improvement factors, proof correctness verification through peer review
**Expected Outcomes**: Tighter complexity bounds or novel algorithmic insights

### Experiment 2: Systematic Literature Meta-Analysis
**Hypothesis**: Aggregating results across multiple computational studies will reveal patterns invisible in individual papers.
**Setup**: Systematic collection of experimental results from 50+ papers, statistical analysis using R/Python (free tier cloud notebooks)
**Baselines**: Individual study conclusions vs. aggregated findings
**Evaluation Metrics**: Effect sizes, confidence intervals, heterogeneity measures
**Expected Outcomes**: Meta-analytical insights that guide future experimental work

### Experiment 3: Theoretical Framework Development
**Hypothesis**: A new mathematical framework can unify disparate approaches in [chosen area] and predict performance characteristics.
**Setup**: Mathematical modeling, proof development, framework validation against existing results
**Baselines**: Existing theoretical frameworks' explanatory power
**Evaluation Metrics**: Framework generality, predictive accuracy on known results, mathematical elegance
**Expected Outcomes**: Novel theoretical contribution that others can implement and test

## 3. Timeline for Next 6 Months

**Month 1**: Domain selection and comprehensive literature review (200+ papers)
**Month 2**: Identify theoretical gaps and formulate specific research questions
**Month 3**: Develop mathematical frameworks and begin proof work for Experiment 1
**Month 4**: Complete theoretical analysis, begin systematic data collection for meta-analysis
**Month 5**: Finalize meta-analysis, develop novel theoretical framework (Experiment 3)
**Month 6**: Write papers, seek feedback, submit to theory-focused venues

## 4. Resources

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Limited validation of theoretical work | High | Medium | Partner with computational researchers for validation |
| Difficulty accessing paywalled papers | Medium | High | Use university library access, preprint servers, author requests |
| Theoretical contributions deemed incremental | Medium | High | Focus on fundamental questions, seek early feedback |
| Isolation from research community | High | Medium | Active participation in virtual conferences, online forums |
| Mathematical errors in proofs | Medium | High | Seek multiple peer reviews, use proof assistants when possible |

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-up Directions

**Immediate Extensions**:
- Develop open-source theoretical analysis tools for the community
- Create educational content explaining theoretical insights
- Organize virtual workshops on zero-compute research methods

**Long-term Directions**:
