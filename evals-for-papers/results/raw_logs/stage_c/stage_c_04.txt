1. Problem framing and goals
- Framing: With no local compute, focus on research that leverages:
  - Evaluation via existing model APIs (compute runs on provider side) and public benchmarks.
  - Data-centric audits (documentation completeness, label quality, dataset artifacts).
  - Reproducible, low-cost measurement studies and reporting standards.
- Why this matters: Data-centric improvements and comprehensive evaluation can drive substantive progress without training new models, especially in the LLM era [P2]. Clear reporting and standards strengthen reproducibility and external validity [P3]. Behavioral testing and holistic evaluation frameworks already exist and can be applied using APIs [n][n].
- Concrete goals:
  1) Build an API-based, reproducible behavioral evaluation suite for LLMs across safety, robustness, and bias that reuses HELM scenarios and CheckList templates [n][n].
  2) Conduct a documentation audit of widely used datasets and models against Datasheets and Model Cards, and propose a rubric and compliance baseline [n][n][P3].
  3) Estimate and validate label noise in popular datasets via Confident Learning using zero-shot or API predictions, and quantify downstream effects [n].

2. Experiments
Experiment 1: API-only behavioral robustness of LLMs
- Hypothesis: Structured prompting and minimal guardrails (system instructions + refusal policies) reduce failure rates on behavioral tests without substantially harming task accuracy. This can be measured using CheckList capabilities and HELM scenarios [n][n].
- Setup:
  - Models: 3–5 widely used LLM APIs (e.g., major providers’ flagship and small models).
  - Tasks: Subset of HELM scenarios (question answering, summarization, reasoning) and CheckList capability tests (invariance, directional expectations, minimal pairs) [n][n].
  - Interventions: Baseline prompt; +system safety prompt; +structured task decomposition; +content policy reminders.
  - Sampling: 500–2,000 items total across tasks to stay within low budget.
- Baselines:
  - Default prompt (provider’s recommended basic instruction).
  - Provider’s safety-tuned model variant (if available).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Task performance: exact match/F1 where applicable, or rubric-based correctness using a held-out judge with deterministic rules for tasks that allow it; for open-ended tasks, limited human rating on a small subset.
  - Robustness: CheckList pass rate across perturbations [n].
  - Risk-aware metrics (error rates under worst-case slices inspired by HELM) [n].
- Expected outcomes:
  - Quantify robustness gaps between default vs structured prompting and across models.
  - Identify scenarios where safety prompting causes meaningful performance regressions (if any) and where it reduces harmful outputs [n].
  - A reproducible harness and release of prompts, outputs, and analysis.

Experiment 2: Measuring bias and toxicity trade-offs using public benchmarks
- Hypothesis: Stronger safety prompting reduces toxicity on RealToxicityPrompts and stereotype-leaning preferences on CrowS-Pairs/StereoSet with minimal degradation of helpfulness on benign prompts [n][n][n].
- Setup:
  - Datasets: RealToxicityPrompts (toxicity stress-test) [n], CrowS-Pairs (stereotypical bias minimal pairs) [n], StereoSet (intra/inter-sentence bias) [n].
  - Models: Same APIs as Exp. 1.
  - Prompt conditions: default vs safety-optimized system prompts; user identity disclaimers; refusal-first vs justify-and-redirect strategies.
- Baselines:
  - Default prompting; safety-tuned model variant (if available).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Toxicity: Perspective API probabilities and mean toxicity; fraction above thresholds [n].
  - Bias: CrowS-Pairs score (prefer anti-stereotype over stereotype completions) [n]; StereoSet language-model preference scores [n].
  - Helpfulness: Simple rubric-based correctness on benign prompts; small-sample human rating for content-preserving quality trade-offs.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Measure trade-offs between toxicity reduction and helpfulness.
  - Identify prompt patterns that consistently reduce toxicity and bias across models [n][n][n].

Experiment 3: Documentation audit for datasets and model releases
- Hypothesis: A sizable fraction of widely used datasets/models lack key documentation elements (provenance, curation, intended use, limitations), and a rubric-driven audit can quantify gaps and improve reporting practices [n][n][P3].
- Setup:
  - Sample: Top 50–100 datasets and top 30–50 models on Hugging Face by downloads.
  - Rubric: Binary/ordinal checks derived from Datasheets (dataset motivation/provenance/collection/annotation/ethical considerations/maintenance) and Model Cards (intended use, metrics, limitations, ethical considerations) [n][n].
  - Process: Two independent raters per item; adjudicate disagreements.
- Baselines:
  - None (establish first public baseline). Compare against any limited prior surveys if found; otherwise note as first comprehensive audit.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Coverage % per rubric field; inter-rater agreement (Cohen’s kappa); correlations between documentation completeness and downstream indicators (e.g., number of issues filed, reported harms).
- Expected outcomes:
  - A transparent baseline of documentation quality; a shareable rubric and codebook; recommendations mapped to REFORMS-style reporting needs [P3].

Experiment 4 (optional but low-cost): Label noise estimation via Confident Learning with API predictions
- Hypothesis: Confident Learning using zero-shot/API-generated label probabilities will detect non-trivial label errors in popular classification datasets, and cleaning a small identified subset improves measured accuracy using simple classifiers [n].
- Setup:
  - Datasets: Choose 2–3 mid-sized classification datasets (e.g., sentiment, topic classification).
  - Predictions: Obtain class probabilities via API zero-shot classification; run Confident Learning to flag likely mislabeled examples [n].
  - Validation: Manual re-annotation of a small subset (n=200–400) by 2–3 annotators to estimate precision of error flags.
  - Downstream: Evaluate a lightweight classifier using API embeddings (provider-side compute) on original vs cleaned labels.
- Baselines:
  - Original dataset labels; random sample of suspected errors as negative control.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Estimated label error rate; precision of error detection; change in accuracy/F1 before vs after cleaning; inter-annotator agreement.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Evidence of label quality issues and pragmatic cleaning protocols that require no training compute [n][P2].

3. Timeline for the next 6 months with milestones

- Budget:
  - Start with a pilot budget (e.g., $100–$300) and scale carefully; log token costs per run to maintain compute accounting.

5. Risks and mitigations
- Risk: API policy or model changes during study.
  - Mitigation: Pin model versions when possible; cache prompts/outputs; rerun small stability checks monthly.
- Risk: Measurement validity (toxicity/bias metrics may not fully capture harm).
  - Mitigation: Use multiple metrics (Perspective + human spot checks); report metric limitations explicitly [n].
- Risk: Small sample sizes limit statistical power.
  - Mitigation: Preregister power targets; focus on medium-to-large effect sizes; report CIs and sensitivity analyses [P3].
- Risk: Annotation bias in documentation audit and label verification.
  - Mitigation: Clear codebook; double-coding; compute inter-rater kappa; adjudication protocol [P3].
- Risk: Budget overruns from API calls.
  - Mitigation: Progressive sampling; early stopping if effects are clear; cost dashboards.
- Risk: Dataset licensing/ethical concerns.
  - Mitigation: Verify licenses; avoid personal data; follow dataset creators’ use policies; include ethics statement [P3].

6. Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Release a small, fully reproducible benchmark of behavioral tests and bias/toxicity prompts with scripts and documented costs; integrate into HELM-style reporting [n].
- Build a public documentation leaderboard for Model Cards/Datasheets completeness with recommendations and templates [n][n].
- Cross-lingual extensions: replicate Experiments 1–2 in 2–3 additional languages using translated CheckList templates.
- Explore data-centric mitigations: curating small, high-quality prompt sets that reduce failure rates; publish ablation on prompt design choices [P2].
- Meta-research: analyze correlations between documentation completeness and downstream incident reports or issue tracker flags [P3].
