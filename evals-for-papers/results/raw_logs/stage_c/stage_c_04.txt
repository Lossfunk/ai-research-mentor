1) Problem framing and goals
Focus: Make high-impact, compute-light contributions by advancing evaluation, reproducibility, and documentation practices for LLM/NLP systems using existing models via public inference APIs and human-centered methods. This leverages:
- Systematic synthesis (PRISMA) to map and assess practices without training models [1].
- Reproducibility checklists and artifact audits to quantify scientific rigor and what correlates with replicable results [2][3].
- Behavioral test design (e.g., CheckList) to uncover failures aggregate metrics miss, using small, carefully curated test suites and limited API calls [6].
- Transparent documentation (Datasheets, Model Cards) to improve model understanding and reduce misuse [4][5].

Primary goals (6 months):
- Deliver a PRISMA-compliant systematic review of current LLM evaluation practices and metric validity.
- Build and validate a small-scope behavioral test suite and red-teaming protocol that reveals failures beyond accuracy; share as an open resource.
- Conduct a limited-scope reproducibility audit of recent LLM papers (documentation, seeds, data, scripts) and analyze associations with result stability.
- Author two high-quality documentation exemplars (Datasheet + Model Card) for widely used open models, with a small user study on usefulness.

Methodology grounding: Prioritize clear questions, crisp experiments, and transparent reporting [G1][G10]; choose tractable, high-leverage problems over compute-heavy ones [G7]. Use PRISMA for reviews and the NeurIPS/JMLR reproducibility guidance for audits [1][2][3]. Use CheckList/Dynabench principles for behavioral test design [6][7]. Note: The unified research tool surfaced a broad review [P1] that mentions PRISMA and reproducibility but is off-target for LLM evaluation; we therefore cite primary sources directly [1–7].

2) Experiments
Experiment 1: Behavioral test suites catch failures missed by aggregate accuracy
- Hypothesis: Carefully designed CheckList-style tests expose previously unreported LLM failure modes (contrast sets, MFTs, perturbations) even when benchmark accuracy is high [6].
- Setup: 
  - Task scope: basic reasoning + instruction-following (e.g., negation handling, numeracy, safety disclaimers).
  - Build ~60 minimal test cases across 6 phenomena using CheckList-style templates. Use 2–3 public models via the Hugging Face free Inference API in small batches [10].
  - Limit calls via sampling 5–10 examples per phenomenon to stay within zero-compute constraints.
- Baselines: 
  - Model-level baseline: reported benchmark accuracy (e.g., a simple subset of a public task or your suite’s aggregate accuracy).
  - Human baseline on a 10–15 item subset (via small volunteer group).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Failure rates per phenomenon; delta vs. aggregate accuracy.
  - Robustness gap under minimal perturbations (e.g., paraphrase, distractor insertion).
  - Inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s kappa) on 20% of items.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Significant failure rates in at least 2 phenomena despite strong aggregate accuracy.
  - Perturbation-induced drops >10 percentage points on some targeted skills.
  - A compact, reusable test suite released publicly.
- Evidence: Behavioral testing reveals beyond-accuracy issues [6]; adversarial collection benefits evaluation [7].

Experiment 2: Reproducibility checklists correlate with stability of reported results
- Hypothesis: Papers satisfying key checklist items (data/code availability, seeds, hyperparameters, environment) show more stable results when lightly replicated or cross-verified [2][3].
- Setup:
  - Sample: 30–50 recent LLM evaluation papers from top venues.
  - Score each paper with a rubric derived from the NeurIPS checklist and Pineau et al. criteria [2][3][9].
  - Attempt “lite” replication: run an open model via API on a small subset (e.g., 20–30 items) approximating their evaluation to compute directionally consistent trends.
- Baselines:
  - Descriptive baseline: overall mean checklist score.
  - Compare high-score vs low-score papers on replication success (binary) and deviation magnitude.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Correlation between checklist score and replication success.
  - Median absolute deviation between reported and rechecked performance on a small subset.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Positive association between checklist adherence and reproducibility proxies.
  - Actionable guidance on which checklist items are most predictive of stability.
- Evidence: Formal checklists and reporting standards improve reproducibility [2][3][9].

Experiment 3: Model documentation improves practitioner understanding and intended-use alignment
- Hypothesis: Providing Model Cards and Datasheets improves practitioners’ decision quality and reduces misuse compared to standard README-style docs [4][5].
- Setup:
  - Select 2 open models with limited official documentation.
  - Author Model Card + Datasheet for each using the original frameworks [4][5].
  - User study: randomized between-subjects online study (n=30–40 practitioners) comparing standard README vs enhanced documentation; tasks include choosing a model for a use case and identifying risks.
- Baselines:
  - Control arm: standard README or brief model page.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Decision quality score (rubric-based), time to decision, risk identification count, and self-reported confidence.
- Expected outcomes:
  - Statistically significant improvements in risk identification and alignment with intended use in the treatment group.
- Evidence: Datasheets and Model Cards improve transparency and help reduce misuse [4][5].

Experiment 4 (optional): PRISMA review of LLM evaluation metrics for reasoning validity
- Hypothesis: Many evaluation metrics used for “reasoning” conflate surface accuracy with construct validity; a PRISMA review will reveal gaps and inconsistent operationalization [1].
- Setup:
  - Register a protocol, define inclusion/exclusion, search strings, and screening process per PRISMA 2020 [1].
  - Extract metric definitions, reported validity evidence, and failure analyses.
- Baselines:
  - None (systematic review).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Taxonomy coverage; fraction of papers providing validity arguments; inter-rater reliability for screening.
- Expected outcomes:
  - A taxonomy of reasoning metrics and identified validity gaps, informing Experiment 1’s design.
- Evidence: PRISMA provides rigorous, transparent review methodology [1].

Two literature anchors:

4) Resources (compute, tools, datasets)
- Compute: None required locally. Use:
  - Hugging Face Inference API free tier to query small-to-medium models with strict rate limits [10].
  - Spreadsheet/statistics tools (Google Sheets/R, Python locally for stats if possible; otherwise browser-based tools).
- Tools:
  - CheckList for behavioral test design [6].
  - Dynabench principles and Dynaboard for holistic evaluation framing [7].
  - NeurIPS Reproducibility Checklist and Pineau et al. as audit basis [2][3][9].
  - OSF or GitHub Pages for preregistration, artifact sharing, and transparency.
  - Survey tools (Google Forms) for user studies.
- Datasets/material:
  - Small, hand-authored test items (your test suite).
  - For light replications: subsets of public benchmarks (tiny slices) compatible with fair use; document sampling.
  - Paper corpus for audit (30–50 recent LLM evaluation papers).
- Documentation frameworks:
  - Datasheets for Datasets [4].
  - Model Cards for Model Reporting [5].

5) Risks and mitigations table
- Risk: API rate limits or model unavailability.
  - Mitigation: Predefine tiny batches; cache responses; diversify providers; schedule off-peak queries [10].
- Risk: Human annotation noise.
  - Mitigation: Clear instructions; training examples; dual annotation with adjudication; report inter-annotator agreement.
- Risk: IRB/ethics for user studies.
  - Mitigation: Use minimal-risk protocols; anonymize; obtain informed consent; consider institutional review or community ethics checklist.
- Risk: Low external validity of small test suite.
  - Mitigation: Cover diverse phenomena; release suite for community extensions; transparently report limits [6][7].
- Risk: Novelty overlap with existing evaluations.
  - Mitigation: PRISMA scoping to ensure gap; register protocol; focus on underexplored phenomena [1].
- Risk: Reproducibility audit subjectivity.
  - Mitigation: Use established checklists and double-coding; publish rubric and inter-rater reliability [2][3][9].
- Risk: Limited practitioner recruitment for user study.
  - Mitigation: Recruit via forums, student groups; compensate with recognition; reduce session time to 10–12 minutes.
- Risk: Legal/ethical issues around model outputs.
  - Mitigation: Filter sensitive content; document safety considerations in Model Cards; follow platform acceptable-use policies [5].

6) Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Public micro-benchmark hub: a website hosting your small-scope behavioral tests, with community submissions and leaderboards (evaluation-as-a-service ethos) [7].
- Cross-model documentation study: Compare how documentation quality varies across model providers; propose a minimal standard distilled from Model Cards + Datasheets [4][5].
- Construct validity audits: Formalize a rubric for assessing whether an evaluation actually measures the claimed construct (reasoning, alignment), and apply it to 100+ papers via crowd annotation (scalable, non-compute).
- Red-teaming playbooks: Release scenario-based templates for safely probing models’ safety and instruction-following failures with minimal tokens.

Optional next step
If helpful, I can draft the PRISMA protocol (research questions, search strings, inclusion/exclusion, screening flow) and the reproducibility audit rubric this week so you can start immediately.
