# Turnkey Research Execution Plan: Zero-Compute Meaningful Research

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Core Problem**: How to conduct impactful research without computational resources, leveraging theoretical analysis, surveys, and methodological contributions.

**Primary Goals**:
- Conduct comprehensive literature surveys that identify gaps and synthesize knowledge [P3]
- Develop theoretical frameworks and mathematical analyses
- Create methodological contributions through novel experimental designs
- Perform meta-analyses of existing work using publicly available results
- Design zero-shot evaluation protocols that don't require training [P1]

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Comprehensive Survey with Gap Analysis
**Hypothesis**: Systematic analysis of existing literature will reveal underexplored research directions and methodological gaps.
**Setup**: Systematic literature review using academic databases, focusing on recent 3-5 years of publications in target domain.
**Baselines**: Compare against existing surveys in the field to identify coverage gaps.
**Evaluation Metrics**: Number of papers analyzed, taxonomy completeness, novel gaps identified, citation impact of resulting survey.
**Expected Outcomes**: Publication-ready comprehensive survey identifying 3-5 concrete research gaps.

### Experiment 2: Theoretical Framework Development
**Hypothesis**: Mathematical analysis and theoretical modeling can provide new insights without empirical validation.
**Setup**: Develop formal mathematical frameworks, proofs, or theoretical models based on survey findings.
**Baselines**: Compare theoretical predictions against published empirical results from literature.
**Evaluation Metrics**: Mathematical rigor, consistency with existing empirical evidence, novel theoretical insights generated.
**Expected Outcomes**: Theoretical contribution with testable predictions for future empirical work.

### Experiment 3: Meta-Analysis of Published Results
**Hypothesis**: Aggregating and reanalyzing published experimental results will reveal patterns invisible in individual studies.
**Setup**: Collect numerical results from published papers, standardize metrics, perform statistical meta-analysis.
**Baselines**: Individual study results vs. aggregated trends.
**Evaluation Metrics**: Effect sizes, statistical significance of meta-trends, number of studies included.
**Expected Outcomes**: Meta-analysis revealing cross-study patterns and recommendations for future research.

## 4. Resources

**People**:
- Solo researcher (primary)
- Domain expert advisors (2-3 for feedback)
- Potential collaborators with compute access (for future validation)

**Tools**:
- Academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, ACL Anthology)
- Reference management software (Zotero, Mendeley)
- Statistical analysis tools (R, Python with scipy/pandas)
- Mathematical typesetting (LaTeX)
- Collaboration platforms (Overleaf, GitHub)

**Datasets**:
- Published experimental results from literature
- Publicly available benchmark datasets (for analysis, not training)
- Citation networks and bibliometric data

**Compute**: None required for core research activities.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Limited novelty in survey-only work | Medium | High | Focus on identifying concrete gaps and providing theoretical frameworks |
| Theoretical work lacks empirical validation | High | Medium | Collaborate with compute-enabled researchers for validation |
| Meta-analysis reveals no significant patterns | Medium | Medium | Ensure sufficient sample size and consider multiple analysis approaches |
| Difficulty accessing paywalled papers | Medium | Medium | Use institutional access, preprints, and author contact |
| Limited impact without empirical results | High | High | Position work as foundation for future empirical studies |

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-up Directions

- **Collaborative Validation**: Partner with researchers who have compute to empirically test theoretical predictions
- **Benchmark Creation**: Design new evaluation protocols that can be implemented by others [P1]
- **Tool Development**: Create analysis tools or frameworks that others can use
- **Workshop Organization**: Host workshops to gather community input on identified research gaps
- **Grant Applications**: Use theoretical contributions to secure funding for future empirical work
- **Industry Partnerships**: Collaborate with companies that can provide compute resources for validation
