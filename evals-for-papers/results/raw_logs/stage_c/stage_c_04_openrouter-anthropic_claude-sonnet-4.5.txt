## **Mindset Shifts**

**1. Compute is not the bottleneck for insight**
- Many ICML/NeurIPS papers use <100 GPU hours
- Theory papers use zero compute
- Analysis papers use minimal compute

**2. Constraints breed creativity**
- Limited compute forces you to think harder about problem formulation
- Often leads to more elegant solutions

**3. Impact ≠ Compute**
- Attention mechanism paper (2017): Relatively small experiments, 100,000+ citations
- BERT paper: Large compute, but many follow-ups used small models
- Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Modest compute, huge impact

**4. Community values diverse contributions**
- Not everyone can/should train giant models
- Field needs theory, benchmarks, analysis, reproducibility

## **Success Stories (Low/No Compute)**

1. **"Attention Is All You Need"** (2017): Transformer architecture—experiments on modest hardware by today's standards
2. **"The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"** (2019): Pruning insights from small-scale experiments
3. **"GLUE Benchmark"** (2018): Dataset curation, minimal compute
4. **"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots"** (2021): Critical analysis, zero compute
5. **Countless theory papers** in top venues with zero empirical work

## **Bottom Line**

**You can do meaningful research with zero compute by:**

1. **Focusing on theory** (proofs, algorithms, analysis)
2. **Leveraging free resources** (Colab, Kaggle, cloud credits)
3. **Creating datasets/benchmarks** (high-impact, low-compute)
4. **Analyzing existing models** (inference is cheap)
5. **Collaborating** (offer skills in exchange for compute)

**Recommended starting point:**
- Pick one of the project ideas above that excites you
- Spend 2 weeks on literature review
- Identify specific gap you can address with available resources
- Start with smallest possible experiment on Colab
- Build from there

The constraint of zero compute can actually be an **advantage**—it forces you to focus on ideas rather than brute force, and the field desperately needs more conceptual contributions.
