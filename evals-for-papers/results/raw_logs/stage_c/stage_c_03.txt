# Turnkey Research Execution Plan: AI for Cancer Research

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Primary Goal**: Develop AI systems that significantly improve cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and drug discovery timelines [P1][P3]. This research focuses on tractable, high-impact problems rather than attempting to "cure cancer" immediately [G8][G13].

**Specific Objectives**:
- Improve early-stage cancer detection accuracy by 15-20% using AI-enhanced medical imaging [P4][P6]
- Reduce drug resistance prediction error by 25% through precision therapy selection [P2][P8]
- Accelerate target identification in drug discovery by 6-12 months [P1][P7]

**Problem Scope**: Focus on well-defined, measurable improvements in existing cancer care workflows rather than revolutionary breakthroughs [G7][G14].

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: AI-Enhanced Cancer Detection in Medical Imaging
**Hypothesis**: Deep learning models can improve early-stage cancer detection accuracy compared to current radiological assessment [P4][P6].
**Setup**: Train convolutional neural networks on multi-modal imaging data (CT, MRI, PET) with radiologist annotations
**Baselines**: Current radiologist performance, existing FDA-approved AI diagnostic tools
**Evaluation Metrics**: Sensitivity, specificity, AUC, time-to-diagnosis
**Expected Outcome**: 10-15% improvement in early-stage detection accuracy

### Experiment 2: Drug Resistance Prediction Model
**Hypothesis**: AI models using genomic and clinical data can predict treatment resistance before it occurs [P2][P8].
**Setup**: Develop ensemble models combining genomic sequencing, clinical history, and treatment response data
**Baselines**: Standard clinical prediction models, oncologist predictions
**Evaluation Metrics**: Prediction accuracy, false positive/negative rates, clinical utility scores
**Expected Outcome**: 20-25% reduction in resistance prediction error

### Experiment 3: AI-Accelerated Drug Target Identification
**Hypothesis**: Machine learning can identify novel drug targets faster than traditional methods [P1][P7].
**Setup**: Apply graph neural networks to protein-protein interaction networks and genomic data
**Baselines**: Traditional biochemical screening, existing computational methods
**Evaluation Metrics**: Time to target identification, validation success rate, novelty of targets
**Expected Outcome**: 30-40% reduction in target identification time
