1) Problem framing and goals
- Reality check: “Cure cancer with AI tomorrow” is infeasible. A 6‑month, publication-grade plan can target clinically meaningful, measurable improvements in treatment selection and outcome prediction that align with current evidence and reporting standards. A scoping review shows very few oncology ML models achieve external validation and clinical utility; your plan should prioritize these gaps [P1].
- Primary objective: Build and externally validate a calibrated, decision-usable predictor of immunotherapy benefit using readily accessible clinical and/or blood biomarkers, with extensions to multimodal fusion when available. This follows recent evidence that routine clinical data can identify checkpoint inhibitor benefit at scale and that multimodal fusion generally outperforms single-modality models [P8][P2].
- Secondary objectives:
  - Multimodal survival modeling (OS/PFS) across public cohorts (TCGA/CPTAC/TCIA/METABRIC) with rigorous calibration, net benefit, and transportability assessment [P2][P4].
  - Prepare a prospective, “silent mode” evaluation protocol following TRIPOD-AI/PROBAST-AI and CONSORT-AI/SPIRIT-AI guidance to accelerate clinical translation [1][2][4][5].

Key success criteria by 6 months
- Statistically significant improvement over strong baselines on external validation (e.g., AUROC/C-index, time-dependent AUC, IBS).
- Demonstrated clinical utility via decision-curve analysis with positive net benefit across clinically relevant thresholds [6][7].
- Transparent reporting and bias assessment per TRIPOD-AI/PROBAST-AI and radiomics readiness (RQS 2.0 where applicable) [1][2][P4].

2) Experiments
Experiment 1: Predict immunotherapy benefit from routine clinical data (baseline-to-practice track)
- Hypothesis: A rigorously validated ML model using routine labs and clinical variables will predict benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across multiple cancers, similar to recent multi-center findings [P8].
- Setup:
  - Data: Assemble multi-cancer ICI cohorts with routine labs and outcomes. Start with any accessible public or institutional cohorts; if limited, target a single tumor type first (e.g., urothelial carcinoma IMvigor210-like clinical variables; use DAC-permitted access where possible) [12]; augment with published features known to correlate with ICI outcomes (e.g., blood counts) [P8].
  - Features: Demographics, comorbidities, line of therapy, ECOG, CBC/differentials, chemistries, inflammatory ratios, time-varying updates if available.
  - Models: Penalized logistic regression, XGBoost, tab-transformer; apply robust feature preprocessing and leakage controls.
  - Validation: Nested CV on development sites; hold-out external site or cohort if available; temporal validation if external site unavailable.
- Baselines: Clinician-chosen heuristics (e.g., NLR thresholds), logistic regression with L2, and gradient boosting.
- Metrics: AUROC/PR, calibration slope/Intercept, Brier score; decision-curve analysis (net benefit) at thresholds reflecting ICI initiation decisions [6][7].
- Expected outcomes: Competitive AUROC with strong calibration; positive net benefit across clinically plausible thresholds; external validation demonstrates transportability (or quantifies gaps) [P8][P1].

Experiment 2: Late-fusion multimodal survival prediction (clinical + genomics ± pathology/radiology)
- Hypothesis: Late fusion of clinical and molecular (± imaging) features improves OS/PFS prediction over single-modality models [P2].
- Setup:
  - Data: TCGA Pan-Cancer with clinical, mutations, expression [9]; CPTAC cohorts with WSI and proteogenomic data [10]; TCIA collections for radiology where available [8]. Tumor-specific subsets (e.g., BRCA via METABRIC) [11].
  - Models: CoxPH and DeepSurv baselines; Random Survival Forests; late-fusion networks combining modality-specific encoders; if images are included, use pretrained encoders for WSI (e.g., ViT/CLAM-style) and radiomics features curated per RQS 2.0 [P4].
  - Validation: Stratified temporal splits per study; cross-cohort validation (train on TCGA, test on CPTAC where label definitions align).
- Baselines: CoxPH with clinical only; DeepSurv with clinical; single-modality models (genomics-only, imaging-only).
- Metrics: C-index, time-dependent AUC, Integrated Brier Score (IBS); calibration curves; decision-curve analysis for risk thresholds relevant to adjuvant therapy selection [6][7].
- Expected outcomes: Late fusion improves discrimination and reduces IBS vs. single-modality and CoxPH baselines [P2]; RQS 2.0 checklist met for any radiomics components [P4].

Experiment 3: External validation and model updating
- Hypothesis: Models trained on one cohort degrade in external cohorts; simple updating (recalibration, intercept/slope adjustment, transfer learning for encoders) restores performance [P1].
- Setup:
  - Train Experiment 1 and/or 2 models on a source cohort; evaluate on a target cohort differing in geography or time period.
  - Apply recalibration (Platt, isotonic), intercept/slope adjustment, and domain adaptation for images if present.
- Baselines: No update vs. recalibration vs. simple refit with small target sample.
- Metrics: Delta in AUROC/C-index, calibration slope/Intercept; Net benefit pre- and post-update [6][7].
- Expected outcomes: Demonstrable improvement in calibration and net benefit after updating; transparent reporting per TRIPOD-AI and risk-of-bias assessment via PROBAST-AI [1][2].

Experiment 4: Biology-guided histology biomarkers for ICI response (feasibility extension)
- Hypothesis: Histology-derived representations can infer immune microenvironment features predictive of ICI outcomes, complementing clinicogenomic data [P5].
- Setup:
  - Data: CPTAC WSI for relevant tumor types with transcriptomic immune signatures; where linked ICI outcomes are unavailable, use surrogate tasks (e.g., TME/immune scores) and then test transfer to small ICI cohorts if feasible [10].
  - Models: Weakly supervised WSI MIL models; biology-guided targets (e.g., immune signatures) as auxiliary tasks [P5].
- Baselines: Clinicogenomic-only models; image-only models without biology-guided targets.
- Metrics: For surrogate tasks, AUROC/PR for immune signatures; for ICI outcomes, AUROC and calibration; ablation to quantify added value of WSI features.
- Expected outcomes: Image features add incremental value to clinicogenomic predictors and/or improve generalization when combined via late fusion [P5][P2].

Experiment 5: Clinical utility and reporting rigor
- Hypothesis: Models with similar discrimination can differ in clinical utility; explicit DCA, calibration, and transparent reporting change deployment decisions [6][1][2].
- Setup: For best model(s) from Experiments 1–4, run DCA across stakeholder-defined thresholds; pre-register a reporting checklist per TRIPOD-AI and assess risk of bias with PROBAST-AI; if planning a prospective pilot, align with SPIRIT-AI/CONSORT-AI [1][2][4][5].
- Baselines: Utility assessed only by AUROC/C-index without DCA.
- Metrics: Net benefit curves with confidence intervals; calibration curves; TRIPOD-AI/PROBAST-AI compliance scores.
- Expected outcomes: Clear net benefit at decision thresholds; complete reporting artifacts ready for submission [1][2][4][5].

5) Risks and mitigations table
- Limited external validation cohorts for ICI response — Mitigation: prioritize routine lab–based models (broader availability), use temporal/geographic splits; pursue DAC access (IMvigor210) and report transportability gaps [P8][12].
- Data shift and heterogeneity across centers — Mitigation: harmonize variables; apply model updating (recalibration) and domain adaptation; quantify drift impact [P1].
- Label noise (RECIST variability, incomplete outcomes) — Mitigation: adjudicate with clear rules; sensitivity analyses; robust loss functions; exclude ambiguous cases.
- Information leakage — Mitigation: strict separation of preprocessing fit on training only; nested CV; audit pipelines; TRIPOD-AI checklist [1].
- Overfitting in multimodal fusion — Mitigation: modality dropout, strong regularization, early stopping; ablative baselines; report RQS and calibration [P4].
- Limited clinical utility despite good AUROC — Mitigation: emphasize calibration, net benefit with clinically chosen thresholds; iterate with clinicians on thresholds [6][7].
- Bias and inequities across subgroups — Mitigation: subgroup performance reporting; reweighting or group-specific calibration; PROBAST-AI assessment [2].

6) Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) modeling: emulate RCTs for adjuvant chemo/hormonal therapy in METABRIC using doubly robust learners; validate with negative controls and sensitivity analyses. Report per TRIPOD-AI and causal reporting best practices (acknowledging untestable assumptions) [1].
- Foundation models: Precompute WSI and radiology embeddings; test parameter-efficient fusion to reduce compute, inspired by biology-guided signals [P5] and multimodal fusion gains [P2].
- Trial matching: Prototype NLP for eligibility criteria parsing and patient–trial mapping; align evaluation with CONSORT-AI/SPIRIT-AI for future prospective studies [4][5].
- Prospective “silent mode” deployment: integrate model outputs into clinic without affecting decisions to collect real-world calibration and utility signals; design per SPIRIT-AI [5].

Optional next step
- If you can share which tumor type and what data you can access in weeks 0–1 (routine labs only vs. multimodal), I can lock the milestones to datasets, variables, and model specs and generate a preregistered analysis plan template aligned to TRIPOD-AI.
