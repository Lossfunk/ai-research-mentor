**Intuition**: "Curing cancer" is a decades-long, multi-billion-dollar endeavor involving thousands of researchers across biology, chemistry, medicine, and computation. Treating it as a single problem you can solve "tomorrow" ignores the complexity and sets you up for frustration [G15]. Good research starts by decomposing grand challenges into tractable sub-problems where you can get a clear signal within weeks, not years [G3][G12].

**Why this is principled**: Research mentorship guidelines emphasize choosing problems with high tractability—roughly a 10% chance of meaningful progress with one doubling of resources [G23]. Hamming's classic advice is to focus on *important* problems, but ones where you can actually make progress given your constraints [G15]. Effective researchers iterate quickly in an explore-understand loop [G2], which requires scoping problems small enough to test hypotheses and get feedback.

## Let's Reframe This

Before I can help you design a realistic plan, I need to understand your actual situation:

1. **Background & Resources**: What's your current role (student, industry researcher, hobbyist)? What compute, data access, and weekly time do you have?
2. **Specific Interest**: What aspect of cancer + AI excites you? (e.g., drug discovery, radiology, genomics, treatment optimization, early detection?)
3. **Timeline & Milestones**: What's your real deadline? Are you aiming for a course project, thesis chapter, startup prototype, or long-term research program?
4. **Collaboration & Mentorship**: Do you have access to domain experts (oncologists, biologists) or are you working solo?
5. **Current Bottleneck**: What's blocking you right now—lack of direction, no dataset, unclear methods, or something else?

## A Realistic Path Forward (Conditional on Your Answers)

Here's how we'd scope this depending on your context:

### If you're a **student or early researcher** (≤20 hrs/week, modest compute):
- **Phase 0 (2 weeks)**: Pick *one* narrow cancer AI task with public data (e.g., histopathology image classification on TCGA, or predicting drug response on DepMap cell lines). Reproduce a recent baseline paper's main result within 10% relative error. Keep a prediction log: before running each experiment, write down what you expect and why.
- **Deliverables**: (1) Reproduced figure or metric, (2) experiment card for one ablation (e.g., "Does data augmentation help?" with hypothesis, test, and stop rule).

### If you have **industry resources** (GPUs, collaborators, full-time):
- **Phase 0 (2 weeks)**: Identify a specific bottleneck in an existing clinical AI pipeline (e.g., false-positive reduction in lung nodule detection, or improving interpretability of treatment recommendation models). Run a scoping study: collect 3 recent papers, reproduce one key result, and propose 2 modifications.
- **Deliverables**: (1) Reproduction artifact, (2) experiment card testing one modification with clear success criteria.

### If you're **exploring** (no clear project yet):
- Spend 1 week doing a structured literature review: read 5 recent survey papers on AI in oncology (I can help find these), and for each, write a 1-paragraph summary of the *unsolved* problem that excites you most. Then we'll use a problem-selection rubric (importance, tractability, surprise, generality, mechanistic payoff) to score your top 3 ideas and pick one scoring ≥10/15 [G12][G17].

## Next Actions (Pick One Path)

1. **Answer the five intake questions above** so I can tailor a concrete 2-week Phase 0 plan.
2. **Tell me a specific cancer AI sub-problem** you're already interested in (even vaguely), and I'll help you scope it and find baselines.
3. **Ask me to run a literature search** on a particular cancer AI area (e.g., "AI for drug discovery in oncology") and I'll surface recent work + tractable entry points.

Let's turn that ambition into a project you can actually start this week.
