First, scope and realism: “Cure cancer tomorrow” is not scientifically feasible. A near-term, high-impact AI objective is to improve precision oncology decisions (e.g., identify patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy and infer actionable biomarkers) using routine data such as H&E whole-slide images (WSIs), clinical variables, and available genomics. Below is a turnkey, publication-grade plan to develop and validate such models with rigorous methodology and external validation. Where claims are supported by the literature, I cite sources. For medical-AI reporting and evaluation, I follow established guidelines (TRIPOD-AI, STARD, CONSORT-AI/SPIRIT-AI, CLAIM) [1,2,3,4,5].

1) Problem framing and goals

Goal: Build and externally validate deployable AI models that:
- Predict microsatellite instability (MSI) from H&E WSIs with AUROC ≥0.90 on external cohorts and calibration ECE ≤0.05; accuracy not worse than −10% relative to internal [10].
- Predict tumor mutational burden (TMB-hi vs TMB-lo cutoff 10 mut/Mb) from H&E WSIs with AUROC ≥0.75 external and ECE ≤0.07; net benefit improvement ≥0.05 at clinically relevant thresholds [12].
- Predict PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor benefit (objective response within 6 months and/or PFS/OS improvement) from multimodal inputs (WSI + clinical ± genomics) with time-dependent C-index ≥0.65 and hazard ratio (HR) ≥2.0 between top vs bottom tertiles of predicted benefit on external cohort; net benefit ≥0.05 [14].
- Ensure robustness: ≤10% performance drop between internal validation and at least one external site; pass decision-curve utility checks; report per-TCGA cancer-type subgroup performance where relevant [1,4].
- Success criteria: All targets met with pre-registered analysis plan, patient-level splits (no slide leakage), calibration, and transparent reporting per TRIPOD-AI/CLAIM [1,5]. If external performance falls >10% below internal or calibration fails (ECE >0.1), trigger remediation.

2) Experiments (5 total; each with baselines, ablations, thresholds)

Shared setup across experiments
- Data:
  - TCGA (COAD/READ for MSI; pan-cancer for TMB; curated ICI-treated subsets when available for outcomes), CPTAC as an external WSI source; dedicated NSCLC PD-L1 dataset for immune context supervision [P2].
  - For ICI response: public cohorts with response/PFS/OS labels and clinical covariates; if paired WSIs are limited, use multi-institution retrospective cohorts via data use agreements; define go/no-go if access fails by Month 2.
- Preprocessing:
  - WSI tiling at 20× (0.5 µm/px), 256–512 px tiles; tissue detection; Macenko/Vahadane stain normalization; tile rejection for artifacts; patch-level features from ImageNet- or self-supervised ViT (DINOv2) encoders; multi-magnification pyramids for MIL [P6,P5].
  - Optional segmentation prompts for tissue compartments leveraging SAM variants tailored to WSI [P1].
- Splits:
  - Patient-level stratified splits; internal 5-fold CV; external validation by site/cohort to assess domain shift [1,4].
- Metrics:
  - Classification: AUROC, AUPRC, balanced accuracy, calibration (ECE, Brier), subgroup AUROC.
  - Survival: Harrell’s C-index, time-dependent AUROC, log-rank p, HR (Cox); decision-curve analysis (net benefit).
- Reporting: TRIPOD-AI, STARD items for diagnostic tasks; protocol preregistration for outcome models (SPIRIT-AI), with prospective analysis of model performance and calibration [1,2,3,4,5].

4) Resources

Compute
- Feature extraction from WSIs:
  - 1,500–3,000 slides; 20×, ~1e5–3e5 tiles/slide; precompute ViT-B/16 features on 8× A100 80GB: ~0.3–0.6 GPU-hr/slide → 450–1,800 GPU-hrs total (parallelizable).
- MIL training:
  - Per task (MSI, TMB, PD-L1): 1× A100 40–80GB; 10–20 GPU-hrs per training run; 30–60 runs including ablations → 300–1,200 GPU-hrs.
- Multimodal survival models:
  - 1× A100 40GB; 5–10 GPU-hrs/run; ~100–200 GPU-hrs total.
- Storage: 50–100 TB for WSIs and features; fast SSD/NVMe scratch.

Datasets
- TCGA-COAD/READ (MSI), TCGA pan-cancer (TMB from MAF files; harmonized clinical).
- CPTAC WSIs for external validation (site/scanner shift).
- NSCLC PD-L1 annotated dataset (H&E, PD-L1 IHC) [P2].
- ICI-treated cohorts with paired WSI + outcomes (institutional or public; document inclusion/exclusion and censoring rules).
- Splits: patient-level; reserve external cohorts; prevent multiple slides per patient across splits [1,4].

Tooling and libraries
- PyTorch 2.3+, timm 1.0+, MONAI 1.3+, scikit-learn 1.5+, lifelines 0.27, pycox 0.3.
- WSI: OpenSlide 3.4.1, cuCIM 24.04, tiatoolbox 1.4.
- Stain tools: histomicstk or StainTools.
- Repro: Hydra/Weights & Biases, Docker/Singularity; model cards per CLAIM [5].

5) Risks and mitigations

- Risk: Data leakage (patient-level) inflates results.
  - Probability: Medium; Impact: High.
  - Mitigation: Strict patient-level splits; unit tests to detect cross-split MRNs/IDs; audit logs; independent statistician review [1,4,5].

- Risk: External generalization gap >10%.
  - Probability: Medium; Impact: High.
  - Mitigation: Robust augmentation and data enrichment [P4]; domain-aware calibration; multi-site validation and error analysis; predefine fail-forward criteria.

- Risk: Limited ICI cohorts with WSIs and outcomes.
  - Probability: Medium; Impact: Medium.
  - Mitigation: Early data access agreements; start with cancer types where data exist (NSCLC, melanoma); fall back to surrogate endpoints (PD-L1, TMB) and prospective data collection plan [2,3].

- Risk: Label noise for PD-L1/TMB thresholds.
  - Probability: Medium; Impact: Medium.
  - Mitigation: Sensitivity analyses across thresholds; robust losses; report uncertainty and calibration bands.

- Risk: Calibration drift across sites.
  - Probability: Medium; Impact: Medium.
  - Mitigation: Site-wise recalibration (isotonic/Platt), report ECE/Brier per site; deploy with periodic calibration monitoring [1,4].

- Risk: Reproducibility gaps and reporting deficiencies.
  - Probability: Low; Impact: High.
  - Mitigation: Follow TRIPOD-AI/CLAIM checklists; preregister protocols; release code and model cards [1,5].

- Risk: Overfitting to morphology proxies not causally tied to biology.
  - Probability: Medium; Impact: Medium.
  - Mitigation: Concept-aligned MIL and pathologist review [P8]; causal sensitivity analyses; external biological correlates.

6) Integrated recipe and scaling study

- Integrated pipeline:
  - Train robust MIL encoders (E1–E3) to infer MSI, TMB, PD-L1/TIME phenotypes from H&E. These serve as slide-level embeddings that capture biomarker-relevant morphology.
  - Fuse these embeddings with clinical/genomic covariates for ICI-benefit modeling (E4). Use decision-curve analysis to quantify clinical utility vs standard-of-care baselines (clinical+TMB/PD-L1) [14,1].
  - Use robustness study (E5) to select augmentation/normalization that optimize Pareto front of accuracy vs calibration vs generalization (plot AUROC vs ECE vs external drop). Conduct sensitivity analyses over:
    - Magnification and encoder size (ViT-B vs ViT-L).
    - Data scale (number of slides/patients) and class balance.
    - Thresholds (TMB 10 vs 13 mut/Mb; PD-L1 1/50% TPS).
- Pareto/Scaling:
  - Fit log-linear scaling laws for performance vs number of slides and vs number of institutions; target marginal gains where external drop ≤0.02 while ECE ≤0.05.
  - Report per-cancer-type Pareto fronts to inform where deployment is viable first (e.g., MSI-rich subsets in colorectal) [10].

Concrete, falsifiable experiments summary
- E1: MSI AUROC ≥0.87 external, ECE ≤0.1 (falsify otherwise) [10].
- E2: TMB AUROC ≥0.72 external, ECE ≤0.1; net benefit +0.05 (falsify otherwise) [12].
- E3: PD-L1 AUROC ≥0.74 external; ρ ≥0.35 with TIME (falsify otherwise) [P2,14].
- E4: ICI benefit C-index ≥0.62 and HR ≥1.6 external; net benefit +0.05 (falsify otherwise) [14].
- E5: External drop reduction ≥30% via robustness methods (falsify otherwise) [P4].

State-of-the-art baselines and anchors
- MSI from H&E (Kather et al., 2019, Nat Med) [10].
- TMB from WSIs (recent DL study) [12].
- PD-L1 from H&E and ICI outcome modeling [14].
- WSI MIL and segmentation foundations [P5,P6,P1].
- Multi-stain/fusion for histopathology [P3].
- Reporting standards for medical AI [1,2,3,4,5].

Key takeaways
- The plan focuses on deployable, high-utility prediction tasks with strong literature precedent (MSI, TMB, PD-L1, ICI benefit) and rigorous evaluation per medical-AI guidelines.
- Success hinges on external validation, calibration, and clinical utility demonstrations, not just internal AUROC.
- If targets are met, proceed to a prospective study under CONSORT-AI/SPIRIT-AI to assess real-world impact [2,3].
