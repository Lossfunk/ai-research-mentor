# AI-Driven Cancer Research Execution Plan

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Primary Goal**: Develop AI systems that meaningfully advance cancer treatment through three tractable pathways: biomarker discovery, treatment optimization, and drug target identification [P1][P5].

**Specific Objectives**:
- Create AI models for early-stage biomarker detection from routine clinical data [P8]
- Develop treatment response prediction systems using multimodal patient data [P2]
- Build drug-target interaction prediction models for novel therapeutic discovery [P6]

**Success Criteria**: Achieve clinically relevant performance metrics (>85% sensitivity/specificity for biomarker detection, >70% accuracy for treatment response prediction) with validation on independent datasets [G23].

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: AI-Powered Biomarker Discovery
**Hypothesis**: Deep learning models can identify novel cancer biomarkers from routine blood work and imaging data that outperform current clinical markers [P5].

**Setup**: 
- Train transformer-based models on multi-institutional datasets (10,000+ patients)
- Input: Complete blood count, metabolic panels, CT/MRI features
- Architecture: Multi-modal fusion network with attention mechanisms

**Baselines**: Current clinical biomarkers (PSA, CA-125, CEA), logistic regression, random forest

**Evaluation Metrics**: AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, time-to-detection

**Expected Outcome**: 10-15% improvement over existing biomarkers with 6-month earlier detection capability

### Experiment 2: Treatment Response Prediction
**Hypothesis**: AI models integrating genomic, imaging, and clinical data can predict treatment response better than current clinical decision tools [P2][P8].

**Setup**:
- Multi-modal deep learning on genomic sequencing, radiomics, and electronic health records
- Target: 6-month progression-free survival and treatment toxicity
- Cross-validation across cancer types (breast, lung, colorectal)

**Baselines**: Oncotype DX, clinical staging systems, physician predictions

**Evaluation Metrics**: C-index, calibration plots, decision curve analysis, clinical utility metrics

**Expected Outcome**: 15-20% improvement in prediction accuracy, reducing unnecessary treatments by 25%

### Experiment 3: AI-Driven Drug Target Discovery
**Hypothesis**: Graph neural networks can identify novel drug-target interactions by learning from protein structure, pathway data, and existing drug databases [P1][P6].

**Setup**:
- Graph neural network on protein-protein interaction networks
- Input: 3D protein structures, pathway annotations, known drug interactions
- Output: Ranked list of potential drug targets with confidence scores

**Baselines**: Traditional structure-based drug design, random selection, expert curation

**Evaluation Metrics**: Hit rate in experimental validation, novelty score, druggability assessment

**Expected Outcome**: Identify 5-10 high-confidence novel targets with >30% experimental validation rate

- Imaging datasets (TCIA, institutional PACS)

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Data quality/bias issues | High | High | Multi-institutional validation, bias detection algorithms, diverse patient populations |
| Regulatory approval delays | Medium | High | Early FDA engagement, pre-submission meetings, regulatory consultant |
| Model overfitting to training data | Medium | High | Rigorous cross-validation, external validation, temporal validation |
| Clinical adoption resistance | Medium | Medium | Clinician involvement from start, interpretable models, gradual deployment |
| Computational resource constraints | Low | Medium | Cloud scaling agreements, model compression techniques |
| Patient privacy concerns | Low | High | Federated learning approaches, differential privacy, strict data governance |

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-up Directions

**Immediate Extensions**:
- Federated learning across international cancer centers to increase dataset diversity
- Real-time treatment optimization using reinforcement learning [P2]
- Integration with liquid biopsy technologies for ultra-early detection

**Long-term Vision**:
- Personalized cancer vaccines designed by AI from tumor genomics
- AI-guided clinical trial design and patient stratification
- Integration with robotic surgery systems for real-time decision support

**Novel Methodologies**:
- Causal inference methods to identify true therapeutic targets vs. correlations
- Multi-agent systems for complex treatment protocol optimization
- Quantum-enhanced drug discovery for previously intractable targets

The research should focus on tractable problems with clear clinical utility rather than attempting to "cure cancer" overnight [G8][G13]. Success will be measured by meaningful improvements in patient outcomes through better detection, prediction, and treatment selection [G1][G4].
