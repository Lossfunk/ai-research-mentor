Based on current research, here's a comprehensive research plan for applying GNNs to sea ice:

## Research Plan: Graph Neural Networks for Sea Ice

### 1. **Problem Definition & Scope**

**Primary Research Questions:**
- Can GNNs capture the spatial dependencies and physical interactions in sea ice dynamics better than traditional CNNs or physics-based models?
- How do different graph construction strategies (e.g., spatial proximity, physical connectivity) affect prediction accuracy?
- Can GNNs effectively model multi-scale sea ice processes (floe-level interactions to basin-scale patterns)?

**Target Applications:**
- Sub-seasonal to seasonal sea ice forecasting
- Sea ice concentration/thickness prediction
- Ice floe collision and deformation modeling
- Emulation of computationally expensive ice-sheet models

### 2. **Literature Foundation**

Recent work shows promising directions:
- **IceGAT** uses graph attention networks for Arctic sea ice prediction with multi-scale modeling [1]
- GNNs have been applied to emulate ice-sheet models as computationally efficient alternatives [2]
- Graph-based approaches for modeling colliding ice floes capture physical interactions [3]
- Deep GNNs for spatiotemporal forecasting of sub-seasonal sea ice [4]

### 3. **Proposed Methodology**

#### **Phase 1: Graph Construction (Months 1-2)**

**Experiment 1: Compare graph construction strategies**
- **Hypothesis:** Adaptive graph construction based on ice dynamics will outperform fixed spatial grids
- **Method:** Implement and compare:
  - k-nearest neighbors in spatial coordinates
  - Radius-based connectivity (e.g., 100-500 km)
  - Adaptive graphs based on ice drift patterns
  - Delaunay triangulation for irregular grids
- **Metrics:** Graph density, computational cost, downstream prediction accuracy
- **Expected outcome:** Identify optimal graph topology for different spatial scales

**Experiment 2: Multi-scale graph representations**
- **Hypothesis:** Hierarchical graphs capturing both local (floe-level) and regional (basin-scale) interactions improve forecasting
- **Method:** Build multi-resolution graphs with:
  - Fine-scale nodes (25 km resolution)
  - Coarse-scale nodes (100 km resolution)
  - Cross-scale edges connecting hierarchies
- **Metrics:** Prediction skill at different lead times (1-day to 6-month)
- **Expected outcome:** Quantify the benefit of multi-scale modeling

#### **Phase 2: Model Architecture (Months 3-5)**

**Experiment 3: GNN architecture comparison**
- **Hypothesis:** Attention-based GNNs will better capture anisotropic ice dynamics than standard message-passing
- **Method:** Benchmark:
  - Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
  - Graph Attention Networks (GAT) - following IceGAT approach
  - GraphSAGE for large-scale graphs
  - Temporal GNNs (e.g., TGCN, DCRNN)
- **Baseline comparisons:** CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM, persistence model
- **Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE), spatial correlation
- **Expected outcome:** Identify architecture-performance tradeoffs

**Key design choices:**
- Node features: ice concentration, thickness, temperature, drift velocity, atmospheric forcing
- Edge features: distance, relative velocity, wind stress
- Temporal modeling: recurrent connections, temporal attention, or autoregressive prediction

#### **Phase 3: Physical Constraints & Interpretability (Months 6-8)**

**Experiment 4: Physics-informed GNN**
- **Hypothesis:** Incorporating conservation laws and thermodynamic constraints will improve generalization
- **Method:** 
  - Add physics-based loss terms (mass conservation, momentum balance)
  - Compare with purely data-driven GNN
  - Test on out-of-distribution scenarios (extreme ice loss years)
- **Metrics:** Physical consistency checks, generalization to unseen climate regimes
- **Expected outcome:** Demonstrate improved robustness and physical plausibility

**Experiment 5: Interpretability analysis**
- **Method:**
  - Attention weight visualization to identify critical spatial connections
  - Ablation studies on node/edge features
  - Compare learned patterns with known physical processes (e.g., ice-albedo feedback, wind-driven drift)
- **Expected outcome:** Validate that GNN learns physically meaningful relationships

### 4. **Data Requirements**

**Primary datasets:**
- **Satellite observations:** NSIDC Sea Ice Index, SSMIS passive microwave data
- **Reanalysis:** ERA5 atmospheric forcing, ocean currents
- **Model output:** PIOMAS ice thickness, CMIP6 ensemble members for training diversity

**Preprocessing:**
- Regrid to consistent spatial resolution
- Handle missing data (cloud cover, polar night)
- Train/validation/test split: temporal (e.g., 1979-2010 / 2011-2015 / 2016-2023)

### 5. **Evaluation Strategy**

**Metrics:**
- Spatial: RMSE, pattern correlation, Integrated Ice Edge Error
- Temporal: skill at different lead times (daily to seasonal)
- Extreme events: detection of rapid ice loss events
- Computational: inference time vs. physics-based models

**Benchmarks:**
- Statistical: persistence, climatology, linear regression
- ML baselines: CNN-LSTM, Transformer models
- Physics-based: CICE sea ice model output

### 6. **Expected Contributions**

1. **Methodological:** Novel graph construction strategies tailored to sea ice dynamics
2. **Empirical:** Quantified performance gains over existing approaches
3. **Scientific:** Interpretable insights into spatial dependencies in sea ice evolution
4. **Practical:** Computationally efficient emulator for operational forecasting

### 7. **Potential Challenges & Mitigation**

- **Challenge:** Irregular observation coverage in polar regions
  - *Mitigation:* Use graph structure to naturally handle sparse/irregular data
  
- **Challenge:** Long-range dependencies (e.g., teleconnections)
  - *Mitigation:* Test deeper GNNs, hierarchical graphs, or hybrid GNN-Transformer

- **Challenge:** Limited training data for extreme events
  - *Mitigation:* Data augmentation, transfer learning from climate model ensembles

### 8. **Timeline (8-12 months)**

- Months 1-2: Data collection, graph construction experiments
- Months 3-5: Model development and architecture comparison
- Months 6-8: Physics-informed extensions and interpretability
- Months 9-10: Comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking
- Months 11-12: Paper writing and code release

### 9. **Success Criteria**

- 10-20% improvement in RMSE over CNN baselines at 1-month lead time

- Computational speedup of 10-100× over physics-based models
