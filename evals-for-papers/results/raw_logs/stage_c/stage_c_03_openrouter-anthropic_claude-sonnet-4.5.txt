## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Reality Check:**  
"Curing cancer with AI tomorrow" is not scientifically feasible. Cancer comprises >200 distinct diseases with heterogeneous biology, and clinical translation requires years of validation (Phase I–III trials typically span 7–15 years). However, AI can **accelerate** progress across the cancer care pipeline: drug discovery, early detection, treatment personalization, and resistance prediction.

**Reframed Problem:**  
Develop AI systems that demonstrably improve cancer outcomes within a 6-month research horizon by targeting high-impact, near-term applications where AI has shown promise but lacks rigorous benchmarking or clinical integration.

**Primary Goals (6-month scope):**
1. **Drug Discovery:** Use AI to identify novel cancer drug candidates or repurpose existing drugs, validated through *in silico* and preliminary *in vitro* assays
2. **Diagnostics:** Build AI models for early cancer detection or subtype classification from pathology/radiology, achieving performance parity or superiority to expert clinicians
3. **Treatment Optimization:** Develop personalized treatment recommendation systems using multi-omics data, validated on retrospective clinical cohorts
4. **Resistance Prediction:** Predict therapy resistance mechanisms using genomic/transcriptomic data to guide adaptive treatment strategies

**Scientific Contributions:**
- Benchmarked AI models on standardized oncology datasets with clinical-grade evaluation
- Open-source tools and pretrained models for cancer research community
- Proof-of-concept validation (computational + wet-lab) for top drug candidates
- Roadmap for regulatory-compliant AI deployment in oncology

**Ethical and Practical Constraints:**
- No patient recruitment or prospective trials (requires IRB, multi-year timeline)
- Focus on retrospective data and publicly available datasets
- Collaborate with oncologists for clinical validation and interpretation
- Transparent reporting of limitations and failure modes

- **Resistance scenarios:**
  - EGFR-mutant lung cancer → T790M resistance mutation
  - CML → BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations under TKI therapy

- **Task:** Cancer subtype classification from pathology images (from Experiment 2)
- **Federated learning protocol:**
  - FedAvg (baseline), FedProx (heterogeneity-robust), FedBN (batch norm adaptation)
  - Differential privacy (DP-SGD) with ε = 1.0, 5.0, 10.0
- **Data heterogeneity:**
  - Non-IID distribution: each institution has different cancer type prevalence
  - Varying data quality (simulate noise, staining artifacts)
- **Privacy analysis:**
  - Membership inference attacks to test privacy leakage
  - Reconstruction attacks on gradients

**Baselines:**
- Centralized training (upper bound, privacy-violating)

- Data pooling with anonymization (privacy risk)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Model performance:** AUROC, accuracy (federated vs. centralized gap)
- **Privacy:** Success rate of membership inference attacks, ε-differential privacy guarantee

- **Fairness:** Performance on each institution's test set (detect bias)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Federated learning achieves 92–94% of centralized performance (AUROC 0.93 vs. 0.95)
- Differential privacy (ε=5.0) reduces performance by 2–3% but prevents membership inference
- Communication cost: 10–20× lower than data pooling
- Federated model generalizes better to new institutions than local models

## Final Note on "Curing Cancer Tomorrow"

**The hard truth:** Cancer is not a single disease, and "curing" it requires decades of basic science, clinical trials, and regulatory approval. AI is a powerful accelerant, not a magic bullet. This 6-month plan focuses on **high-impact, near-term contributions** that advance the field:

- **Drug discovery:** Identifying candidates 10–100× faster than traditional methods
- **Diagnostics:** Improving early detection and reducing diagnostic errors
- **Treatment optimization:** Personalizing therapy to improve outcomes
- **Resistance prediction:** Staying ahead of cancer evolution

**Realistic impact timeline:**
- **6 months:** Computational validation, proof-of-concept results, publications
- **1–2 years:** Wet-lab validation, external clinical validation, regulatory consultation
- **3–5 years:** Prospective clinical trials (Phase I/II)
- **7–10 years:** FDA approval, clinical deployment (if successful)
- **10–20 years:** Population-level impact on cancer mortality

**Ethical imperative:** Avoid hype. Overclaiming ("AI cures cancer") damages public trust and harms patients who delay evidence-based treatment for unproven AI tools. Frame contributions honestly: "AI accelerates cancer research" or "AI improves diagnostic accuracy by X%."
