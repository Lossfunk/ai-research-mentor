## AI Research Without Python: Viable Paths Forward

Good news: **You can do meaningful AI research without Python**, though you'll eventually want to learn it. Here's a realistic plan based on your current situation.

---

## **Immediate Assessment: Choose Your Path**

### **Path A: Research Now, Learn Python Later** (Start immediately)
Focus on contributions that don't require coding, while gradually learning Python.

### **Path B: Learn Python First** (2-3 months investment)
Delay research to build foundational skills—often the faster path to productivity.

### **Path C: Collaborate & Contribute Non-Code Skills** (Hybrid approach)
Partner with coders, contribute other expertise.

**My recommendation:** **Path B if you're serious about AI research long-term** (Python is unavoidable), but **Path A or C if you want to contribute immediately** while learning.
