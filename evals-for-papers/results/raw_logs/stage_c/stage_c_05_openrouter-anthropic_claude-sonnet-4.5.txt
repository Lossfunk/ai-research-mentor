Based on the retrieved evidence and established knowledge of AI research pathways, I can now construct a comprehensive plan for conducting meaningful AI research without Python programming skills.

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Reality Check:**  
Not knowing Python does **not** disqualify you from AI research. Many high-impact contributions require minimal or zero coding: theoretical analysis, experimental design, benchmark creation, human evaluation studies, interdisciplinary applications, and conceptual frameworks. Additionally, no-code/low-code tools [1,2,3] now enable sophisticated ML experiments without programming.

**Core Insight:**  
AI research has multiple valid pathways:
- **Theoretical research:** Mathematical proofs, complexity analysis, algorithmic design (pen-and-paper)
- **Empirical research via no-code tools:** AutoML platforms, GUI-based frameworks
- **Human-centered research:** User studies, annotation, evaluation protocols
- **Interdisciplinary research:** Domain expertise (medicine, law, education) + AI collaboration
- **Conceptual research:** Frameworks, taxonomies, critical analysis

**Primary Goals (6-month scope):**
1. **Leverage no-code ML tools** [1,2,3] for empirical validation of research ideas
2. **Develop theoretical or conceptual contributions** that don't require implementation
3. **Conduct human evaluation studies** assessing AI system performance
4. **Build domain expertise** to identify high-impact AI applications
5. **Learn minimal Python** (optional stretch goal) for greater autonomy

**Scientific Contributions:**
- Theoretical papers (proofs, complexity analysis, algorithmic frameworks)
- Empirical studies using no-code tools with rigorous experimental design
- Human evaluation benchmarks and protocols
- Interdisciplinary applications validated through collaboration
- Critical analyses and position papers

**Philosophical Stance:**  
Programming is a **tool**, not a prerequisite for research. Focus on **ideas, rigor, and impact**. Many influential AI researchers collaborate with engineers or use existing tools rather than implementing everything from scratch.

## 2. Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Theoretical Analysis of AI Fairness Metrics**

**Hypothesis:**  
Existing fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration) are mathematically incompatible under certain conditions. A unified theoretical framework can characterize when fairness criteria can be simultaneously satisfied and guide practical tradeoffs.

**Setup:**
- **Approach:** Pure mathematical analysis (no coding required)
  1. Formalize fairness metrics as mathematical constraints
  2. Prove impossibility results (when metrics conflict)
  3. Derive conditions for compatibility (e.g., perfect predictor, specific data distributions)
  4. Develop decision framework for practitioners
- **Tools:** Pen, paper, LaTeX (Overleaf for writing)
- **Validation:** Toy numerical examples (can use Excel, Wolfram Alpha, or ask collaborator to code)

**Baselines:**

  - Logical reasoning (syllogisms, propositional logic)
  - Mathematical reasoning (word problems, proofs)
  - Causal reasoning (counterfactuals, interventions)
  - Common-sense reasoning (physical, social)
- **LLM evaluation:**
  - Use web interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini) – no coding needed

- **Difficulty correlation:** Do LLMs fail on problems humans find hard?
- **Qualitative insights:** Novel failure modes not in literature

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Identify 5–10 systematic failure modes (e.g., "LLMs fail on multi-step counterfactuals")
- Show that LLMs achieve 60–80% accuracy vs. 85–95% for humans on hard reasoning
- Create new evaluation protocol focusing on identified failure modes
- Publish in ACL, EMNLP, or CogSci

**Compute Requirements:**
- **Zero:** Use free LLM web interfaces (ChatGPT free tier, Claude.ai)

## 6. Stretch Ideas or Follow-Up Directions

1. **Learn Python Gradually:**  
   Dedicate 30 minutes/day to Python tutorials. Start with data analysis (Pandas), then visualization (Matplotlib), then basic ML (scikit-learn). Goal: Independence in 6–12 months.

2. **Collaborate with Programmers:**  
   Partner with CS students/researchers. You provide ideas, experimental design, and domain expertise; they handle implementation. Co-author papers.

3. **Develop No-Code Research Toolkit:**  
   Create guides, templates, and workflows for conducting rigorous AI research without coding. Share with community to democratize research.

4. **Human-AI Collaboration Studies:**  
   Investigate how humans and AI systems can collaborate effectively. Design studies, run experiments (no coding), analyze results.

5. **AI Ethics and Policy Research:**  
   Leverage non-technical skills to analyze societal impacts, conduct stakeholder interviews, develop policy recommendations.

6. **Interdisciplinary Applications:**  
   Apply AI to your domain expertise (education, healthcare, law, social science). Identify problems, design solutions, validate through user studies.

7. **Meta-Research on AI:**  
   Analyze trends in AI literature, reproducibility issues, or research practices. Use bibliometric tools (no coding) or manual analysis.

8. **Educational Content Creation:**  
   Write tutorials, blog posts, or create videos explaining AI concepts to non-technical audiences. Build reputation and contribute to community.

9. **Benchmark and Dataset Curation:**  
   Design novel benchmarks or curate high-quality datasets. Requires domain knowledge and careful design, not programming.

10. **Transition to Low-Code Tools:**  
    Explore tools like Jupyter notebooks with pre-written code snippets. Modify parameters without writing code from scratch.

---

## Examples of High-Impact Non-Programming AI Research

1. **Fairness Impossibility Results (Chouldechova, Kleinberg et al.):**  
   Pure mathematical proofs, no implementation required.

2. **ImageNet Dataset (Deng et al., 2009):**  
   Data curation and annotation, minimal coding.

3. **Turing Test and AI Philosophy (Turing, 1950):**  
   Conceptual framework, zero implementation.

4. **Human Evaluation of NLP Systems:**  
   Many ACL/EMNLP papers rely on human studies, not coding.

5. **AI Ethics and Fairness Frameworks:**  
   Conceptual contributions (e.g., Friedman & Nissenbaum on bias in computer systems).

6. **Benchmark Design (GLUE, SuperGLUE):**  
   Task design and curation, implementation by collaborators.

---

## Final Encouragement

**Not knowing Python is a temporary constraint, not a permanent barrier.** Many paths to impactful AI research don't require programming:

- **Theoretical analysis:** Math and logic, no code
- **Experimental design:** Ideas and protocols, implementation by others
- **Human evaluation:** Studies and analysis, minimal coding
- **Domain expertise:** Apply AI to your field, collaborate with engineers
- **Critical analysis:** Literature review and meta-research

**Your unique perspective** (non-CS background, domain expertise, human-centered thinking) is **valuable**. The AI field needs diverse voices, not just more programmers.

**Two strategies:**
1. **No-code path:** Focus on theory, design, and human studies. Use AutoML for validation. Collaborate for implementation.
2. **Learn-as-you-go:** Start with no-code tools, gradually learn Python (30 min/day). In 6 months, you'll have basic skills.

**Either path leads to meaningful research.** Choose based on your interests and timeline.

**Optional next step:**  
Join the "AI Alignment Forum" or "LessWrong" community, where many researchers contribute theoretical and conceptual work without heavy coding. Also explore "Ought" and "Elicit" (AI research assistants) that can help with literature review and analysis without programming. Consider reaching out to professors or labs looking for collaborators with domain expertise or human-centered research skills—many are eager to work with non-programmers who bring complementary strengths.
