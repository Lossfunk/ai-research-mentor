# Turnkey Research Execution Plan: Federated Learning in Low-Resource Countries

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Primary Goal**: Develop and evaluate practical federated learning systems that can operate effectively in low-resource countries with limited computational infrastructure, intermittent connectivity, and heterogeneous devices.

**Key Research Questions**:
- How can federated learning algorithms be adapted for extreme resource constraints typical in developing nations?
- What are the optimal communication protocols for intermittent and low-bandwidth networks?
- How does device heterogeneity (from smartphones to Raspberry Pi devices) affect model convergence and performance?

**Success Metrics**: Achieve comparable model accuracy to centralized approaches while reducing communication overhead by >50% and enabling participation of devices with <2GB RAM and <1Mbps connectivity [P8].

## 2. Experiments

### Experiment 1: Resource-Efficient Algorithm Comparison
**Hypothesis**: Lightweight federated learning approaches will significantly outperform standard FedAvg in resource-constrained environments while maintaining model quality [P9].

**Setup**: Compare FedAvg, single-shot federated learning [P9], and REFT framework [P4] across simulated low-resource conditions.

**Baselines**: Standard FedAvg, centralized training (where feasible), local-only training.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Model accuracy, communication rounds, energy consumption, memory usage, training time.

**Expected Outcomes**: Single-shot and REFT approaches should reduce communication by 80-90% while maintaining 90%+ of centralized accuracy.

### Experiment 2: Real-World Healthcare Deployment
**Hypothesis**: Federated learning can enable collaborative medical AI training across African hospitals without compromising data privacy, replicating and extending the chest imaging work [P7].

**Setup**: Deploy federated tuberculosis detection system across 5-10 hospitals in different countries using chest X-ray data.

**Baselines**: Local hospital models, centralized model (with synthetic data), no-AI baseline.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Diagnostic accuracy, model convergence time, data privacy preservation, system uptime.

**Expected Outcomes**: Federated model should achieve 85%+ sensitivity and specificity while maintaining complete data locality [P3].

### Experiment 3: Multi-Modal Edge Device Study
**Hypothesis**: Heterogeneous device participation (smartphones, tablets, Raspberry Pi) can be optimized through adaptive resource allocation without excluding low-capability devices [P8].

**Setup**: Train image classification models across devices with varying computational capabilities (512MB to 8GB RAM).

**Baselines**: Homogeneous high-resource setup, device-stratified training, capability-based exclusion.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Participation rate, convergence speed, final accuracy, fairness across device types.

**Expected Outcomes**: Adaptive allocation should maintain >80% device participation while achieving within 5% of homogeneous accuracy.
