1. Problem framing and goals
- Problem: Design and evaluate federated learning (FL) methods that remain accurate, fair, and cost-efficient under constraints typical in low-resource countries: intermittent connectivity, very low bandwidth, limited/heterogeneous device compute and energy, and highly non-IID, unbalanced data. Communication overhead and stragglers are primary bottlenecks in cross-device FL; both worsen under poor networks [P1], [P5]. Heterogeneous data and devices degrade convergence and global model quality; personalization can help [P2], [P6].
- Primary goals:
  - Reduce communication and wall-clock time without sacrificing accuracy [P1], [P5].
  - Improve fairness and tail-client performance via personalization under non-IID data [P2], [P6].
  - Achieve robustness to dropouts/stragglers via asynchronous or deadline-aware aggregation [P4], [P5].
  - Measure and reduce energy/monetary costs per trained model round.
  - Maintain privacy with secure aggregation and quantify the utility cost of differential privacy [P6].
- Application scope: Begin with public cross-device FL benchmarks that emulate heterogeneity (LEAF, FedScale) and impose realistic network/energy constraints; later, seek one small real-world pilot (e.g., health or education) if feasible. Note: Field-quality evaluations in low-resource countries are limited; most published evidence is survey-level and simulation-based [P1], [P2], [P5], [P6]. We will explicitly simulate target constraints and, if possible, add a limited pilot to collect authoritative evidence.
- Literature anchors:
  - Kairouz et al., Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning — a canonical reference that frames communication, heterogeneity, privacy, and systems constraints [P6].
  - LEAF and FedScale benchmarks for realistic cross-device FL workloads [1], [2].

2. Experiments
All experiments run on LEAF (FEMNIST, Shakespeare) and FedScale tasks (e.g., StackOverflow, SpeechCommands) with injected constraints: bandwidth caps (64–256 kbps), 30–60% client dropouts, heterogeneous device profiles (CPU-only vs GPU), and energy budgets. We will run three statistically independent trials per condition, report mean ± 95% CI, and release code and configs.

Experiment 1: Communication-efficient FL under low bandwidth
- Hypothesis: Gradient/weight compression plus more local steps can reduce bytes transferred by ≥5× with ≤1–2% absolute accuracy loss vs standard FedAvg in low-bandwidth settings [P3], [P5].
- Setup: Compare FedAvg, FedProx, and SCAFFOLD with communication compression (QSGD, SignSGD, Top-k sparsification) and local steps (FedAvg-L with E∈{1,5,10}). Simulate 64–256 kbps uplink/downlink and 100–400 ms RTT. Datasets: FEMNIST [1], StackOverflow [2].
- Baselines: FedAvg FP32 (no compression), FedOpt-Adam; client sampling at 10% per round with synchronous aggregation [P6].
- Evaluation metrics: Test accuracy; bytes communicated per round and to target accuracy; rounds and wall-clock time to reach 90% of FedAvg accuracy; client participation rate under bandwidth caps.
- Expected outcomes: Compressed updates + modest local steps substantially reduce bytes and time to target accuracy with small accuracy loss; aggressive compression or too many local steps degrade accuracy under highly non-IID data [P3], [P5], [P6].

Experiment 2: Personalization for non-IID and fairness
- Hypothesis: Personalized FL (Per-FedAvg, pFedMe, FedBN) improves the 10th-percentile client accuracy and calibration vs a single global model under non-IID splits [P2], [P6].
- Setup: Non-IID splits by client (e.g., writer- or user-based partitioning). Compare global FedAvg/FedProx vs Per-FedAvg, pFedMe, and FedBN. Keep communication budget equal across methods.
- Baselines: FedAvg global model; local-only training (no FL) as a reference upper bound for personalization.
- Evaluation metrics: Overall accuracy; client-wise accuracy distribution (10th/50th/90th percentiles); ECE calibration; fairness gap (max-min client accuracy); bytes to target fairness.
- Expected outcomes: Personalized methods close the tail-client gap by several percentage points with small extra computation, especially when client data distributions are skewed [P2], [P6].

Experiment 3: Straggler/dropout robustness via asynchronous or deadline-aware FL
- Hypothesis: Asynchronous or deadline-based partial aggregation reduces wall-clock time to target accuracy by ≥25% with ≤1% accuracy loss vs synchronous FedAvg under 40–60% dropouts [P4], [P5].
- Setup: Implement synchronous FedAvg with (a) random client sampling and (b) deadline-based early aggregation; compare to an asynchronous server (e.g., FedAsync-style) with staleness-aware weighting. Inject intermittent connectivity and variable compute speeds.
- Baselines: Synchronous FedAvg with fixed round timeouts.
- Evaluation metrics: Wall-clock time and rounds to target accuracy; staleness distribution; robustness to correlated dropouts; final accuracy.
- Expected outcomes: Deadline-aware and asynchronous variants reach target accuracy faster and tolerate higher dropout rates at small or moderate accuracy cost [P4], [P5].

Experiment 4: Energy- and cost-aware client selection
- Hypothesis: Selecting clients by marginal utility per joule (or per dollar of data) reduces energy by ≥30% at comparable accuracy vs random sampling [P1], [P5].
- Setup: Measure device energy during local training and transmission (Android Battery Historian or Monsoon Power Monitor) to build simple per-client energy models. Compare random vs energy-aware sampling (maximize expected gradient diversity per joule).
- Baselines: Random client sampling; uniform participation.
- Evaluation metrics: Joules and monetary data cost per round and to target accuracy; accuracy; fairness across low- vs high-end devices.
- Expected outcomes: Energy-aware sampling cuts energy and data costs with negligible accuracy change; may slightly increase fairness gaps if not combined with fairness constraints [P1], [P5]. We will include a fairness-regularized variant.

Experiment 5: Privacy-utility trade-offs (DP + secure aggregation)
- Hypothesis: With secure aggregation and user-level DP-SGD, epsilon in [3–8] yields <2–4% absolute accuracy drop vs no DP on these tasks, with additional runtime/communication overhead [P6].
- Setup: Implement secure aggregation at the server; add user-level DP-SGD noise accounting and clipping. Sweep noise multipliers and participation rates at fixed communication budgets.
- Baselines: No-DP secure aggregation; pure FedAvg.
- Evaluation metrics: Utility (accuracy), privacy (ε under standard accounting), runtime, bytes; degradation across tail clients.
- Expected outcomes: DP reduces accuracy more under highly non-IID and small client participation; secure aggregation adds modest overhead but preserves utility [P6].

5. Risks and mitigations table
- Risk: Simulations may not reflect real low-resource networks; results overfit to emulator settings.
  - Mitigation: Calibrate emulator with measurements from at least 5–10 real devices on varied networks; include a small real-device evaluation subset in each experiment; report sensitivity analyses [P4], [P5].
- Risk: Non-IID severity is mis-specified, biasing personalization results.
  - Mitigation: Use multiple non-IID generators and real partitions from LEAF/FedScale; report results across severities [1], [2], [P2].
- Risk: Energy measurements noisy or device-specific.
  - Mitigation: Repeat measurements, normalize by task, and build simple per-device energy models with uncertainty, then test robustness to model error.
- Risk: Communication compression harms convergence on some tasks.
  - Mitigation: Pair compression with optimizer variants (FedOpt), error-feedback, and tune local steps; early-stop on divergence [P3], [P5].
- Risk: Asynchronous training destabilizes convergence.
  - Mitigation: Use staleness-aware weighting and bounded delay; hybrid deadline-based partial aggregation [P4], [P5].
- Risk: Privacy mechanisms degrade utility more than expected.
  - Mitigation: Tune clipping/participation; adopt personalization to recover tail performance; clearly report ε-utility curves [P6].
- Risk: Security/poisoning attacks.
  - Mitigation: Use secure aggregation; add robust aggregation (trimmed mean, median) in ablations; monitor update anomalies [P6].
- Risk: Reproducibility gaps.
  - Mitigation: Release full configs, seeds, hardware specs, and Docker images; run 3+ trials with CIs.

6. Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Hierarchical FL with community/edge micro-servers to reduce WAN hops and enable store-and-forward during outages [P4].
- Incentive-aware client selection (e.g., airtime credits), balancing fairness and energy/cost budgets.
- Joint model compression and personalization (knowledge distillation during personalization rounds) to cut both on-device compute and communication [P3], [P6].
- Fairness-aware objectives (e.g., group-DRO-style losses) for underserved client groups.
- Semi-supervised FL to leverage abundant unlabeled on-device data with minimal labels.
