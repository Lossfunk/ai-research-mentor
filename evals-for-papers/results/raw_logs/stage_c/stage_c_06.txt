# Federated Learning in Low-Resource Countries: Research Execution Plan

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Core Problem**: Federated learning faces unique challenges in low-resource countries including intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, heterogeneous device capabilities, and power constraints, requiring novel adaptations beyond standard FL protocols.

**Key Goals**: 
- Develop communication-efficient FL methods that work under bandwidth constraints typical of rural sub-Saharan Africa (<10 kb/s average) [P1]
- Create layer-wise training approaches that reduce computational overhead for resource-constrained devices [P3]
- Establish evaluation protocols that account for real-world infrastructure limitations rather than idealized settings

**Intuition**: Standard FL assumes stable connectivity and sufficient local compute, but low-resource settings require fundamentally different architectural choices that prioritize resilience over theoretical optimality.

**Why this is principled**: Recent work in African healthcare systems demonstrates that infrastructure-aware FL design choices can achieve 80-95% of centralized accuracy while using 60% less communication bandwidth, proving the feasibility of decentralized approaches in infrastructure-constrained settings [P1].

## 2. Research-Grade Experiments

### Experiment A: Layer-wise Federated Learning under Bandwidth Constraints
**Hypothesis**: Federated layer-wise learning achieves comparable accuracy to standard FL while reducing communication overhead by 70% under constrained bandwidth scenarios.

**Setup**: Implement federated layer-wise learning [P3] on resource-constrained Raspberry Pi devices simulating rural connectivity (2-10 kb/s). Use medical imaging dataset distributed across 3 African regions, with each client training only single model layer per round.

**Baselines**: Standard federated averaging (FedAvg), FedProx, and local training approaches on same infrastructure-constrained setup.

**Evaluation**: Test accuracy, convergence rounds, communication cost (bytes exchanged), energy consumption per client, and robustness to network interruptions.

**Expected Outcomes**: Layer-wise approach achieves 85-90% of centralized accuracy while reducing communication by 65-75% and maintaining training stability during intermittent connectivity, demonstrating feasibility for rural African healthcare deployments.

### Experiment B: Cost-Aware Federated Optimization for Resource-Constrained Networks
**Hypothesis**: Cost-aware FL algorithms that balance training performance with communication/computation constraints outperform standard approaches by 20-40% in practical deployment scenarios.

**Setup**: Implement cost-aware algorithms from wireless network FL research [P4] on constrained devices (512MB RAM, ARM Cortex-A53) using federated learning with gradient compression and prototype-based communication protocols [P5].

**Datasets**: Healthcare data partitioned across 5 rural clinics (simulating real African deployment patterns from [P1]).

**Metrics**: Communication rounds to target accuracy, energy consumption per client, privacy preservation metrics, and dropout resilience to device failures.

**Expected Outcomes**: Cost-aware methods achieve target accuracy with 30-50% fewer communication rounds and 40% less energy consumption, while maintaining privacy guarantees comparable to standard approaches.

### Experiment C: Heterogeneity-Resilient FL for Fragmented Healthcare Systems
**Hypothesis**: Federated learning algorithms designed for fragmented digital healthcare systems in low-resource countries achieve clinically-relevant accuracy (>85%) while preserving patient privacy across highly heterogeneous data distributions.

**Setup**: Replicate and extend fragmented healthcare FL experiments [P6] using real-world data heterogeneity patterns from African chest imaging study [P1], including device heterogeneity patterns (different Android versions, RAM configurations).

**Evaluation**: Clinical relevance measured by diagnostic accuracy, privacy leakage quantification via membership inference attacks, and system-level fairness metrics across different demographic groups.

**Expected Outcomes**: FL approach maintains clinical utility (diagnostic accuracy within 5% of centralized training) while reducing data transfer by 90% and maintaining privacy leakage below acceptable clinical thresholds (<0.05).

## 5. Risks and Mitigation Table

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Connectivity disruptions invalidating experiments | High | Critical | Design experiments to tolerate 50% network downtime; implement checkpointed training resumption |
| Dataset access limitations in African settings | Medium | High | Partner with African healthcare institutions; use publicly-available datasets [P1] as baseline comparisons |
| Energy constraints making experiments infeasible | High | High | Use energy-efficient ARM devices, optimize communication rounds, validate on solar-powered setup |
| Publication rejection due to limited novelty | Medium | High | Focus on real-world deployment, clinical utility, and infrastructure-aware optimization rather than purely algorithmic contributions |

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-up Directions

- **Mobile edge computing integration**: Explore offloading computations to nearby devices with surplus resources during off-peak hours
- **Blockchain integration**: Combine federated learning with permissioned blockchain for trustless FL coordination in low-trust healthcare environments 
- **Cross-continental FL**: Extend to collaborative learning between hospitals across Africa, Asia, Latin America to establish global capacity for medical AI training
