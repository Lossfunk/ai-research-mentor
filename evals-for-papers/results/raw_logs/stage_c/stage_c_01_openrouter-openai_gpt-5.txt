Below is a concise, evidence-based research plan to develop, evaluate, and iterate graph neural networks (GNNs) for sea-ice forecasting and analysis. It is organized to enable stepwise progress and clear comparisons to baselines, with specific, falsifiable experiments.

Scope and objectives
- Core targets
  - Grid-scale: predict sea-ice concentration and ice edge position at 3–30 day lead times, following recent GNN studies on sub-seasonal sea ice in Hudson Bay [1][2].
  - Drift/velocity: predict sea-ice motion vectors at daily to sub-weekly scales, conditioning on wind/ocean drivers (conjecture).
  - Floe-scale: model floe–floe interactions and collisions from SAR-derived floe graphs [3][4][5].
- Design principles
  - Leverage spatio-temporal GNNs that pass messages on geodesic or unstructured meshes (inspired by GraphCast-style graph weather modeling) [7][8].
  - Enforce physically motivated constraints (e.g., area/volume conservation) via losses or architecture choices, as demonstrated for Arctic sea ice and polar ice layers [6][9].

Data and graph construction
- Regions and horizons
  - Start in Hudson Bay (a well-studied, semi-enclosed basin) for 7–30 day forecasts, then extend to pan-Arctic/Antarctic (conjecture). The Hudson Bay focus is supported by recent GNN work [1][2].
- Inputs/targets
  - Inputs: recent sea-ice fields and atmospheric drivers (e.g., wind, air temperature, pressure), plus optional ocean currents (conjecture).
  - Targets: sea-ice concentration (SIC), derived ice edge, drift vectors; optional thickness where available (conjecture).
- Graphs
  - Grid-level graph: nodes are grid cells; edges from geodesic adjacency or k-NN in space; temporal edges via recurrent dynamics (GraphCast-like spatial graphs) [7][8].
  - Floe-level graph: nodes are segmented floes from SAR or optical imagery; edges by Delaunay/k-NN proximity and predicted contacts; supports collision dynamics [3][4][5].

Models
- Tier A: Grid-level spatio-temporal GNN for SIC/edge
  - Candidates: ST-GCN/GAT variants with temporal attention; residual message passing; autoregressive rollout (supported conceptually by [1][2][7]).
- Tier B: Physics-informed, multi-scale GNN
  - Multi-resolution graph (coarse↔fine) with conservation-aware losses for SIC/volume, following conservation-law-aware designs in IceGAT [6] and physics-informed GNNs for polar ice layers [9].
- Tier C: Floe-interaction GNN
  - Particle/message-passing GNN to predict floe trajectories and collision outcomes from dynamic floe graphs, building on GNNs for colliding particles applied to sea-ice floes [3] and using floe-tracking tools [4].

Training and evaluation
- Baselines
  - Persistence/climatology; ConvLSTM/U-Net on grids; simple optical-flow for drift (conjecture).
- Metrics
  - SIC/edge: RMSE/MAE for SIC; edge distance error and probabilistic skill at the ice edge (conjecture).
  - Drift: vector RMSE, angular error (conjecture).
  - Floes: trajectory MSE, collision F1/precision–recall [3].
- Validation
  - Out-of-time and out-of-region tests (Hudson Bay → Beaufort/Antarctic), stress tests during extreme weather (conjecture).
  - Long-horizon stability checks (error growth vs. lead time) and conservation diagnostics (area/volume budgets) [6][9].

Milestones
- M1: Reproduce a Hudson Bay sub-seasonal GNN baseline for SIC/edge (≤3 months) [1][2].
- M2: Add physics-informed conservation losses; quantify long-horizon stability gains (≤6 months) [6][9].
- M3: Build a floe-level pipeline from SAR segmentation to dynamic graphs and a collision GNN (≤9–12 months) [
