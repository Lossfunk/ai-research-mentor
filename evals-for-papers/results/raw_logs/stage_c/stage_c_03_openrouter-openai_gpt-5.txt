1. Problem framing and goals
- Reality check and objective: “Curing cancer tomorrow” is not feasible; however, within 6 months, you can deliver measurable, evidence-backed improvements at key points of the cancer pathway where AI already shows clinical benefit: screening/early detection, endoscopic polyp detection, and faster treatment selection via pathology-based biomarkers. The plan below targets near-term, clinically meaningful outcomes with pragmatic trials and rigorous retrospective validations.
- Primary goals (6-month horizon):
  - Reduce radiologist workload and maintain or improve breast cancer detection in screening by deploying AI-assisted reading, following randomized-trial evidence [1,2].
  - Increase adenoma detection during colonoscopy using FDA-cleared computer-aided detection (CADe), which randomized and real-world studies show can raise detection rates—a direct proxy for colorectal cancer prevention [3,4].
  - Accelerate immunotherapy triage by predicting microsatellite instability (MSI) directly from H&E slides to prioritize confirmatory testing and reduce time-to-treatment, building on validated deep learning results in GI cancers [5].
- Success criteria:
  - Screening: Non-inferior or better cancer detection rate (CDR) with reduced workload vs. standard double-reading; stable recall rates [1,2].
  - Colonoscopy: Statistically significant increase in adenoma detection rate (ADR) without prolonging withdrawal time or increasing adverse events [3,4].
  - Pathology biomarker triage: High AUC for MSI prediction and reduction in median time-to-immunotherapy initiation in a prospective pilot (process outcome).

2. Experiments
Experiment 1: AI-assisted breast screening (paired-reader, non-inferiority, pragmatic)
- Hypothesis: Single-reader + AI triage will be non-inferior to standard double-reading for CDR, with reduced workload and similar or lower recall rates, consistent with the MASAI randomized trial [1,2].
- Setup:
  - Population: Consecutive screening mammograms at one to two sites for 3 months.
  - Intervention: AI-assisted reading where AI flags cases for second review; low-risk exams finalized by a single reader.
  - Design: Paired-reader, non-inferiority; pre-specify non-inferiority margins mirroring MASAI (e.g., −10% relative CDR margin).
  - Data capture: Cancer outcomes confirmed via standard diagnostic follow-up; workload measured as number of human reads per exam and time per exam.
- Baselines: Historical double-reading performance; contemporaneous double-read subset.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Primary: Cancer detection rate (per 1000 screens), recall rate, interval cancer rate (if available), reading workload.
  - Secondary: Positive predictive value (PPV1), time-to-result, patient callbacks.
- Expected outcomes: Non-inferior CDR with 30–40% reader workload reduction and stable recall, aligning with MASAI trial findings [1,2].

Experiment 2: AI CADe for colonoscopy (randomized, parallel-group)
- Hypothesis: Real-time CADe increases ADR and polyp detection without clinically meaningful increases in withdrawal time, consistent with randomized/meta-analytic evidence [3,4].
- Setup:
  - Population: Average-risk screening colonoscopies; randomized 1:1 to CADe-on vs CADe-off.
  - Intervention: GI Genius or equivalent CADe integrated into endoscopy suite.
  - Design: Randomized pragmatic trial with endoscopist stratification.
  - Safety: Monitor perforations, post-polypectomy bleeding; collect Boston Bowel Preparation Scale.
- Baselines: CADe-off arm (standard practice).
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Primary: Adenoma detection rate (proportion with ≥1 adenoma).
  - Secondary: Mean adenomas per colonoscopy, sessile serrated lesion detection, withdrawal time, adverse events.
- Expected outcomes: Absolute ADR increase of ~5–10 percentage points vs. control, in line with RCTs and real-world studies; no clinically significant increase in adverse events [3,4].

Experiment 3: Pathology AI for MSI triage to speed immunotherapy decisions (retrospective → prospective pilot)
- Hypothesis: A validated H&E-based MSI predictor achieves high AUC and reduces median time-to-treatment by prioritizing confirmatory MSI testing for likely-positive cases, building on Nature Medicine evidence [5].
- Setup:
  - Phase 1 (retrospective): Train/validate on local colorectal and gastric cancer WSIs; external validation on a held-out site.
  - Phase 2 (prospective feasibility): Silent-mode inference to trigger expedited MSI PCR/IHC for high-probability cases; measure time-to-result and time-to-immunotherapy initiation.
  - Governance: IRB and pathology QA oversight; no treatment decisions from AI without confirmation.
- Baselines: Standard pathology workflow without AI triage.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Retrospective: AUC, sensitivity/specificity at operating points matching lab throughput; calibration.
  - Prospective: Time from biopsy to confirmed MSI result; time to first immunotherapy; rate of unnecessary expedited tests.
- Expected outcomes: AUC ≥0.85 for MSI; ≥20–30% reduction in median time-to-MSI result for high-probability cases without excess unnecessary tests [5].

Experiment 4: Integrated care-path analytics and early harm monitoring (observational)
- Hypothesis: A centralized analytics layer detecting data drift, equity gaps, and false-positive burdens will reduce unintended harms and support safe scale-up across sites.
- Setup:
  - Build dashboards for subgroup performance (age, sex, ethnicity, site), drift detection (population, device), and workload.
  - Predefine action thresholds (e.g., recall rate spikes >2 SD above baseline).
- Baselines: Historical variability and existing QA processes.
- Evaluation metrics: Time to drift detection; number of remedial actions; stability of key metrics post-intervention.
- Expected outcomes: Early identification and mitigation of degradations, enabling safe expansion of Experiments 1–3.

5. Risks and mitigations table
- Regulatory and IRB delays
  - Mitigation: Parallelize site onboarding; use silent-mode starts; reuse prior IRB templates; focus initial work on QA and process outcomes.
- Generalization gaps (site, device, subgroups)
  - Mitigation: External validation sets; subgroup monitoring; device-specific calibration; predefined rollback criteria.
- Reader/endoscopist adoption variability
  - Mitigation: Training, clear UI, opt-out during ambiguity; monitor workload and satisfaction; incorporate clinician feedback loops.
- Overdiagnosis/false positives and increased callbacks
  - Mitigation: Pre-specify recall caps; human-in-the-loop arbitration; regular PPV audits.
- MSI model clinical utility risk (AUC does not translate to faster treatment)
  - Mitigation: Limit to triage with confirmatory testing; track time-to-result and net benefit; stop if unnecessary expedited tests exceed threshold.
- Data quality and drift (scanner settings, bowel prep quality)
  - Mitigation: QC pipelines; BBPS documentation; continuous calibration; periodic re-training windows.
- Security and privacy
  - Mitigation: On-prem compute; de-identification; audit trails; access controls; vendor BAAs.

6. Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Radiation oncology: Auto-contouring + on-table QA with randomized workflow study to reduce planning times; explore adaptive radiotherapy triggers.
- Trial matching: NLP-based eligibility extraction with pragmatic trial to test increased enrollment speed in rare cancers.
- Multimodal foundation model: Combine pathology, radiology, genomics, and notes for treatment response prediction; begin with retrospective benchmarks, target prospective observational study after 6 months.
- Patient navigation: LLM-based communication aids to reduce no-shows and time-to-biopsy with A/B testing and safety guardrails.

Inline evidence notes
- The feasibility and benefit of AI-supported mammography screening are supported by a randomized non-inferiority trial [1] and a prospective-evidence commentary [2].  
- The efficacy of CADe for colonoscopy to improve adenoma detection is supported by RCT syntheses and real-world evidence [3,4].  
- MSI prediction from H&E slides has been demonstrated in peer-reviewed work; we propose a cautious triage role with confirmatory testing [5].
