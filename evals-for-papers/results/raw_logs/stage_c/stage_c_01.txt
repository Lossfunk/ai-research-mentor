1) Problem framing and goals
- Objective: Develop and evaluate spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) for pan-Arctic sea-ice prediction tasks that benefit from graph structure: (a) sea-ice concentration (SIC) nowcasting (1–7 days), (b) sea-ice drift forecasting (1–3 days), and (c) weekly sea-ice thickness (SIT) nowcasting with physics-informed constraints. Focus on rigorous baselines, scale-aware metrics, and reproducibility.
- Why GNNs: GNNs natively operate on irregular or multi-resolution meshes and can encode conservation and neighborhood interactions, which aligns with sea-ice dynamics. Recent work has shown multi-scale graph modeling with conservation constraints improves Arctic sea-ice prediction [Arctic Sea Ice Prediction Based on Multi-Scale Graph Modeling With Conservation Laws] [5]. Graph-based weather forecasting (GraphCast) demonstrates strong performance on geodesic grids for spatiotemporal dynamics [4].
- Datasets and scope:
  - SIC: EUMETSAT OSI-SAF global sea-ice concentration reprocessing/NRT products [8].
  - Drift: OSI-SAF sea-ice drift vectors; note known motion-dataset artifacts requiring careful validation [7, 9].
  - SIT: CryoSat-2/SMOS merged weekly thickness (AWI/ESA/CMEMS) [10–12].
  - Auxiliary drivers: 10 m winds, MSLP, SST from reanalyses (e.g., ERA5).
- Deliverables: Open, reproducible code; standardized splits (by year/season); ablations on graph construction and physics constraints; uncertainty estimates; and thorough error analysis across spatial scales and seasons.

Note on evidence: A general tool query returned off-topic results; we therefore used targeted literature/data searches yielding sea-ice GNN work (IceGAT/JGR) and authoritative datasets (OSI-SAF, CryoSat-2/SMOS) [4–12]. For a broader survey, we would expand with domain-specific queries combining “graph neural network” + “sea ice” + task terms (e.g., “drift”, “thickness”, “nowcasting”) and dataset names (OSI-SAF, CryoSat-2/SMOS, RGPS) across arXiv/AGU/The Cryosphere.

2) Experiments
Experiment 1 — SIC nowcasting (1–7 days) with multi-scale spatiotemporal GNN
- Hypothesis: A multi-scale GNN on a geodesic or native OSI-SAF grid, augmented with mass-conservation regularization, reduces SIC RMSE and improves edge/lead preservation relative to CNN/ConvLSTM baselines, especially at synoptic scales [5, 8, 4].
- Setup:
  - Data: OSI-SAF SIC daily; ERA5 winds/MSLP/SST as exogenous inputs; train 2012–2021, val 2022, test 2023–2024 [8].
  - Graphs: (a) fixed icosahedral mesh (resolution ~25 km) with k-NN geodesic edges; (b) native OSI-SAF grid with 8-neighbor connectivity; multi-scale via pooling/unpooling across 2–3 resolutions.
  - Model: Spatiotemporal GNN (GAT/DCRNN-style encoder-decoder); residual physics layer implementing a continuity-like penalty: minimize mismatch between predicted ∂A/∂t and −∇·(A u) given winds/drift proxies (learned u or reanalysis-driven), following conservation-motivated approaches [5].
  - Training: MSE + gradient loss (to preserve sharp edges) + conservation penalty; seasonal curriculum (separate heads or conditioning by month).
- Baselines:
  - Persistence and climatology; optical-flow advection of SIC; U-Net/ConvLSTM; a transformer or GraphCast-style baseline (graph on fixed mesh) [4].
- Evaluation metrics:
  - RMSE/MAE; anomaly correlation; spatial power-spectrum error (wavenumber-binned RMSE) to capture multi-scale fidelity; sea-ice edge F1; seasonal breakdown (summer vs winter).
- Expected outcomes:
  - GNN with physics penalty reduces RMSE and improves edge F1 over CNN/ConvLSTM by exploiting graph structure and conservation priors [5, 4]. If gains are small in summer (surface melt), analyze scale-dependent errors and input-driver sensitivity.

Experiment 2 — Sea-ice drift forecasting (24–72 h) with kinematics-aware GNN
- Hypothesis: A message-passing GNN over the SIC grid using winds/MSLP and recent drift produces lower endpoint error and better deformation (divergence/shear) skill than advection and optical-flow baselines, provided motion-product artifacts are addressed [7, 9].
- Setup:
  - Data: OSI-SAF medium-resolution drift (20–50 km, daily or multi-day) with collocated SIC and ERA5 winds/MSLP; 2012–2021 train, 2022 val, 2023–2024 test [9, 8].
  - Graph: Grid-neighbor edges plus dynamic edges weighted by wind alignment; optional temporal edges (TGN).
  - Model: Vector-field GNN head predicting u,v; optional Helmholtz decomposition regularizer (curl/div penalties).
  - Loss: Endpoint error + spectral loss on u,v; deformation-term loss to stabilize divergence/shear.
- Baselines:
  - Zero-motion persistence; linear advection from winds; optical flow (Farnebäck/RAFT) on SIC; ConvLSTM regression of u,v.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Endpoint error (km/day); vector RMSE; divergence/shear RMSE; area-weighted metrics; spectral error; regional subsets (Beaufort, central Arctic).
- Expected outcomes:
  - GNN reduces endpoint error and better reproduces deformation patterns vs baselines, but sensitivity analysis is needed due to known artifacts and sampling issues in motion datasets [7, 9].

Experiment 3 — Weekly SIT nowcasting with physics-informed GNN
- Hypothesis: A physics-informed GNN leveraging thickness tendencies and mass-conservation-like constraints improves SIT RMSE vs purely data-driven models, particularly during growth season, when constrained by CryoSat-2/SMOS weekly products [10–12, 5].
- Setup:
  - Data: CryoSat-2/SMOS merged weekly SIT; OSI-SAF SIC; ERA5 thermodynamic proxies (2 m temperature, turbulent fluxes) [10–12, 8].
  - Graph: Co-registered to SIT grid; multi-scale pooling to capture basin-scale propagation.
  - Model: Encoder-decoder ST-GNN with explicit tendency head predicting Δh; constraint term encourages mass-conserving evolution tied to SIC and drift (when available). Seasonal regime conditioning.
- Baselines:
  - Persistence; linear trend; U-Net/ConvLSTM on gridded SIT; climatology.
- Evaluation metrics:
  - RMSE/MAE; bias; regional skill (first-year vs multi-year ice zones); scale-resolved errors; uncertainty calibration (ensembles).
- Expected outcomes:
  - Reduced RMSE and better calibration in winter/early spring; limited gains in summer due to retrieval uncertainties—documented via seasonal breakdown and uncertainty analysis [10–12].

Ablations common to all experiments
- Graph construction: native grid vs icosahedral; k-NN radius; dynamic vs static edge weights.
- Message passing: GAT vs GraphSAGE vs diffusion-convolution (DCRNN).
- Physics losses: weight sweeps; removal tests to quantify contribution [5].
- Exogenous forcing: with/without winds/MSLP/SST.
- Train-test splits: random vs year-wise to avoid leakage; seasonal-only models.
- Robustness: sensor-gap simulation; motion-product noise injection as per known artifacts [7].

5) Risks and mitigations
- Risk: Motion dataset artifacts bias drift training/evaluation [7].
  - Mitigation: Cross-validate with alternative drift sources; mask low-confidence vectors; evaluate deformation statistics; robustness tests with noise-injected labels.
- Risk: Seasonal leakage inflates skill.
  - Mitigation: Year-wise splits; seasonal-only models; report season-specific metrics and train/test year tables.
- Risk: Physics constraints destabilize training.
  - Mitigation: Curriculum on loss weights; gradient clipping; start with weak penalties and anneal; ablations quantifying effect [5].
- Risk: Multi-sensor co-registration errors.
  - Mitigation: Careful remapping to a common grid with conservative interpolation; QC by visual and statistical diagnostics.
- Risk: Limited SIT summer reliability [10–12].
  - Mitigation: Downweight or mask low-confidence summer retrievals; emphasize winter/spring evaluation; calibrate uncertainty.
- Risk: Overfitting to regions or regimes.
  - Mitigation: Region-stratified validation (Beaufort, Laptev, central Arctic); spatial cross-validation; report regional metrics.
- Risk: Compute/time overruns.
  - Mitigation: Start with lower-resolution meshes and smaller windows; adopt early stopping; prioritize ablations with highest expected insight.

6) Stretch ideas or follow-up directions
- Multi-task GNN: Jointly predict SIC, drift, and SIT with shared encoders and task-specific heads; test whether shared structure improves consistency.
- Floe/lead graphs from SAR: Build object-level graphs (nodes=floes/leads; edges=contacts) for tracking and deformation; evaluate on curated SAR subsets (requires labeling or weak supervision). Use The Cryosphere lead/ridge statistics for validation [6].
- Hybrid ML–physics: Couple GNN tendencies with a thermodynamic column model; enforce energy/mass budgets explicitly.
- Uncertainty/ensembles: Deep ensembles and conformal prediction for calibrated spatiotemporal uncertainty.
- Scale-aware training: Spectral losses and multi-resolution supervision to target mesoscale/pack-scale dynamics [4, 5].

Optional next step
- Stand up the data pipeline for OSI-SAF SIC/drift and CryoSat-2/SMOS SIT with a fixed 2012–2024 split, and replicate two simple baselines (persistence and U-Net) within two weeks; this derisks the rest of the plan.
