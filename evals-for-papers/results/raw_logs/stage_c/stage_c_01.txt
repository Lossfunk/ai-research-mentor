# GNNs for Sea Ice: Research Execution Plan

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Core Problem**: Current sea ice prediction models struggle to capture fine-scale spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in Arctic/Antarctic regions, limiting accuracy for shipping, climate research, and coastal planning.

**Innovation**: Graph Neural Networks can model sea ice as interconnected spatial-temporal systems, where each grid cell is a node with connections based on geographical proximity, ocean currents, and atmospheric patterns.

**Contributions**:
1. Develop specialized GNN architectures for sea ice temporal-spatial modeling
2. Create graph construction methods that incorporate remote sensing data (SAR, optical, thermal)
3. Validate on multi-year satellite datasets across both poles
4. Achieve publication in Remote Sensing-focused journals

## 2. Experiments

**Experiment 1: Graph Construction Validation**
*Hypothesis*: Nodes connected via ocean current distance will outperform Euclidean distance connections for sea ice prediction (30% lower MAE).
*Setup*: Construct graphs using: (a) Euclidean distance, (b) ocean current-informed distance, (c) atmospheric forcing proximity, (d) combined approach. Use Sentinel-1 SAR data and AMSR2 passive microwave data as node features.
*Baselines*: Standard CNN on raster data, vanilla GCN [P3]
*Evaluation*: 5-fold temporal cross-validation, MAE on sea ice concentration (%), temporal consistency across seasons
*Expected Outcomes*: Ocean-current-based graph construction improves prediction accuracy by 15-25% over Euclidean distance

**Experiment 2: Multi-modal GNN Architecture**
*Hypothesis*: Multi-branch GNN processing SAR+optical+thermal data through separate encoders then fusion via graph attention will achieve SOTA performance on sea ice thickness prediction (correlation >0.85 with in-situ data).
*Setup*: Implement three-branch GNN: SAR branch (XGBoostNet for speckle), optical branch (ResNet), thermal branch (custom CNN), each feeding into graph nodes. Compare against single-modality baselines.
*Baselines*: Single-modality GNNs, CNN on stacked data, multi-branch CNN without graph structure
*Evaluation*: RMSE on sea ice thickness (cm), spatial resolution assessment, pan-Arctic evaluation
*Expected Outcomes*: Multi-modal GNN with graph attention achieves 15% better correlation than CNN baseline [P6]

**Experiment 3: Spatio-temporal Graph Architecture Comparison**
*Hypothesis*: Temporal graph convolution networks will outperform static approaches for 7-day sea ice prediction (forecast horizon test)
*Setup*: Compare TGAT, EvolveGCN, and custom spatio-temporal architecture on 10-year sea ice data time series
*Baselines*: LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA on single-region data
*Evaluation*: Classification accuracy on binary ice/water separation, ROC AUC
*Expected Outcomes*: 20% improvement in ROC AUC over traditional time-series methods [P1]

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Limited labeled training data | High | Semi-supervised learning, transfer learning using pre-trained models on related climate tasks, synthetic data augmentation via physics-based modeling |
| Computational overhead for large graphs | Medium | Graph sampling strategies, subgraph-based training, distributed training across GPUs |
| Seasonal distribution shift due climate warming | High | Temporal validation using sliding windows, domain adaptation across climate epochs, evaluation on held-out recent data |
| Inconsistent satellite coverage at poles | Medium | Multi-sensor fusion (SAR + optical + passive microwave), data imputation using graph-based techniques |

## 6. Stretch Ideas or Follow-up Directions

*Multi-modal multi-task learning*: Jointly predict sea ice, ocean temperature, and atmospheric variables using shared representations
*Uncertainty quantification*: Implement Bayesian GNN frameworks for prediction confidence intervals
*Real-time prediction*: Adapt approaches for near-real-time operational forecasting
*Application to other polar phenomena*: Extend to permafrost thaw, glacier mass balance, iceberg tracking

## Intuition
Sea ice exhibits natural graph-like properties - it forms continuous sheets with strong spatial correlations, and its evolution depends on both local atmospheric/oceanic conditions and regional circulation patterns. GNNs can explicitly model these relationships, capturing how ice conditions at one location influence neighboring areas through complex ocean-atmosphere feedbacks.

## Why This Is Principled
This approach aligns with recent successes of graph methods in climate science for modeling spatial-temporal processes. It builds on proven atmospheric data assimilation techniques but extends them to handle non-Euclidean spatial relationships. The multi-modal aspect addresses a fundamental limitation of single-sensor approaches in polar regions where cloud cover, darkness, and surface conditions affect different sensors differently [P6][P1].
