# Research Execution Plan: Graph Neural Networks for Sea Ice Modeling

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Primary Goal**: Develop graph neural network architectures to model sea ice dynamics, concentration, and extent prediction in Arctic regions, leveraging the spatial relationships and temporal dependencies inherent in sea ice systems.

**Key Research Questions**:
- Can GNNs capture the complex spatial dependencies in sea ice formation and melting better than traditional CNNs or RNNs?
- How do different graph construction strategies (spatial proximity, physical connectivity, climate similarity) affect prediction accuracy?
- What temporal horizons can GNNs reliably predict for sea ice concentration and extent?

**Success Metrics**:
- Improved prediction accuracy over existing CNN/RNN baselines for 1-30 day forecasts
- Better representation of spatial correlations in sea ice dynamics
- Physically interpretable learned representations

## 2. Experiments

**Experiment 1: Spatial Graph Construction Comparison**
- **Hypothesis**: Different graph construction methods will capture distinct aspects of sea ice physics, with hybrid approaches outperforming single-strategy graphs
- **Setup**: Compare k-nearest neighbor, Delaunay triangulation, and physics-informed connectivity (ocean currents, wind patterns) for Arctic grid cells
- **Baselines**: CNN-LSTM models, traditional numerical sea ice models (CICE), persistence forecasts
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, spatial correlation coefficients, ice edge accuracy
- **Expected Outcome**: Physics-informed graphs should outperform purely geometric approaches, especially for longer forecasts

**Experiment 2: Multi-scale Temporal GNN Architecture**
- **Hypothesis**: Hierarchical temporal attention in GNNs will improve long-term sea ice prediction by capturing both daily variations and seasonal trends
- **Setup**: Implement multi-scale GNN with attention mechanisms operating at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales
- **Baselines**: Single-scale GNNs, hierarchical CNN approaches from climate modeling literature [P3]
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Forecast skill scores, temporal correlation preservation, seasonal cycle accuracy
- **Expected Outcome**: Multi-scale approach should maintain accuracy for 15-30 day forecasts where single-scale models degrade

**Experiment 3: Physics-Informed GNN Constraints**
- **Hypothesis**: Incorporating physical constraints (energy conservation, mass balance) will improve model robustness and generalization, following principles from physics-informed neural networks [P2]
- **Setup**: Add physics-based loss terms for energy conservation and ice mass balance to standard GNN training
- **Baselines**: Unconstrained GNNs, physics-informed CNNs
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Physical consistency metrics, out-of-distribution performance, extreme event prediction
- **Expected Outcome**: Physics-informed models should show better generalization to unseen climate conditions and extreme events
