# Research Execution Plan: Graph Neural Networks for Sea Ice Analysis

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Primary Research Question**: How can Graph Neural Networks effectively model the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of sea ice for improved prediction and understanding of Arctic climate systems?

**Core Objectives**:
- Develop GNN architectures that capture spatial relationships between sea ice regions and temporal evolution patterns
- Improve sea ice extent and concentration prediction accuracy over existing methods [P1]
- Create interpretable models that reveal physical mechanisms driving sea ice dynamics
- Enable multi-scale analysis from local ice floe interactions to pan-Arctic patterns

**Scientific Impact**: This research addresses critical gaps in climate modeling by leveraging graph structures to represent sea ice as interconnected spatial regions, potentially improving climate predictions and Arctic shipping route planning.

## 2. Experiments

**Experiment 1: Spatial Graph Construction and Baseline GNN Performance**
- *Hypothesis*: Graph representations of sea ice regions will outperform grid-based CNN approaches for spatial pattern recognition
- *Setup*: Construct graphs from NSIDC sea ice concentration data using spatial adjacency and similarity-based edges
- *Baselines*: CNN-LSTM, standard LSTM, linear regression on gridded data
- *Evaluation Metrics*: RMSE, MAE, spatial correlation coefficient, ice edge accuracy
- *Expected Outcome*: 15-25% improvement in prediction accuracy over CNN baselines

**Experiment 2: Temporal Graph Evolution with Physics-Informed Constraints**
- *Hypothesis*: Incorporating physical constraints (energy conservation, mass balance) will improve long-term prediction stability [P7]
- *Setup*: Implement physics-informed GNN with conservation laws as regularization terms
- *Baselines*: Standard GNN without physics constraints, traditional numerical models
- *Evaluation Metrics*: Long-term drift, energy conservation error, physical plausibility scores
- *Expected Outcome*: Reduced prediction drift and improved physical consistency over 30+ day forecasts

**Experiment 3: Multi-Scale Graph Attention for Regional Analysis**
- *Hypothesis*: Attention mechanisms can identify critical regions and scales for sea ice prediction [P2]
- *Setup*: Develop hierarchical GNN with attention across multiple spatial scales (local, regional, basin-wide)
- *Baselines*: Single-scale GNN, uniform attention weights
- *Evaluation Metrics*: Regional prediction accuracy, attention weight interpretability, computational efficiency
- *Expected Outcome*: Improved regional predictions and identification of key influence patterns
