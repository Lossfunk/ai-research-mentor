Based on the research literature, I'll design a comprehensive AI research plan that leverages your strengths without requiring Python programming.

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Research Focus**: Evaluating AI-assisted qualitative research methods and developing frameworks for human-AI collaboration in data analysis.

**Primary Goals**:
- Compare the effectiveness of AI tools versus human analysis in qualitative research [P2][P3]
- Develop and validate prompt design frameworks for AI-assisted qualitative analysis [P1]
- Create guidelines for integrating AI into traditional qualitative research workflows [P8]

**Research Questions**:
1. How do AI-generated insights compare to human expert analysis in terms of accuracy and depth?
2. What prompt design strategies optimize AI performance in qualitative data analysis?
3. How can researchers maintain methodological rigor when incorporating AI tools?

## 2. Experiments

**Experiment 1: Comparative Analysis Study**
- **Hypothesis**: AI tools can achieve comparable thematic analysis quality to human experts when using structured prompts [P1][P2]
- **Setup**: Recruit 20 human experts and compare their analysis of interview transcripts with ChatGPT/Claude outputs using standardized prompts
- **Baselines**: Traditional manual coding by experienced qualitative researchers
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Inter-rater reliability, theme identification accuracy, analysis depth scores, time efficiency
- **Expected Outcomes**: AI achieves 70-80% agreement with human experts while reducing analysis time by 60%

**Experiment 2: Prompt Framework Development**
- **Hypothesis**: Structured prompt frameworks significantly improve AI qualitative analysis performance [P1]
- **Setup**: Test 5 different prompt design approaches across 3 AI models using the same dataset
- **Baselines**: Generic prompts without structured frameworks
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Coding consistency, theme coherence, methodological alignment with qualitative standards
- **Expected Outcomes**: Framework-guided prompts show 40% improvement in analysis quality metrics

**Experiment 3: Workflow Integration Study**
- **Hypothesis**: Hybrid human-AI workflows maintain research quality while improving efficiency [P8]
- **Setup**: Design 3 different integration approaches (AI-first, human-first, collaborative) and test with research teams
- **Baselines**: Traditional fully-manual qualitative research processes
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Research quality scores, time-to-completion, researcher satisfaction, methodological rigor maintenance
- **Expected Outcomes**: Collaborative approach achieves best balance of quality and efficiency

## 3. Timeline for Next 6 Months

**Month 1**: Literature review completion, IRB approval, participant recruitment
**Month 2**: Experiment 1 data collection, initial prompt framework development
**Month 3**: Experiment 1 analysis, Experiment 2 implementation and data collection
**Month 4**: Experiment 2 analysis, Experiment 3 design and pilot testing
**Month 5**: Experiment 3 full implementation, cross-experiment analysis
**Month 6**: Results synthesis, paper drafting, conference submission preparation

## 4. Resources

**People**:
- Principal investigator (you) - research design, analysis, writing
- 2-3 qualitative research experts as consultants/validators
- 20 expert coders for comparative studies
- 1 research assistant for data management and coordination

**Compute**: 
- API access to GPT-4, Claude, and other LLMs (~$500/month)
- Standard laptop/desktop for analysis and writing
- Cloud storage for data management

**Tools**:
- Qualitative analysis software (NVivo, Atlas.ti, or free alternatives like RQDA)
- Survey platforms for data collection
- Statistical software for quantitative analysis (R with GUI, SPSS, or Excel)

**Datasets**:
- Interview transcripts from existing studies (with permission)
- Focus group discussions
- Open-source qualitative datasets for validation

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| IRB approval delays | Medium | High | Submit early, prepare alternative datasets |
| Expert recruitment challenges | High | Medium | Leverage professional networks, offer compensation |
| AI model access limitations | Low | High | Secure multiple API accounts, budget for costs |
| Data quality issues | Medium | Medium | Implement validation protocols, pilot test |
| Methodological criticism | Medium | High | Engage qualitative research community early |
| Limited generalizability | High | Medium | Test across multiple domains and contexts |

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-up Directions

**Immediate Extensions**:
- Cross-cultural validation of AI analysis frameworks
- Domain-specific prompt optimization (healthcare, education, social sciences)
- Real-time AI assistance tools for qualitative researchers

**Long-term Directions**:
- AI-assisted mixed-methods research integration
- Ethical frameworks for AI in sensitive qualitative research
- Training programs for researchers adopting AI tools [P4]
- Development of specialized AI models for qualitative analysis

**Potential Collaborations**:
- Partner with qualitative research software companies
- Engage with professional associations (International Association of Qualitative Inquiry)
- Collaborate with AI ethics researchers
