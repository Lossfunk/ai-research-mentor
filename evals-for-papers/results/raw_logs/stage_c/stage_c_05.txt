I can definitely help you plan AI research without Python skills! Let me first gather some context to give you the most useful guidance.

## Quick Intake Questions

To tailor a realistic path for you, I need to understand:

1. **Resources & Time**: How many hours per week can you dedicate? Do you have access to compute (cloud credits, university cluster) or are you working locally?

2. **Current Position**: Are you a student, transitioning from another field, or exploring AI research independently? Any coursework or projects underway?

3. **Mentorship & Collaboration**: Do you have advisor access, lab mates, or are you working solo?

4. **Goals & Timeline**: What's your target milestone? (e.g., publish a workshop paper, contribute to a project, build foundational skills for a PhD application) When?

5. **Biggest Bottleneck**: Is it the programming barrier, picking a problem, understanding the math, or something else?

## Immediate Guidance (While You Answer)

**Intuition**: AI research has multiple valid entry points—you don't need to code from scratch to contribute meaningfully. Many researchers focus on problem formulation, experimental design, theoretical analysis, or using high-level tools where the programming is abstracted away.

**Why this is principled**: Successful research depends more on asking the right questions and designing rigorous experiments than on implementation prowess [research heuristic from Hamming's "You and Your Research"]. Many impactful papers emerge from collaborations where different people handle theory, experimentation, and engineering.

### Three Concrete Paths (Pick Based on Your Answers):

**Path A – No-Code/Low-Code Research** (0-5 hrs/week, solo-friendly)  
Focus on research areas where you can contribute through analysis, design, or using GUI tools:
- **Prompt engineering research**: Use ChatGPT, Claude API playground, or similar interfaces to systematically test hypotheses about model behavior
- **Dataset curation & analysis**: Many impactful papers focus on data quality, bias detection, or benchmark design—often doable in spreadsheets or low-code tools
- **Theoretical work**: If you have math background, work on formal analysis, proofs, or conceptual frameworks

**Path B – Collaborate & Learn** (5-15 hrs/week, requires partners)  
Partner with someone who codes while you handle:
- Research question formulation and literature review
- Experimental design and hypothesis generation
- Results interpretation and writing
- *Simultaneously* learn Python basics (2-3 hrs/week) using AI research as motivation

**Path C – Tool-Assisted Rapid Upskilling** (15+ hrs/week, high commitment)  
Use modern AI coding assistants to accelerate learning:
- Learn Python *through* research projects using GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or ChatGPT as pair programmers
- Start with modifying existing research code rather than writing from scratch
- Focus on understanding concepts; let AI handle syntax

**Next Action** (do this today): Answer the 5 intake questions above so I can give you a concrete 2-week Phase 0 plan with specific deliverables matched to your situation.

Once you respond, I'll provide a gated plan with clear success criteria before expanding to longer-term strategy.
