# AI Research Execution Plan (No Programming Required)

## 1. Problem Framing and Goals

**Research Focus**: Theoretical analysis of AI systems' societal impact and cognitive architectures [P1][P4]

**Primary Goal**: Develop conceptual frameworks for understanding how AI systems interact with human cognition and social structures without requiring programming skills [P6][P7]

**Research Questions**:
- How do current AI systems exhibit cognitive biases that mirror human decision-making patterns?
- What theoretical frameworks best explain the emergence of reasoning capabilities in large language models?
- How can we systematically evaluate AI system behavior using qualitative research methods?

This approach leverages the growing field of "AI for social science" research [P1] while focusing on theoretical contributions that don't require coding expertise [P7].

## 2. Experiments

**Experiment 1: Cognitive Bias Analysis in AI Systems**
- **Hypothesis**: AI systems exhibit systematic cognitive biases that can be categorized using established psychological frameworks
- **Setup**: Use no-code AI tools to analyze outputs from multiple language models across standardized bias-testing prompts [P7]
- **Baselines**: Compare against established human cognitive bias literature and existing AI bias studies
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Bias frequency, consistency across models, alignment with human bias patterns
- **Expected Outcomes**: Identification of 3-5 consistent bias patterns with theoretical explanations

**Experiment 2: Multi-Step Reasoning Framework Validation**
- **Hypothesis**: Different prompting strategies reveal distinct reasoning architectures in language models [P3]
- **Setup**: Systematic analysis of reasoning traces using structured qualitative coding methods
- **Baselines**: Chain-of-thought vs. direct prompting vs. few-shot examples
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reasoning coherence, logical consistency, error pattern analysis
- **Expected Outcomes**: Taxonomy of reasoning patterns with predictive framework

**Experiment 3: Neuro-Symbolic Integration Assessment**
- **Hypothesis**: Current AI systems show measurable gaps in symbolic reasoning that can be characterized theoretically [P4][P5]
- **Setup**: Qualitative analysis of AI performance on symbolic logic tasks using existing datasets
- **Baselines**: Pure neural vs. hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches from literature
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Symbolic reasoning accuracy, error categorization, generalization patterns
- **Expected Outcomes**: Theoretical model of symbolic reasoning limitations in current AI

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Limited access to AI systems | Medium | High | Establish partnerships with institutions having API access; use free tiers strategically |
| Theoretical frameworks lack empirical grounding | Medium | Medium | Regular validation with domain experts; anchor in established literature [G2] |
| Qualitative analysis becomes too subjective | High | Medium | Develop clear coding schemes; use inter-rater reliability checks |
| Research becomes too broad/unfocused | Medium | High | Follow focused problem selection principles [G9][G13]; regular milestone reviews |
| No-code tools prove insufficient | Low | Medium | Identify programming collaborators early; focus on tool-agnostic methodologies |
| Findings lack novelty/impact | Medium | High | Emphasize real progress signals over vanity metrics [G1]; focus on tractable problems |

## 6. Stretch Ideas and Follow-up Directions

**Immediate Extensions**:
- Cross-cultural analysis of AI bias patterns across different languages and cultural contexts
