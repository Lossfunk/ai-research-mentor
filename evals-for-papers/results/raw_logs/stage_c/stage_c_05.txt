## 1. Problem framing and goals

**Research objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness of no-code AI platforms for democratizing machine learning research, focusing on comparative analysis across platforms and their ability to replicate traditional coding-based ML workflows.

**Research goals**: 
- Benchmark leading no-code platforms (Orange, Weka, RapidMiner, CreateML) against traditional Python-based ML
- Assess platforms' ability to maintain model interpretability while reducing technical barriers
- Establish best practices for non-programmers conducting rigorous AI research

## 2. Experiments

**Experiment 1: Platform-to-platform consistency study**
*Hypothesis*: No-code platforms will show statistically similar accuracy (±5%) across platforms for standard classification tasks using identical datasets and algorithm settings.
*Setup*: Deploy 10 standard ML datasets (Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer) across Orange, Weka, and CreateML using identical algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM).
*Baselines*: Python-based sci-kit-learn implementations as ground truth
*Metrics*: Test accuracy, training time, hyperparameter sensitivity, interpretability score (using metrics from systematic review [P2])
*Expected outcome*: Platforms within 5% accuracy range of each other and Python baselines

**Experiment 2: Non-expert validation study**
*Hypothesis*: Domain experts with no coding background can achieve equivalent model performance (±3%) compared to programmers using the same platform.
*Setup*: Recruit 30 domain experts (medicine, finance, agriculture), provide 2-hour training on Orange, compare to 30 programmers using Python
*Baselines*: Performance difference between non-programmers vs programmers using same datasets
*Metrics*: Model accuracy, feature engineering time, hyperparameter tuning effectiveness, user satisfaction
*Expected outcome*: Non-programmers achieve 95% of coder performance in their domain expertise

**Experiment 3: Reproducibility and robustness evaluation**
*Hypothesis*: No-code platforms maintain reproducibility (≥90% accuracy consistency) across different data splits and configurations.
*Setup*: Test each platform with 10-fold cross-validation on 5 benchmark datasets, evaluate reproducibility metrics
*Baselines*: Industry-standard reproducibility benchmarks [P4]
*Metrics*: Coefficient of variation in accuracy, parameter sensitivity, seed-dependent variance, interpretability drift
*Expected outcome*: Coefficient of variation <5% across different training runs

**Intuition**: No-code platforms are designed to democratize access to ML, but we need systematic evaluation to establish reliability and identify best practices. The research aligns with growing evidence that these platforms can match traditional implementations [P2,P3].

**Why this is principled**: Systematic evaluation studies are fundamental in ML research [G#], especially for emerging tools. By benchmarking multiple platforms against baselines, we establish empirical evidence rather than anecdotal claims.
