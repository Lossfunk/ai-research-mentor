Below is a practical, step-by-step publishing playbook tailored for a cross-lingual dialogue paper. It covers camera-ready preparation, artifact packaging, archival uploads, and venue-ready disclosure statements. Replace placeholders with your specifics and follow your venue’s exact author instructions.

Phase 0 — Confirm venue policies (30–45 minutes)
- Download the camera-ready kit and policy pages (template, page limits, figure rules, ethics/repro checklists, anonymity/de-anonymization rules, artifact policy, supplementary limits).
- Note disclosure requirements: ethics/limitations, human subjects/IRB, data statement, COI/funding, use-of-generative-AI disclosure, compute/environmental impact, reproducibility checklist.

Phase 1 — Camera-ready preparation (content and compliance)
1) Lock claims and content
- Update results and error bars; remove speculative claims; ensure all cross-lingual findings are supported (per language/script).
- Move fragile or long tables to the supplement; keep 48-hour buffer before final submission.

2) De-anonymize properly
- Restore author names/affiliations, prior-work self-citations, and acknowledgements; replace anonymized links with stable public links (or DOIs).
- Scrub any residual “anonymous” markers in text and metadata.

3) Multilingual typography and examples QA
- Fonts: use Unicode-safe fonts (e.g., Noto families) and embed all fonts in the PDF; verify CJK/RTL/diacritics render correctly and copy-paste cleanly.
- Directionality: confirm RTL text is correctly ordered; avoid mixed-script rendering bugs.
- Transcriptions: define transliteration policy (e.g., ISO, national standard); include glossing rules if applicable.
- Sensitive text: ensure no PII in example dialogues; redact/perturb any potentially identifying content; confirm consent or synthetic status is labeled.

4) Structure required sections
- Abstract/Introduction: clearly state cross-lingual scope (languages, scripts, regions).
- Methods: data collection, alignment, translation/annotation pipelines, quality control.
- Evaluation: automatic (BLEU/COMET/BERTScore/etc.) and human evaluation (protocol, rubric, IAA) across languages; error analysis with language-specific insights.
- Ethics/Limitations/Data Statement/Human Subjects: add as explicit sections (see Phase 4 templates).
- Reproducibility: list seeds, splits, hardware, API versions; link to artifacts.

5) Figures/tables and references
- Consistent units and metrics; identical color scales across models/languages.
- Language codes: use ISO 639-1/3 with script tags if needed (e.g., zh-Hans vs zh-Hant).
- Verify references, DOIs, and that all citations compile; remove broken links.

Phase 2 — Artifact packaging (code, data, models)
6) Repository structure and determinism
- repo/: src/, scripts/, configs/, data_scripts/, eval/, docs/, env/ (env.yml/requirements.txt/Dockerfile), licenses/, tests/, ci/.
- Determinism: fixed seeds, dataloader shuffles, tokenizer versions; log commit hash, language set, metrics.

7) Cross-lingual evaluation harness
- Implement language-aware tokenization and normalization; support RTL/CJK; locale-safe file I/O.
- Provide automatic metrics (BLEU/chrF/COMET/BERTScore) and human-eval tooling (UI or annotation templates); support multilingual safety/toxicity filters if used.
- One-command runs for 2–3 headline results:
  - bash scripts/run_repro.sh configs/xling_taskA.yaml
  - bash scripts/run_repro.sh configs/xling_taskB.yaml

8) Dataset packaging
- Prefer fetch/prepare scripts for third-party sources; don’t mirror restricted data.
- Dataset ledger (dataset_ledger.md): for each dataset/language, include name, DOI/URL, version/date, license/TOS, collection method, consent status, PII measures, segmentation rules, splits, alignment details, translation policy, and known biases.
- For social-media/dialogue data: respect platform TOS; if required, release only IDs with hydration scripts; provide rate-limit notes.

9) Model packaging
- Provide checkpoints (base + small/quantized), SHA256 checksums; support common formats (PyTorch + optional ONNX).
- Model card(s) with language coverage, training data sources, intended use, limitations, and safety notes.

10) Documentation
- README: quickstart, lang coverage matrix, configs→table mapping, reproduction instructions.
- docs/: model_card_*.md, dataset_card_*.md, usage.md, expected_vs_obtained.md (with CIs), RESPONSIBLE-USE.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- Licenses: LICENSE (code), MODEL_LICENSE (models), NOTICE, third_party_licenses.txt.

Phase 3 — Archival uploads and identifiers
11) Versioning and DOIs
- Tag repo v1.0.0; create a GitHub Release draft with checksums.
- Zenodo: link to GitHub to mint a DOI for v1.0.0 (software); fill DataCite metadata (keywords, languages, contributors with ORCID).
- Datasets: deposit on Hugging Face Datasets and/or Zenodo/OSF; each dataset gets its own DOI with clear licenses and version numbers.
- Models: upload to Hugging Face Hub with the same tag and model cards; consider gated access if license or content requires it.

12) Preprint and camera-ready mirrors
- arXiv: upload the camera-ready or preprint-compliant version (check venue policy). Ensure fonts are embedded; primary category cs.CL; include ancillary files if needed.
- Institutional repository (optional): deposit accepted manuscript and artifacts with metadata.

13) Containers and packages (optional but helpful)
- Push Docker images (CPU/GPU) to GHCR or Docker Hub; include labels with version/DOI.
- Publish a minimal PyPI package for the evaluator (pin dependencies).

Phase 4 — Disclosure statements (copy-ready templates)
14) Ethics Statement (concise)
- We release a cross-lingual dialogue resource and models intended for research. The data exclude PII to the best of our knowledge; where data originate from public platforms, we comply with platform TOS and respect deletion requests. Potential risks include cultural bias, harmful content propagation, and misuse for surveillance; we mitigate via filtering, documentation of known biases, and a responsible-use policy. Residual risks remain; users must conduct domain-appropriate reviews before deployment.

15) Data Statement (Bender & Friedman-style essentials)
- Languages and scripts: list languages with ISO codes and scripts (e.g., hi-Deva, ar-Arab, zh-Hans).
- Provenance: sources, collection dates, consent/terms, and any DUAs.
- Speakers/authors: demographics if known or explicitly state “unknown”; no attempt to infer sensitive attributes.
- Preprocessing: tokenization, normalization, alignment/translation methods; filtering for toxic or adult content; PII removal.
- Licenses: dataset license(s) and redistribution policy; third-party data are referenced via scripts only.
- Intended uses and limitations: research/benchmarking; not for high-stakes decisions.

16) Human Subjects / IRB
- If human annotation/evaluation was conducted: protocol ID, approval/exemption, consent, compensation, annotator qualifications and language competencies, de-identification, and data retention policy.

17) Limitations
- Coverage gaps (languages, dialects, scripts, domains), translation/annotation noise, domain shift, and known failure modes (e.g., code-switching, low-resource morphology).

18) Reproducibility Checklist
- Seeds and versions, hardware, API/model versions, exact splits, hyperparameters, and time/compute to reproduce main results.

19) Compute and Environmental Impact
- Training/evaluation GPU-hours, tool used to estimate energy (e.g., CodeCarbon), region assumptions, and any efficiency measures (mixed precision, early stopping).

20) Conflicts of Interest and Funding
- Disclose financial/affiliation COIs, funding sources, and in-kind compute or data support.

21) Use of Generative AI in Writing/Assets (if applicable)
- Declare any LLM assistance in drafting text, figures, or code and how it was verified for accuracy.

Phase 5 — Final submission package checks (run like a release)
22) Paper and supplement
- Validate camera-ready template; pass a PDF/A and embedded-font check.
- Link checker: verify all URLs/DOIs; ensure links resolve and are non-tracking.
- Supplement size/format within limits; include extra examples by language and annotation guidelines.

23) Artifacts sanity pass
- Fresh-machine reproduction of 2–3 results within stated CIs.
- Run tests for non-English scripts and RTL cases; verify no encoding errors.
- Confirm licenses are present and compatible: code (MIT/Apache-2.0), models (Apache/OpenRAIL if usage restrictions), data (CC BY/CC0/ODbL or original terms).

24) Accessibility and inclusivity
- Alt text for figures; legible color schemes; avoid color-only encodings.
- Respect endonyms and community-preferred language names where possible; note if any indigenous or sensitive-language data are included and the community consultation status.

25) Submit and flip artifacts public
- Upload the camera-ready PDF and supplement per venue instructions.
- Publish GitHub Release and Zenodo DOI; un-gate HF repos if appropriate; post release notes with checksums.
- Add CITATION.cff and badges (DOI, license, HF, Docker).

Appendices — Quick templates you can paste and adapt
- Responsible-Use excerpt (repo): Intended research use; prohibited uses include surveillance, profiling, or deployment without bias/safety evaluation in target languages. Users must comply with data-source terms and local laws.
- Dataset card key fields: languages/scripts; sources; collection/consent; preprocessing; splits; metrics; ethical considerations; license; citation.
- Model card key fields: training data scope; languages; intended uses; limitations; evaluation coverage; safety considerations; license; version/checksums.

Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Encoding/rendering issues in non-Latin scripts → Use Noto fonts, embed fonts, and test copy-paste; include screenshots only as a last resort.
- TOS/license violations for scraped dialogue → Release IDs + hydration; keep a removal process; document TOS compliance.
- Misaligned translations or noisy annotations → Provide QA procedures, IAA stats, and error analyses per language.
- Unreproducible metrics across languages → Pin metric versions and tokenizers; log config and language codes; publish expected ranges.

If you share your target venue and language set, I can map this playbook to the venue’s exact checklist (e.g., ACL Responsible NLP, ARR Data Statement) and pre-fill your disclosure sections.
