### WEEK 2 (Days 8-14): Ethics Statements & Broader Impacts

#### Day 8-9: Mandatory Ethics Statement (ALL VENUES)

**Template for Privacy NLP Paper:**

```markdown
## Ethics Statement

### Privacy Guarantees and Limitations
This work proposes [method name] with [ε,δ]-differential privacy guarantees 
under the assumption of [threat model]. We acknowledge the following limitations:

1. **Privacy budget**: Our method requires ε=[value], which provides [strong/moderate/weak] 
   privacy protection. Users should assess whether this meets their privacy requirements.

2. **Threat model assumptions**: Our guarantees hold under [honest-but-curious/malicious] 
   adversaries with [specify capabilities]. Stronger adversaries may break these guarantees.

3. **Composition**: When combined with other analyses, privacy budgets compose [additively/
   via advanced composition], potentially weakening overall privacy.

### Data Privacy and Consent
- **Dataset**: We use [dataset name], which contains [type of sensitive information].
- **IRB approval**: [Obtained from X institution, approval #Y] OR [Exempted because...]
- **Consent**: Original data collection obtained informed consent for [research use/
  specific purposes]. Our use is consistent with original consent.
- **De-identification**: We applied [k-anonymity/suppression/generalization] to remove 
  [list of identifiers]. Residual re-identification risk is estimated at [X%].

### Potential Harms and Mitigation
1. **False sense of security**: Users may over-trust privacy guarantees. We clearly 
   document assumptions and limitations in Section X.
   
2. **Reduced utility**: Privacy protection reduces model accuracy by [X%]. Users must 
   weigh privacy-utility tradeoffs for their use case.
   
3. **Dual-use concerns**: Our attack evaluation methods could be misused. We release 
   only defensive code and recommend responsible disclosure practices.

4. **Bias amplification**: Privacy mechanisms may disproportionately affect minority 
   groups. We evaluate fairness metrics in Section Y.

### Reproducibility vs. Privacy Tradeoff
We cannot release [raw data/model checkpoints/gradients] due to privacy concerns. 
Instead, we provide:
- Synthetic data with similar statistical properties
- Differentially private model checkpoints (with privacy budget accounting)
- Code for reproducing experiments on users' own private data
```

#### Day 10-11: Broader Impacts Section

- [ ] **Positive impacts**:
  - [ ] Enables privacy-preserving applications (healthcare, finance, etc.)
  - [ ] Reduces data collection requirements
  - [ ] Empowers individuals with data control
  
- [ ] **Negative impacts**:
  - [ ] Could enable censorship or surveillance if misapplied
  - [ ] May reduce model performance, limiting accessibility
  - [ ] Privacy-utility tradeoff may disadvantage certain groups
  
- [ ] **Societal considerations**:
  - [ ] Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA)
  - [ ] Equity and fairness implications
  - [ ] Environmental cost (if computationally expensive)

#### Day 12-14: Limitations Section (MANDATORY)

**Privacy-specific limitations to address:**

- [ ] **Privacy guarantee scope**:
  - What is protected (training data? model parameters? predictions?)
  - What is NOT protected (model architecture? hyperparameters? aggregate statistics?)
  
- [ ] **Assumption violations**:
  - What happens if threat model assumptions break?
  - Auxiliary information attacks
  - Composition with other systems
  
- [ ] **Scalability limits**:
  - Maximum dataset size tested
  - Computational constraints
  - Communication overhead (if federated)
  
- [ ] **Generalization**:
  - Domains/tasks tested
  - Languages covered
  - Model architectures evaluated

## 🔧 COMMON PRIVACY PAPER ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: Vague Privacy Claims
❌ **Bad**: "Our method preserves privacy"
✅ **Good**: "Our method satisfies (ε=1.0, δ=10⁻⁵)-differential privacy under the assumption of an honest-but-curious server"

### Issue 2: Missing Privacy Budget Composition
❌ **Bad**: "We train for 100 epochs with ε=0.1 per step"
✅ **Good**: "We train for 100 epochs with per-step privacy (ε=0.1, δ=10⁻⁵). Using advanced composition (Theorem 3.3 from [Dwork & Roth 2014]), total privacy is (ε=2.3, δ=10⁻⁴)"

### Issue 3: Unrealistic Threat Model
❌ **Bad**: "We assume the adversary has no auxiliary information"
✅ **Good**: "We assume an honest-but-curious adversary with access to the model API and public demographic statistics, but not the training data"

### Issue 4: No Baseline Comparison
❌ **Bad**: "Our method achieves 85% accuracy with ε=1.0"
✅ **Good**: "Our method achieves 85% accuracy with ε=1.0, compared to 92% for non-private baseline and 78% for prior DP method [X]"

### Issue 5: Missing Attack Evaluation
❌ **Bad**: "Our method is private because we add noise"
✅ **Good**: "We evaluate privacy via membership inference attack, achieving AUC=0.52 (near random guessing at 0.5), compared to AUC=0.73 for non-private baseline"
