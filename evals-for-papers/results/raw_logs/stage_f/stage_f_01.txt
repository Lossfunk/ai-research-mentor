Before I provide detailed venue recommendations, I need to collect a few key details to tailor my advice:

1. **Compute & Resources**: What GPU access do you have (e.g., single A100, cluster access)? How many hours/week can you dedicate?
2. **Current Stage**: Do you have preliminary results, or are you still in the planning phase?
3. **Collaboration Context**: Are you working solo, with an advisor, or in a team? Do you have experienced co-authors for submission?
4. **Target Timeline**: When do you want to submit (specific month)? This affects which deadlines are realistic.
5. **Biggest Bottleneck**: What's your main concern—experimental throughput, writing quality, novelty validation, or something else?

That said, let me provide initial venue recommendations with the assumption you're aiming for submission in ~6 months:

## **Intuition**

The venue choice hinges on what story your compression method tells. If you're introducing a novel algorithm with theoretical guarantees, NeurIPS/ICML reward that rigor [P3]. If you're showing practical speedups on real LLM tasks with minimal accuracy loss, ACL/EMNLP or MLSys value applied impact [P4][P7]. Workshops let you test ideas quickly but carry less prestige—use them strategically for early feedback or when timeline is tight.

## **Why This Is Principled**

Top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) require both novelty and thorough empirical validation across multiple baselines and datasets [P5]. They increasingly demand reproducibility artifacts and ethics statements to address environmental costs of large models. NLP venues (ACL, EMNLP) prioritize task-specific performance and often accept papers with strong empirical contributions even if theory is incremental [P4]. MLSys uniquely requires end-to-end system evaluation, not just algorithmic improvements. Matching your contribution type to venue expectations maximizes acceptance probability.

## **Simulated Reviewer Summary (NeurIPS-style)**

**Paper**: *[Your Title]: Efficient Compression of Large Language Models via [Your Method]*

### **Reviewer 1 (Score: 6/10 - Weak Accept)**
**Summary**: The paper presents a compression method combining quantization and pruning for LLMs, achieving X% size reduction with Y% accuracy retention on GLUE benchmarks. The approach is technically sound and experiments are comprehensive.

**Strengths**:
- Clear motivation and well-written presentation
- Thorough ablation studies isolating quantization vs. pruning contributions
- Competitive results compared to recent baselines [P3][P4]
- Code and model checkpoints promised for reproducibility

**Weaknesses**:
- Limited novelty—combines existing techniques without significant algorithmic innovation
- Missing comparisons to LoRA-based compression and distillation methods
- Evaluation limited to encoder-only models (BERT-family); no decoder-only LLMs (GPT-style)
- Environmental impact discussed but no actual carbon footprint measurements
- Scalability unclear: largest model tested is 1.3B parameters

**Questions**:
1. How does your method perform on generative tasks (not just classification)?
2. What is the wall-clock inference speedup on actual hardware (not just FLOPs)?
3. Can you provide theoretical analysis of the compression-accuracy tradeoff?

**Recommendation**: Borderline accept if authors address decoder-only models and provide hardware benchmarks.

---

### **Reviewer 2 (Score: 7/10 - Accept)**
**Summary**: Strong empirical work demonstrating practical LLM compression with minimal performance degradation. The joint optimization framework is well-motivated and results are convincing.

**Strengths**:
- Novel joint optimization objective balancing compression ratio and task performance
- Extensive experiments across 8 downstream tasks
- Ablations clearly show each component's contribution
- Honest discussion of failure cases (e.g., poor performance on reasoning tasks)
- Ethics statement addresses potential for enabling on-device deployment in low-resource settings

**Weaknesses**:
- Writing could be tightened in Section 3 (methodology)
- Figure 2 is hard to parse—consider splitting into multiple subfigures
- Missing error bars on some results (Table 3)
- Broader impact statement feels generic; could discuss specific deployment scenarios

**Minor Issues**:
- Typo in Equation 4 (missing subscript)
- Citation formatting inconsistent (some arxiv links, some conference versions)

**Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.

---

### **Reviewer 3 (Score: 5/10 - Weak Reject)**
**Summary**: The paper tackles an important problem but falls short on novelty and depth of analysis. The experimental setup is reasonable but lacks critical comparisons.

**Weaknesses**:
- Core contribution unclear—is it the joint optimization, the specific quantization scheme, or the pruning strategy?
- No comparison to recent SOTA like [P7] Modular Transformers or [P4] XTC (Extreme Compression)
- Evaluation metrics too narrow—only accuracy, no latency/memory/energy measurements
- Reproducibility concerns: hyperparameter search details missing; no discussion of sensitivity
- Ethics statement doesn't address potential dual-use (compressed models easier to deploy for harmful applications)

**Strengths**:
- Problem is timely and relevant
- Writing is generally clear
- Ablations are thorough

**Questions**:
1. Why not compare against knowledge distillation baselines?
2. How sensitive is the method to the compression ratio hyperparameter?
3. What happens with models >10B parameters?

**Recommendation**: Reject; encourage resubmission with stronger baselines and clearer positioning.

---

### **Meta-Review (Area Chair Decision: Borderline Accept)**
The paper presents solid empirical work on LLM compression with mixed reviews. Reviewers agree the problem is important and experiments are generally well-executed. Main concerns: (1) novelty is incremental, (2) missing key baselines (distillation, recent SOTA), (3) evaluation limited to smaller models and classification tasks. Authors should address Reviewer 3's concerns about baselines and extend to decoder-only models (Reviewer 1). If these are addressed in revision, the paper would be a solid accept.

**Conditional Accept**: Requires shepherd to verify baseline comparisons and hardware benchmarks are added.

## **Next Actions (1-3 Days)**

1. **Clarify your contribution angle**: Is your work algorithmic (novel method), empirical (better results), or systems (deployment-focused)? This determines venue priority.
2. **Check current baselines**: Ensure you're comparing against [P3], [P4], and [P7]—reviewers will expect these.
3. **Draft ethics statement now**: Don't wait until submission. Address: environmental cost, dual-use risks, accessibility benefits.

**Strategic Questions**:
1. Do you have access to models >7B parameters for evaluation? (Critical for top venues)
2. Can you measure actual inference latency on target hardware (edge devices, mobile)?
3. What's your unique angle—are you combining techniques in a novel way, or introducing a fundamentally new compression paradigm?
4. Have you identified a specific weakness in existing methods [P3][P4] that your approach addresses?
