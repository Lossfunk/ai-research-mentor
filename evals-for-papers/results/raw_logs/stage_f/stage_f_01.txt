Here are strong venue options for a 6‑month project on compressible LLMs, with ethics and formatting constraints called out. I also include three concrete, falsifiable experiments you can run and a brief simulated reviewer summary.

Best-fit venues and what to expect
- NeurIPS (main conference)
  - Fit: Core ML venue with a long history of model compression, quantization, and efficiency work.
  - Ethics: Requires adherence to Ethics Guidelines and an associated checklist; papers may be flagged for ethics review [2][4].
  - Formatting: Use the official NeurIPS template/style files and follow the current Call for Papers for length, anonymity, and artifact policies [1][3].
- ICML (main conference)
  - Fit: Strong for principled compression methods and optimization for efficient LLMs.
  - Ethics: Follow ICML author instructions and any policy updates in the Call; ethics considerations are part of the review process [6].
  - Formatting: Use the official ICML template (see example paper) and adhere to page limits and supplementary material rules specified for the year [6][8].
- ICLR (main conference)
  - Fit: Especially good for method-heavy work (quantization-aware training, PEFT under compression) with open review.
  - Ethics: Submissions can receive ethics review; see Reviewer Guide for how ethics concerns are handled [12].
  - Formatting: Follow the ICLR formatting instructions (OpenReview template, content limits) [10].
- MLSys
  - Fit: Best when your contribution emphasizes systems-level efficiency (throughput/latency/energy), kernels/runtime, or training/inference infra for compressed LLMs.
  - Ethics and formatting: Follow the MLSys CfP for topical fit, required template, and artifact expectations [19].
- COLM (Conference on Language Modeling)
  - Fit: Ideal for LLM-focused contributions (e.g., perplexity, scaling laws under compression, tokenizer/kv‑cache compression).
  - Ethics: Code of Ethics applies; consider safety, bias, and misuse risks in compressed deployments [32].
  - Formatting: Use the official author guide and template; check CfP for limits and submission process [30][33].
- ACL/EMNLP (if your work is NLP task-centric)
  - Fit: Good if the narrative centers on downstream NLP quality/robustness of compressed LLMs.
  - Ethics: ACL publication ethics policy applies; datasets/human studies require careful reporting [15].
  - Formatting: Use ACLPUB formatting and the conference’s style guidelines [13][16].
- TMLR (rolling review)
  - Fit: Fast feedback cycle and open review; strong option for a 6‑month runway (with potential resubmission iterations).
  - Ethics: TMLR has dedicated ethics guidelines; reviewers may require ethics clarifications or mitigation plans [27].
  - Formatting: Follow TMLR author and submission guides; rolling timeline helps if conference deadlines are tight [24].

Practical pick by goal and 6‑month timing
- Need fast decisions or iterative feedback: TMLR (rolling) [24][27]. You can also aim for COLM if its current cycle aligns [33][30].
- Method-focused contribution with broader ML audience: NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR; choose based on the nearest realistic deadline window and fit to each venue’s culture (ICLR for method clarity + open review, ICML for rigor in optimization, NeurIPS for breadth) [1][6][10][12].
- Systems/performance emphasis (latency/throughput/energy, kernels, deployment): MLSys [19].
- LLM‑centric benchmarks and modeling insights: COLM [33][30][32].
- NLP task performance and safety framing: ACL/EMNLP [13][15][16].

Ethics and formatting checklist (what to prepare regardless of venue)
- Ethics statement addressing societal risks of compressed LLMs (e.g., degradation biases, safety regressions under compression), data provenance, and any human evaluation procedures [2][12][15][27][32].
- Reproducibility: code, configs, seeds, and scripts; report hardware, runtime, and calibration details; follow template and page limits strictly [1][3][6][8][10][16][19][24][30].
- Artifact availability: link to models/checkpoints where allowed; consider anonymized artifact sharing during review if venue permits [1][6][10][19][24].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments to strengthen the paper
1) QLoRA vs 2‑bit finetuning under equal compute
- Hypothesis: 2‑bit finetuning achieves comparable downstream accuracy to 4‑bit QLoRA at the same wall‑clock budget for instruction tuning on 7–13B models.
- Setup: Finetune the same base LLM with (a) 4‑bit QLoRA baseline and (b) a 2‑bit scheme like ApiQ; equalize GPU-hours and batch/sequence budgets. Evaluate on instruction tuning and general benchmarks (MMLU, ARC, GSM8K, MT‑Bench).
- Metrics: Accuracy/Pass@1, MT‑Bench score, perplexity; efficiency: tokens/sec, energy or GPU-hours to target quality.
- Expected outcome: 2‑bit may match or trail slightly on reasoning tasks but close the gap in instruction‑following at the same compute; if not, ablate optimizer and LR schedules to probe stability. Literature anchors: ApiQ for 2‑bit finetuning baselines [ApiQ, 2024].

2) Compression–safety trade-off when distilling to small models
- Hypothesis: Distillation from a safety‑tuned teacher partially mitigates safety regressions induced by aggressive quantization.
- Setup: Compare student models trained with (a) quantization only vs (b) quantization + distillation from a safety‑aligned teacher; evaluate toxicity (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts), jailbreak resistance, and refusal consistency under prompts.
- Metrics: Safety metrics (toxicity scores, refusal rate), standard task accuracy; compute/latency.
- Expected outcome: Distillation improves safety metrics at similar accuracy; include error bars and calibration sweeps to attribute gains to distillation rather than random seeds.

3) KV‑cache and activation compression for long‑context inference
- Hypothesis: Lightweight KV quantization plus selective activation sparsification preserves long‑context QA accuracy with >2× memory reduction and minimal latency overhead on 8–13B models.
- Setup: Evaluate long‑context tasks (e.g., LongBench subsets) under varying KV precisions (8→4→2 bit) and sparsity schedules; measure latency/memory and accuracy.
- Metrics: Exact match/F1 on long‑context QA, retrieval accuracy, memory footprint, tokens/sec.
- Expected outcome: A Pareto frontier showing substantial memory savings with <2% absolute accuracy drop at 4‑bit KV; 2‑bit likely requires error‑aware calibration or compensation.

Brief simulated reviewer summary (for a venue like NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR)
- Summary: This paper proposes a practical pipeline for compressing instruction‑tuned LLMs via 2‑bit parameter finetuning, KV‑cache quantization, and optional distillation for safety. The authors provide strong baselines against 4‑bit QLoRA and open models across 7–13B scales, with thorough ablations on calibration and optimizer choice. Results show competitive accuracy at lower memory and cost, plus a reproducible training/inference recipe.
- Strengths: Clear problem setup; comprehensive evaluation across instruction and reasoning benchmarks; efficiency metrics (throughput, memory, and energy) reported; open‑sourced artifacts; careful ethics statement addressing safety regressions under compression.
- Weaknesses: Limited testing above 13B; fewer multilingual evaluations; safety improvements from distillation are modest and may be dataset‑dependent.
- Questions: How robust are results to domain shift (code/math)? Can the method integrate with structured sparsity or mixture‑of‑experts? Are failures primarily due to optimizer instability or quantization error?
- Score: 6 (weak accept). With stronger evidence on larger models and broader safety tests, this could move to accept.
