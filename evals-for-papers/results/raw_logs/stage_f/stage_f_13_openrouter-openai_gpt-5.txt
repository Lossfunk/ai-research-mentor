Here’s a conference-ready slide outline you can drop into your deck. It front-loads contributions, makes limitations explicit, and ends with a concrete future-work roadmap. Use 12–14 content slides for a 12-minute talk; keep 3–5 backup slides for Q&A.

Slide 1 — Title and one-sentence claim
- Title: Trustworthy Evaluation of Large Language Models
- Authors, affiliation(s)
- One-sentence claim: We present a unified, reproducible framework to evaluate LLM trustworthiness across factuality, robustness, safety, bias, and calibration, with human–automatic metric alignment.
- QR codes/links: code, data/eval harness, models; disclosure of funding/COI if required

Slide 2 — Motivation: Why trustworthiness needs its own evaluation
- Real-world failures: hallucinated citations; jailbreak-induced unsafe responses; biased outputs
- Gap: task accuracy ≠ trustworthy behavior; existing leaderboards underweight safety, calibration, and robustness
- Goal: standardized, reproducible, multi-dimensional trust evaluation

Slide 3 — What “trustworthy” means here (taxonomy)
- Dimensions:
  - Factuality/grounding and citation fidelity
  - Robustness to prompt perturbations and adversarial attacks
  - Safety/toxicity and harmful advice refusal
  - Bias/fairness across demographics and topics
  - Calibration/uncertainty (when to say “I don’t know”)
  - Privacy leakage risk (prompt/data extraction)
- Evaluation modes: single-turn, multi-turn, tool-augmented, retrieval-augmented

Slide 4 — Contributions (highlight early)
- C1: Unified evaluation framework with plug-in tasks, metrics, and attack modules; reproducible seeds and API-version controls
- C2: New/standardized metrics:
  - Factuality with citation verification and provenance scoring
  - Robustness via paraphrase/structure perturbations and jailbreak stress tests
  - Refusal quality, selective prediction, and calibration (ECE/Brier) with abstention costs
- C3: Human–automatic alignment study and guidance for when to trust automated proxies
- C4: Open-source artifact suite (harness, prompts, attack library, adjudication scripts) and documentation for responsible use
- C5: Empirical findings: trade-offs between safety and helpfulness; impact of system prompts/guardrails; variance across seeds and API versions

Slide 5 — Evaluation framework (pipeline view)
- Inputs: prompt templates, task specs, attack policies, datasets
- Execution: version-pinned model runners; response sampling; tool/RAG toggles
- Scoring: automatic metrics; human adjudication UI; tie-breaking rules
- Logging: provenance, RNG seeds, model/API versions, cost/latency, energy (optional)
- Repro: one-command runs; CI toy tests

Slide 6 — Tasks, datasets, and settings
- Task suite: fact-seeking QA, grounded summarization, safety-sensitive scenarios, policy compliance, bias probes
- Languages/domains: note any multilingual or domain-specific sets
- Settings: zero/few-shot, chain-of-thought allowed or not, tool use on/off, RAG corpora provenance
- Train–test separation and contamination checks (high level)

Slide 7 — Metrics (by dimension)
- Factuality: n-gram/semantic consistency + citation correctness
- Robustness: score deltas under paraphrase/noise/attack; attack success rate
- Safety: toxicity/unsafe intent detectors + refusal appropriateness
- Bias/fairness: group-specific performance gaps; directional bias tests
- Calibration/abstention: ECE/Brier; coverage vs accuracy under selective prediction
- Privacy: PII leak probes; memorization canaries
- Human eval: protocol, inter-annotator agreement, rubric alignment

Slide 8 — Key findings (headline results)
- Comparative snapshot across representative models (redacted brand names if policy requires)
- Notable trade-offs: e.g., stricter guardrails reduce jailbreaks but increase over-refusal on benign prompts
- Human–automatic metric correlation strengths/weaknesses
- Cost/latency vs trust metrics (optional plot)

Slide 9 — Case studies (2 quick examples)
- Example 1: Grounded citation passes automatic checks but fails human rubric—why; fix via stricter provenance
- Example 2: Prompt perturbation flips safety decision—what the robustness metric captures

Slide 10 — Ablations and reliability
- Sensitivity to system prompts and temperature
- Seed/API-version variability; confidence intervals
- Effect of RAG quality and retrieval latency on factuality/safety

Slide 11 — Limitations (be explicit)
- Metric validity: detectors can misclassify nuanced legal/medical safety cases
- Coverage: limited languages/domains; narrow bias probes
- Contamination risk: public benchmarks may overlap with pretraining
- Human-eval constraints: annotator expertise, cost, and rubric drift
- Reproducibility: API model drift, undocumented safety policy changes
- Privacy evaluation is proxy-based; does not prove absence of leakage

Slide 12 — Threats to validity and mitigations
- Construct validity: do metrics reflect what users need? Mitigation: rubric calibration and human spot checks
- External validity: lab prompts vs real user behavior. Mitigation: include organic prompts and multi-turn tests
- Measurement error: detector thresholds. Mitigation: sensitivity analysis, dual detectors
- Leakage: audit prompts/corpora; hold-out private sets when possible

Slide 13 — Future work (roadmap)
- Dynamic adversarial evaluation with evolving attack libraries
- Stronger citation verification (retrieval provenance, source grounding scores)
- Multi-turn, tool-augmented and long-context trust evaluation
- Cross-lingual and domain-specialist safety/bias tests
- Privacy stress testing (membership inference, memorization audits)
- Governance: versioned leaderboards, model card ties, evaluator transparency
- Human-in-the-loop: expert panels for high-stakes domains; active adjudication

Slide 14 — Responsible release and artifact pointers
- What we release now: evaluation harness, prompts, attack suites, scoring scripts, sample datasets; model adapters/configs
- Licenses: code (MIT/Apache), data (original licenses via fetch scripts), evaluator models’ terms
- Usage policy: intended use, prohibited use (e.g., deploying evaluators as safety guarantees)
- How to reproduce: 2 one-command scripts; expected ranges; environment pins
- Links/DOIs/QR codes

Slide 15 — Takeaways and call to action
- Summary: multi-dimensional trust evaluation, open tools, and empirical guidance
- Ask: contribute tasks/attacks; run your models with our harness; report back via templates
- Contact/community: repo issues, discussion forum, mailing list

Backup slides (for Q&A)

Presenter tips
- Keep 1–2 minutes on contributions (Slide 4) and 1 minute each on limitations and future work (Slides 11–13)
- Use consistent color coding per trust dimension; mark statistically significant differences
- Include small CI bars or shaded ranges to communicate variability
- Clearly label any brand/API names per venue policy; anonymize if required during review
- If using demo videos, avoid proprietary data and ensure no policy/TOS violations
