Below is a venue‑specific checklist of ethics/compliance sections your language‑model‑for‑law paper should include, plus disclosure checklists and artifact adherence items. Use this as a drafting scaffold and confirm exact, current requirements on each venue’s author page before submission.

NeurIPS
- Required/expected sections in paper
  - Ethics/societal impact statement covering legal‑domain risks (misuse as legal advice, unequal access, jurisdictional constraints), mitigation, and residual risk.
  - Limitations section (dataset coverage, jurisdiction bias, reliability on out‑of‑distribution legal texts).
  - Human subjects/IRB statement if you ran lawyer/lay‑user evaluations (approval/exemption, consent, compensation).
  - Data/Code availability statements; license/TOS compliance (e.g., court opinions vs proprietary databases).
- Disclosure/checklists
  - Reproducibility checklist (datasets, preprocessing, hyperparameters, seeds, compute) completed in the paper or submission form.
  - Dual‑use or sensitive application disclosure (legal decision support is sensitive).
  - Use‑of‑generative‑AI in writing/figures disclosure if applicable.
- Artifact adherence
  - Anonymized code link at submission strongly encouraged; public release by camera‑ready.
  - Include: training/inference code, prompts/templates, evaluation scripts, human‑evaluation protocols, redaction filters, and a data ledger; no redistribution of proprietary legal corpora.

ICML
- Required/expected sections in paper
  - Ethics/impact discussion specifically addressing legal harms (incorrect citations, hallucinated statutes, harmful reliance) and safeguards.
  - Limitations.
  - IRB/consent if human studies; describe annotator qualifications for legal judgments.
  - Data provenance/licensing/TOS compliance (statutes/caselaw, contracts).
- Disclosure/checklists
  - ICML reproducibility checklist completion.
  - COI statements and any dual‑use disclosures.
- Artifact adherence
  - Runnable code/configs for core results; scripts to obtain datasets; prompt suites; evaluation rubrics; seed and compute reporting.

ICLR (OpenReview)
- Required/expected sections in paper
  - Limitations section; ethics statement if work involves sensitive data or human subjects.
  - Human‑evaluation details (recruitment, consent, qualifications, adjudication rules).
  - Data provenance and licensing.
- Disclosure/checklists
  - OpenReview ethics flag if applicable (human subjects, sensitive content).
  - Code link field (anonymized) in the submission form.
- Artifact adherence
  - Anonymized repo with code, prompts, evaluation harness, redaction filters, and a small synthetic example; full release post‑acceptance.

ACL (ARR + ACL Main)
- Required/expected sections in paper
  - Dedicated Ethics Statement addressing legal risks and mitigations; Data Statement (provenance, licensing, preprocessing, demographic attributes if any).
  - Limitations section (mandatory in ACL).
  - IRB/ethics review details for human studies (lawyers, paralegals, crowd workers); consent and de‑identification.
- Disclosure/checklists
  - Responsible NLP Research Checklist (mandatory): data, annotation, compute, environmental impact, bias/fairness, privacy, and release plans.
- Artifact adherence
  - Strong expectation of code and data release or a justified restriction statement.
  - Provide: code, templates/prompts, evaluation rubrics, annotation guidelines, decision‑rationales, and redaction tooling; scripts to obtain legal texts from legitimate sources.

AAAI
- Required/expected sections in paper
  - Ethical considerations section (risks, mitigations, broader impacts); human‑subjects compliance if applicable.
  - Data licensing/TOS adherence and privacy considerations.
- Disclosure/checklists
  - Reproducibility checklist (compute, datasets, parameters) when provided in the kit.
  - Disclosure of generative‑AI assistance in manuscript preparation if applicable.
- Artifact adherence
  - Code and data availability statements; at minimum, evaluation harness and dataset acquisition scripts.

KDD (and The Web Conference)
- Required/expected sections in paper
  - Responsible use and ethics section (legal compliance, privacy, bias); data governance and licensing; IRB if human‑in‑the‑loop.
  - Reproducibility and limitations.
- Disclosure/checklists
  - Reproducibility/Artifact track items if you opt in; conflicts and data sharing constraints disclosed.
- Artifact adherence
  - Code and data (or scripts), experiment configs, and logs sufficient to reproduce main results; if joining AE, containerized artifact and documentation.

Law‑specific additions to include in every venue’s ethics/compliance
- Legal scope and non‑advice disclaimer
  - State that the system is for research; not a substitute for licensed legal counsel; list prohibited uses (e.g., unsupervised deployment for legal decisions).
- Jurisdiction and coverage
  - Specify which jurisdictions and time spans your corpora cover; note inapplicability outside that scope; address post‑date drift in statutes/cases.
- Data provenance, licensing, and TOS
  - Enumerate sources (e.g., official court websites, Caselaw projects); include license/TOS terms; explicitly exclude proprietary sources (e.g., Westlaw/Lexis) unless you have rights and cannot redistribute.
- Privilege, confidentiality, and privacy
  - If any client‑lawyer or potentially privileged materials were used, describe de‑identification, redaction, and access controls; avoid sharing raw text; provide synthetic exemplars instead.
- Evaluation risk management
  - For human studies: qualifications (e.g., bar membership), instructions to avoid giving legal advice, compensation, consent, and debriefing; small‑cell suppression in reporting.
- Harm and fairness analyses
  - Risk of disparate performance across case types, jurisdictions, or litigant categories; measures taken (stratified metrics, error analyses).
- Safety/guardrails at inference
  - Refusal policies for requests seeking legal advice; retrieval provenance display; citation verification steps.

Artifact adherence (what your package should contain for a law‑domain LLM)
- Code and configs
  - Training/inference scripts; prompt templates; retrieval/grounding pipelines; citation verification modules; evaluation harness for legal tasks (e.g., statute QA, case outcome classification).
- Data handling
  - Scripts to fetch legal texts from permitted sources; preprocessing and redaction pipelines; a dataset ledger (source, version/date, jurisdiction, license, URL/DOI); no redistribution of restricted texts.
- Human‑eval materials
  - Protocols, rubrics, consent scripts, qualification tests, adjudication guidelines; inter‑annotator agreement computation.
- Reproducibility
  - Exact seeds, hyperparameters, model versions; environment files (Conda/Docker); two one‑command scripts to reproduce core results; expected vs obtained with CIs.
- Documentation
  - Model card: legal scope, jurisdictions, training data classes, evaluation metrics, failure modes, responsible‑use and prohibited uses.
  - Data card(s): provenance, licenses, known limitations/biases.
  - Security/privacy: data retention policy; PII/privilege handling.
