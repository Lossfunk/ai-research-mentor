Great — I can build a venue-by-venue requirements map and turn it into a concrete submission plan with milestones. To tailor this precisely, I need two things:

- Your shortlist of target venues (e.g., NeurIPS 2025, ICLR 2026, ICML 2026, ACL 2025, CVPR 2026, KDD 2025, SIGIR 2025, CHI 2026) and which track if applicable (main vs. datasets/benchmarks/replicability/industry).
- Your current plan/timeline (even rough): expected draft date, when code/data will be ready, whether human subjects or proprietary data are involved, and any constraints (e.g., can’t release raw data).

What I will deliver once you confirm venues
- A compact matrix for each venue with:
  - Paper format: page limit for main text, references/supplement policies, template link, required sections (e.g., limitations, ethics).
  - Review model: double-blind vs single-blind; use of OpenReview; anonymity period rules.
  - Reproducibility and artifacts: code/data/model release expectations, artifact review/badging (e.g., ACM badges), checklists, licensing cautions, and typical compute/reviewer-run constraints.
  - Extra policies: dataset contributions, human subjects/IRB, copyright, third-party model/data restrictions.
  - Important dates and common pitfalls that cause desk rejection.
- A venue-adapted execution plan with milestones:
  - Manuscript structure matched to the template and page budget, with tasks to cut/fit.
  - Anonymization worklist (e.g., scrub metadata, anonymize repo, redact acknowledgments, handle self-citations safely).
  - Reproducibility package assembly (code, environment, seeds, small test artifact, instructions), and if relevant, an artifact-evaluation path (e.g., for ACM venues).
  - Data release pathway (legal/ethical checks, licensing, de-identification, synthetic/derived release if raw data can’t be shared).
  - Compliance checks (ethics statement, limitations, broader impacts or societal considerations if required).
  - Calendar of internal deadlines back from the submission date (draft freeze, figures pass, reproducibility dry-run, anonymization audit).

If you want me to proceed immediately, reply with 3–5 target venues and years. If you’re undecided, tell me your field and constraints (e.g., “computer vision with a new benchmark; willing to release code, but data is partially licensed”), and I’ll propose a sensible venue set and then do the mapping.
