Adapted cross-venue plan (meets the strictest overlapping constraints)

- Manuscript structure
  - Target 8–9 pages main text (tight writing for CVPR/ACL/EMNLP; expandable appendix for ICLR/NeurIPS).
  - Put full proofs/ablations/datasets details in appendix (ICLR-style single PDF) and/or anonymized supplementary (NeurIPS/CVPR/ICML).
  - Include ethics/responsibility statement and compute/environmental disclosures where applicable (AAAI, ACL/EMNLP).

- Anonymization
  - Remove identifying metadata (PDF properties, Git history, model cards) and scrub affiliations.
  - No external links that could deanonymize; provide an anonymized supplementary zip with all materials needed for verification (scripts, configs, model checkpoints with scrubbed metadata).

- Reproducibility
  - Complete the venue-specific checklist early (NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI; ACL’s Responsible NLP checklist for NLP).
  - Provide: dataset licenses, preprocessing scripts, training configs, seeds, hardware, software versions, wall-clock, budget, and failure modes.

- Code/data release
  - During review: provide a fully anonymized, self-contained artifact (zip with README; no network calls, no git submodules, no tracking pixels).
  - Post-acceptance: prepare a public repo with an archival release (tag + Zenodo DOI), a permissive license where allowed, and a reproducibility script for one main figure/table.

- Artifact badging (if aiming for KDD/WebConf/ACM venues)
  - Prepare to submit to Artifacts Available/Evaluated/Replicated tracks after acceptance (or in parallel if allowed). Align packaging to ACM badging criteria early.

- Submission packaging checklist
  - One-click reproduce script (CPU-friendly path where feasible).
  - Prebuilt environment (Conda/uv lockfile + Dockerfile; pin CUDA/cuDNN).
  - Minimal data sample + deterministic unit tests for core components.
  - Explicit data-use and privacy review; document any restricted data.

- Timeline (backward from submission)
  - T-6 weeks: lock scope, run main experiments with 3 seeds; draft checklists.
  - T-4 weeks: freeze results/figures; complete anonymized artifact; dry-run install on clean machine.
  - T-2 weeks: internal blind review; fix clarity; finalize ethics/checklists.
  - T-1 week: compliance pass for page limits/templates; rerun “fresh reproduce” on a teammate’s machine; archive artifact.
  - T-72 hours: PDF audit (fonts, margins), metadata scrub, final link removal, final spell/consistency pass.

Three concrete, falsifiable pre-submission experiments (to meet artifact/reproducibility standards)

1) Cross-seed stability test
   - Hypothesis: Main metric improvements hold across random seeds.
   - Variables: 5 random seeds; fixed data splits; fixed hyperparameters.
   - Metric: Mean ± std; paired bootstrap test vs. baseline; report effect size.
   - Expected outcome: Improvement remains significant at α=0.05; variance within ±X% of reported value.

2) Environment portability test
   - Hypothesis: Results reproduce within tolerance on a clean environment and across one alternate GPU/CPU.
   - Variables: Two environments (clean Docker/Conda on T4/CPU), same commit & data snapshot.
   - Metric: Absolute and relative deviations for the main table; total wall-clock; peak memory.
   - Expected outcome: Deviations ≤1% for deterministic pipelines or within pre-declared tolerance bands; wall-clock within 20% across GPUs of similar class.

3) Minimal-data/compute ablation
   - Hypothesis: A reduced configuration (≤25% data or epochs) preserves the qualitative ranking of methods.
   - Variables: Subsample ratios and training budget.
   - Metric: Rank correlation (Spearman ρ) with full-run results; time-to-first-result.
   - Expected outcome: ρ ≥ 0.8; enables fast verification path for reviewers and artifact evaluators.

Optional (for ACM badges/KDD): Third-party reproduction drill
   - Give the artifact (frozen zip + README) to an internal teammate unfamiliar with the project.
   - Success criterion: They can produce the primary figure in ≤4 hours on commodity hardware without contacting the authors.

Literature/standards anchors

- NeurIPS Paper Checklist (captures the current norm of reporting compute, hyperparameters, evaluation, and limitations) — https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist
- Responsible NLP Research Checklist (ACL/EMNLP) — https://aclrollingreview.org/responsible-nlp-checklist-appendices
- ACM Artifact Review and Badging (criteria for Available/Evaluated/Replicated that KDD/WebConf often adopt) — https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current

Key takeaways
- Write to the strictest overlapping constraints: 8–9 pages main text, double-blind, full reproducibility details, anonymized supplemental artifact.
- Complete the venue’s checklist early; it will surface missing details and reduce last-week risk.
- Package a clean, one-click artifact now; it pays off for reviews, camera-ready, and (optionally) ACM artifact badges.

If you tell me the two or three target venues you’re most likely to submit to, I’ll tailor page budgeting, checklist items, and your artifact packaging specifics (e.g., whether to embed appendix vs. separate supplement, and which checklist to include) to those venues precisely.
