I need to help you map venue-specific requirements to your research plan, but I'm missing crucial context about your situation. Let me gather the essentials first, then provide tailored guidance.

## Quick Intake

Before I can adapt your plan effectively, I need to know:

1. **Target venue(s)**: Which conference(s) or journal(s) are you targeting? (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, CVPR, ICLR, Nature, etc.)
2. **Current stage**: Where are you in the process?
   - Pre-writing (planning experiments)
   - First draft (have preliminary results)
   - Revision stage (responding to feedback)
   - Ready to submit (final checks)
3. **Your work type**: What are you submitting?
   - Empirical study with new method/model
   - Theoretical contribution
   - Dataset/benchmark paper
   - Position/analysis paper
   - Something else?
4. **Artifact status**: What do you currently have?
   - Code (clean/messy/none)
   - Data (proprietary/public/synthetic)
   - Models (trained/checkpoints available)
   - Computational constraints for reproducibility

## Immediate Next Steps (Pick One)

While you gather that information, here are three mutually exclusive 2-hour actions you can take right now:

**Option A – Venue reconnaissance** (if you have 2-3 candidate venues):
- Download author guidelines for each
- Check last year's accepted papers for artifact patterns
- Note page limits, supplementary material rules, anonymization requirements
- Create a comparison table

**Option B – Artifact audit** (if venue is decided but artifacts unclear):
- List every figure/table/claim in your draft or plan
- Mark which need code, data, or model releases to verify
- Identify what's missing vs. what exists but needs cleaning
- Estimate effort (hours) to make each artifact release-ready

**Option C – Backward planning** (if you have a submission deadline):
- Mark your deadline on a calendar
- Block out: writing (2 weeks), experiments (varies), artifact prep (1 week), buffer (3-5 days)
- Identify if timeline is feasible or if scope needs cutting

**Intuition**: Venue requirements aren't just bureaucratic—they encode what the community values (reproducibility, clarity, novelty type) and directly constrain your experimental scope and presentation strategy. Misalignment here causes last-minute scrambles or desk rejects.

**Why this is principled**: Effective researchers work backward from venue constraints early in the project lifecycle, not as a formatting afterthought. This approach is emphasized in research planning frameworks and submission best practices—knowing whether you have 8 vs. 12 pages, or whether code release is expected vs. optional, fundamentally shapes what experiments are feasible and how you allocate effort.

Once you provide the intake details, I'll give you:
- Specific page budgets and how to allocate them (main text vs. appendix vs. supplement)
- Anonymization checklist for your venue
- Artifact release expectations with effort estimates
- A concrete timeline adapted to your deadline
- Risk flags (e.g., "your dataset can't be released → need anonymization strategy")

**What's the target venue and your current stage?** That will let me make this immediately actionable.
