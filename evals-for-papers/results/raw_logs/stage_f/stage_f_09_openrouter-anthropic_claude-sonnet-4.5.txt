- [ ] Additional references
- [ ] Formatting tweaks
- [ ] Supplementary material updates

**Afternoon (4 hours): New Content (if required)**

**Common additions for graph foundation models:**

**1. Scalability analysis** (if reviewers asked)
```latex
\subsection{Scalability Analysis}

We analyze the computational complexity and memory requirements 
of our graph foundation model:

\textbf{Time complexity:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Message passing}: $O(|E| \cdot d)$ where $|E|$ is 
  number of edges, $d$ is hidden dimension
\item \textbf{Attention}: $O(|V|^2 \cdot d)$ for full graph, 
  $O(|V| \cdot k \cdot d)$ with $k$-hop neighborhoods
\item \textbf{Total per layer}: $O(|E| \cdot d + |V| \cdot k \cdot d)$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Memory complexity:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Node embeddings}: $O(|V| \cdot d)$
\item \textbf{Edge features}: $O(|E| \cdot d_e)$
\item \textbf{Attention weights}: $O(|V| \cdot k)$ (sparse storage)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Empirical scaling:} We evaluate on graphs of varying sizes:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Scaling behavior on synthetic graphs}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
Graph Size & Training Time & Memory (GB) & Throughput \\
\midrule
$10^4$ nodes & 2.3 min & 1.2 & 4.3k nodes/s \\
$10^5$ nodes & 18.7 min & 8.4 & 5.3k nodes/s \\
$10^6$ nodes & 3.2 hours & 42.1 & 4.8k nodes/s \\
$10^7$ nodes & OOM & - & - \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our model scales to graphs with millions of nodes on a single 
A100 GPU. For larger graphs, we recommend mini-batch training 
with neighborhood sampling (see Appendix C for details).
```

**2. Failure mode analysis** (if reviewers asked)
```latex
\subsection{Failure Mode Analysis}

We identify scenarios where our model underperforms:

\textbf{1. Extremely sparse graphs} ($|E| < |V|$):
- Performance degrades when average degree < 2
- Message passing has insufficient information flow
- Mitigation: Add virtual edges or use positional encodings

\textbf{2. Highly heterophilic graphs}:
- Accuracy drops 8-12\% on graphs where connected nodes 
  have different labels (e.g., Wikipedia networks)
- Our model assumes homophily (similar nodes connect)
- Mitigation: Use higher-order neighborhoods or heterophilic GNN layers

\textbf{3. Dynamic graphs with rapid changes}:
- Model trained on static snapshots
- Performance degrades when >20\% of edges change between snapshots
- Mitigation: Continual learning or temporal graph models

See Appendix D for detailed analysis and examples.
```

**3. Broader impacts** (if required by venue)
```latex
\section*{Broader Impacts}

\textbf{Positive impacts:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Enables graph-based applications in drug discovery, 
  social network analysis, and recommendation systems
\item Pre-trained models reduce computational costs for 
  downstream tasks (democratizes access)
\item Open-source release promotes reproducibility and 
  further research
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Potential negative impacts:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Privacy}: Graph models can leak sensitive 
  information through link prediction or node embeddings
  - Mitigation: We provide differential privacy training 
    option (see Appendix E)
\item \textbf{Bias}: Pre-training on biased graphs (e.g., 
  social networks) can amplify existing biases
  - Mitigation: We evaluate fairness metrics and provide 
    debiasing techniques
\item \textbf{Misuse}: Models could be used for surveillance 
  or manipulation in social networks
  - Mitigation: We include ethical guidelines in documentation
\item \textbf{Environmental cost}: Large-scale pre-training 
  consumes significant energy
  - Mitigation: We report carbon footprint and provide 
    smaller model variants
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendations for practitioners:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate fairness on your specific downstream task
\item Consider privacy implications before deploying on 
  sensitive graphs
\item Use smaller models when possible to reduce environmental impact
\item Follow ethical guidelines in our documentation
\end{itemize}
```

# Grammar check (using LanguageTool)
languagetool paper.tex > grammar_issues.txt

# Or use online tools:
# - Grammarly (paste text)
# - Hemingway Editor (readability)
# - ProWritingAid
```

**Task 2: Common issues for graph ML papers**

**Notation consistency:**
```latex
% Define notation clearly and use consistently

% In introduction or preliminaries:
\textbf{Notation:} We denote a graph as $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ 
where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of nodes and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of edges. 
Node features are denoted as $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}| \times d}$ 
where $d$ is the feature dimension. We use $\mathbf{h}_v^{(l)}$ to denote the 
hidden representation of node $v$ at layer $l$.

% Then use consistently throughout:
% ✓ Good: $\mathbf{h}_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\mathbf{W}^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_v^{(l)})$
% ✗ Bad:  $h_{v,l+1} = \sigma(W_l h_{v,l})$ (inconsistent notation)
```

**Terminology consistency:**
```latex
% Choose one term and stick with it:
% - "Graph neural network" or "GNN" (not both interchangeably)
% - "Pre-training" or "pretraining" (not both)
% - "Fine-tuning" or "finetuning" (not both)
% - "Node" or "vertex" (not both)
% - "Edge" or "link" (not both)

% Create a terminology table:
% Preferred term | Avoid
% Graph neural network (GNN) | Graph convolutional network (unless specific)
% Pre-training | Pretraining
% Fine-tuning | Finetuning
% Node | Vertex
% Edge | Link
% Molecular graph | Molecule (when referring to graph representation)
```

**Afternoon (3 hours): Proofreading Pass 2**

**Task 3: Read aloud**

- [ ] Read entire paper aloud (or use text-to-speech)
- [ ] Mark awkward sentences
- [ ] Note unclear transitions
- [ ] Identify repetitive phrases

**Task 4: Check for common writing issues**

```latex
% ✗ Avoid passive voice (when possible):
% Bad:  "The model was trained on 10 datasets."
% Good: "We trained the model on 10 datasets."

% ✗ Avoid vague quantifiers:
% Bad:  "Our model performs significantly better."
% Good: "Our model achieves 5.2% higher accuracy (p < 0.001)."

% ✗ Avoid overclaiming:
% Bad:  "Our model clearly outperforms all baselines."
% Good: "Our model outperforms all baselines on 7 out of 8 datasets."

% ✗ Avoid unnecessary jargon:
% Bad:  "We leverage a novel paradigm for graph representation learning."
% Good: "We propose a new method for learning graph representations."

% ✓ Use parallel structure:
% Bad:  "Our contributions are: (1) a new model, (2) we evaluate on 
%        8 datasets, (3) releasing code."
% Good: "Our contributions are: (1) a new model, (2) evaluation on 
%        8 datasets, (3) open-source code release."
```

**Evening (2 hours): Abstract and Introduction Polish**

**Task 5: Strengthen abstract**

```latex
\begin{abstract}
% Structure: Problem → Gap → Solution → Results → Impact

% ✗ Weak abstract:
% "Graph neural networks are important. We propose a new model. 
%  It works well on several datasets."

% ✓ Strong abstract:
Graph foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 
learning transferable representations across diverse graph-structured 
data. However, existing approaches are limited by (1) reliance on 
task-specific architectures and (2) lack of large-scale pre-training 
strategies tailored to graph data.

We propose \textbf{GraphFM}, a graph foundation model that combines 
self-supervised pre-training on 100M+ graphs with a flexible 
architecture that adapts to downstream tasks via prompt tuning. 
Our key innovations include: (1) a graph-aware masking strategy 
that preserves structural information, (2) a hierarchical attention 
mechanism that captures multi-scale patterns, and (3) a unified 
framework for node, edge, and graph-level tasks.

We evaluate GraphFM on 15 benchmarks spanning molecular property 
prediction, social network analysis, and knowledge graph reasoning. 
GraphFM achieves state-of-the-art results on 12/15 tasks, with 
an average improvement of 7.3\% over previous best methods. 
Notably, GraphFM requires 10× less labeled data to match the 
performance of task-specific models.

Code and pre-trained models: \url{https://github.com/yourlab/graphfm}
\end{abstract}
```

**Task 6: Strengthen introduction**

```latex
% Introduction structure:
% 1. Motivation (why is this problem important?)
% 2. Gap (what's missing in existing work?)
% 3. Solution (what do we propose?)
% 4. Contributions (what are the key innovations?)
% 5. Results preview (what did we achieve?)
% 6. Paper organization (optional)

% ✓ Strong opening paragraph:
Graph-structured data is ubiquitous, from molecular graphs in drug 
discovery \citep{stokes2020deep} to social networks in recommendation 
systems \citep{ying2018graph} to knowledge graphs in question 
answering \citep{yasunaga2021qa}. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have 
emerged as the dominant approach for learning on graphs, achieving 
state-of-the-art results across diverse applications 
\citep{kipf2017semi, veličković2018graph, xu2019how}. However, 
training GNNs from scratch requires large amounts of labeled data, 
which is expensive to obtain in many domains (e.g., molecular 
property prediction requires costly wet-lab experiments).

% ✓ Clear gap statement:
Recent work has explored pre-training GNNs on unlabeled graphs to 
learn transferable representations \citep{hu2020strategies, you2020graph}. 
However, existing approaches face two key limitations: (1) they rely 
on task-specific architectures that do not generalize across node, 
edge, and graph-level tasks, and (2) they use pre-training objectives 
(e.g., node attribute masking) that do not fully leverage the rich 
structural information in graphs.

% ✓ Clear solution statement:
In this work, we propose \textbf{GraphFM}, a graph foundation model 
that addresses these limitations through...

import graphfm
print(graphfm.__version__)  # Should print version number

# Test model loading
from graphfm import GraphFM
model = GraphFM(num_layers=12, hidden_dim=768)
print(f"Model parameters: {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()):,}")
```

## GPU Support

### Check CUDA Availability

```python
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")
print(f"GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
```

### Install PyTorch with CUDA

If CUDA is not available, install PyTorch with CUDA support:

```bash
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu118 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# For CUDA 12.1
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu121 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: ImportError: No module named 'torch_geometric'

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install torch-geometric torch-scatter torch-sparse
```

### Issue: CUDA out of memory

**Solution:**
- Reduce batch size in config file
- Use gradient accumulation
- Use smaller model variant (GraphFM-Small)

### Issue: Slow data loading

**Solution:**
- Increase number of workers: `num_workers=4` in DataLoader
- Use SSD for data storage
- Pre-process and cache graphs

# GraphFM-Base

GraphFM-Base is a graph foundation model pre-trained on 100M molecules 
from ZINC15. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular 
property prediction tasks.

## Model Description

- **Developed by**: Jane Smith (Stanford), John Doe (MIT), Alice Johnson (Google)
- **Model type**: Graph Transformer
- **Language(s)**: N/A (graph-structured data)
- **License**: CC-BY-4.0
- **Paper**: [Graph Foundation Models (NeurIPS 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX)
- **Code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/yourlab/graph-foundation-models)

## Intended Uses

### Direct Use

Fine-tune on downstream molecular property prediction tasks:
- Drug discovery
- Toxicity prediction
- Solubility prediction
- Bioactivity prediction

### Out-of-Scope Use

- Protein structure prediction (model trained on small molecules only)
- Large molecules (>50 atoms)
- Non-molecular graphs (social networks, knowledge graphs)

## How to Use

```python
from graphfm import GraphFM

# Load model
model = GraphFM.from_pretrained('yourlab/graphfm-base')

# Use for inference
embeddings = model(graph)
```

See [documentation](https://yourlab.github.io/graphfm) for more examples.

## Training Data

- **Dataset**: ZINC15 (100M molecules)
- **Preprocessing**: Molecules with 5-50 atoms, standard SMILES
- **Augmentation**: Random masking, edge dropping

## Training Procedure

### Pre-training

- **Objective**: Masked graph modeling + contrastive learning
- **Batch size**: 256
- **Learning rate**: 1e-4 (cosine decay)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Hardware**: 8× NVIDIA A100 (40GB)
- **Training time**: 7 days
- **Carbon footprint**: ~150 kg CO₂ (estimated)

### Fine-tuning

See [fine-tuning guide](https://yourlab.github.io/graphfm/finetuning) 
for recommended hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

### Benchmarks

Performance on MoleculeNet (test set, 5 seeds):

| Dataset | GraphFM-Base | Previous SOTA |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| BBBP | 74.3 ± 0.7 | 71.5 ± 0.9 |
| Tox21 | 79.1 ± 0.5 | 77.2 ± 0.6 |
| HIV | 80.2 ± 0.6 | 78.0 ± 0.8 |
| BACE | 85.1 ± 1.2 | 82.3 ± 1.5 |

See paper for full results.

## Limitations

- **Domain**: Trained on small organic molecules; may not generalize 
  to proteins, inorganic compounds, or large molecules
- **Data bias**: ZINC15 is biased toward drug-like molecules
- **Computational cost**: Requires GPU for inference (CPU is slow)
- **Interpretability**: Limited interpretability of learned representations

## Ethical Considerations

### Positive Impacts

- Accelerates drug discovery
- Reduces need for animal testing
- Democratizes access to molecular ML (pre-trained models)

### Negative Impacts

- Could be misused to design harmful compounds (toxins, drugs of abuse)
- May perpetuate biases in training data (e.g., focus on Western diseases)
- Environmental cost of training (150 kg CO₂)

### Recommendations

- Use responsibly and follow ethical guidelines
- Evaluate on your specific use case before deployment
- Consider fairness and bias implications
- Report misuse to authors

property prediction! 

📄 Paper: [link]
💻 Code: [link]
🤗 Models: [link]

Key results: 7.3% improvement over SOTA, 10× less labeled data needed

Thread 🧵👇

1/5 Problem: Training GNNs from scratch requires lots of labeled data, 
which is expensive in domains like drug discovery.

2/5 Solution: GraphFM pre-trains on 100M unlabeled molecules, then 
fine-tunes on downstream tasks with minimal labels.

3/5 Results: SOTA on 12/15 benchmarks. On BBBP, we achieve 74.3% 
accuracy (vs. 71.5% previous best).

4/5 We're releasing:
✅ Pre-trained models (Small, Base, Large)
✅ Code and data
✅ Tutorials and docs

All open-source (MIT license)!

5/5 Try it yourself:
pip install graph-foundation-models

Huge thanks to my co-authors @JohnDoe @AliceJohnson and our reviewers!
