**Review Period**: Post-initial submission, pre-rebuttal

---

## 📊 REVIEWER #1 (Champion) — Score: 7/10 (Accept)

### Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark for federated learning algorithms across diverse datasets and heterogeneity settings. The authors evaluate 12 FL methods on 8 datasets with systematic variations in data distribution, client participation, and communication constraints. The benchmark infrastructure is well-designed and the experimental methodology is rigorous.

### Strengths

**S1. Comprehensive experimental scope** ⭐⭐⭐
- Evaluates 12 FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedNova, FedOpt variants, etc.) across multiple dimensions
- Tests 8 datasets spanning vision (CIFAR-10/100, FEMNIST), NLP (Shakespeare, StackOverflow), and medical imaging (ISIC, CheXpert)
- Systematic variation of heterogeneity (α ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0} for Dirichlet distribution)
- Clear presentation of results with statistical significance testing

**S2. Rigorous experimental methodology** ⭐⭐⭐
- Multiple runs (5 seeds) with confidence intervals reported
- Consistent hyperparameter tuning protocol across all methods
- Fair comparison: same computational budget, same model architectures
- Ablation studies isolate effects of data heterogeneity, client sampling, and communication rounds

**S3. Practical insights and recommendations** ⭐⭐
- Section 5 provides actionable guidance: "Use FedProx for high heterogeneity (α < 0.5), FedAvg for mild heterogeneity"
- Analysis of communication-accuracy tradeoffs is valuable for practitioners
- Discussion of failure modes (e.g., SCAFFOLD divergence with high client dropout) is honest and useful

**S4. Reproducibility commitment** ⭐⭐
- Authors commit to releasing code, datasets, and trained models
- Detailed hyperparameter tables in appendix
- Clear description of experimental setup (hardware, runtime)

### Weaknesses

**W1. Limited novelty in methodology** ⚠️ MAJOR
- The paper is primarily an empirical study; no new FL algorithms or theoretical contributions
- Benchmark design follows standard practices (Dirichlet distribution for non-IID, random client sampling)
- While comprehensive, the experimental setup is not fundamentally different from prior benchmarks (e.g., LEAF, FedML)
- **Impact on score**: This is acceptable for a benchmark paper, but limits novelty claims

**W2. Missing recent baselines** ⚠️ MAJOR
- Several important recent methods are missing:
  - **FedDyn** (ICLR 2021): Dynamic regularization for heterogeneous data
  - **MOON** (CVPR 2021): Model-contrastive learning
  - **FedGen** (NeurIPS 2021): Generative model-based FL
  - **FedLC** (ICML 2022): Label-aware client selection
  - **FedSpeed** (MLSys 2023): Asynchronous FL
- Authors should justify baseline selection or add these methods
- **Rebuttal action**: Explain selection criteria OR commit to adding 2-3 key missing methods

**W3. Incomplete heterogeneity modeling** ⚠️ MODERATE
- Paper focuses on label distribution skew (Dirichlet) but ignores:
  - **Feature distribution shift**: Different input distributions across clients
  - **Quantity skew**: Highly imbalanced client dataset sizes (beyond uniform sampling)
  - **Temporal skew**: Clients with different data arrival patterns
  - **Concept drift**: Changing data distributions over time
- Real-world FL often exhibits multiple heterogeneity types simultaneously
- **Rebuttal action**: Acknowledge limitation OR add experiments with combined heterogeneity

**W4. Limited scalability analysis** ⚠️ MODERATE
- Experiments use 10-100 clients, but real FL deployments have 1000s-millions (e.g., mobile keyboards)
- No analysis of how methods scale with client count
- Communication costs reported in "rounds" but not actual bytes transferred
- **Rebuttal action**: Add scalability experiments OR discuss extrapolation from current results

### Questions for Authors

**Q1**: How were hyperparameters tuned for each method? Was there a validation set, or did you use the test set (which would be problematic)?

**Q2**: For FedProx, you report μ=0.01. Did you try other values (0.001, 0.1, 1.0)? This is a critical hyperparameter.

**Q3**: Table 3 shows SCAFFOLD outperforms FedAvg on CIFAR-10 (α=0.1), but Figure 4 suggests the opposite. Can you clarify this discrepancy?

**Q4**: You mention "communication-efficient" methods but don't evaluate compression techniques (gradient quantization, sparsification). Why not?

**Q5**: What is the computational cost of your benchmark? How long does it take to run all experiments?

### Missing Artifacts (Critical for Acceptance)

**A1. Code repository** 🔴 REQUIRED
- Authors state "code will be released" but provide no link for review
- Reviewers cannot verify experimental setup or reproduce results
- **Action**: Provide anonymous GitHub link in rebuttal

**A2. Hyperparameter configurations** 🔴 REQUIRED
- Appendix has partial hyperparameters, but missing:
  - Learning rate schedules (constant? decay?)
  - Batch sizes for each dataset
  - Client sampling strategy details
  - Optimizer settings (momentum, weight decay)
- **Action**: Add complete hyperparameter table

**A3. Statistical significance details** 🟡 RECOMMENDED
- Confidence intervals shown in figures, but no p-values or effect sizes
- Which differences are statistically significant?
- **Action**: Add significance tests (t-test, Wilcoxon) to main comparisons

### Recommendation
**Accept** — This is a solid empirical contribution that will be valuable to the FL community. The experimental scope is impressive and the methodology is generally sound. However, the authors must address the missing baselines and provide code/hyperparameters for reproducibility. I would raise my score to 8 if these issues are resolved in the rebuttal.

**Confidence**: 4/5 (Quite confident)

---

## 📊 REVIEWER #2 (Positive Leaning) — Score: 6/10 (Weak Accept)

### Summary
The paper presents a benchmark for federated learning with experiments across multiple datasets and heterogeneity settings. While the scope is broad, I have concerns about the experimental design, missing analysis, and limited discussion of practical deployment considerations.

### Strengths

**S1. Diverse dataset coverage** ⭐⭐
- Includes vision, NLP, and medical imaging datasets
- Medical datasets (ISIC, CheXpert) are particularly relevant for real-world FL applications
- Good mix of image classification and language modeling tasks

**S2. Clear presentation** ⭐⭐
- Figures are well-designed and easy to interpret
- Tables are comprehensive
- Writing is generally clear

**S3. Honest discussion of limitations** ⭐
- Section 6 acknowledges simulation vs. real deployment gap
- Authors note that privacy/security aspects are out of scope

### Weaknesses

**W1. Questionable experimental choices** ⚠️ MAJOR
- **Client sampling**: Authors use uniform random sampling, but real FL systems use availability-based sampling (clients may be offline, have limited battery, etc.)
- **Communication model**: Assumes synchronous rounds with no stragglers, which is unrealistic
- **System heterogeneity**: All clients assumed to have same compute/memory, but real devices vary widely (phone vs. laptop vs. IoT)
- These simplifications may invalidate conclusions for real deployments
- **Rebuttal action**: Justify simplifications OR add experiments with realistic system constraints

**W2. Insufficient analysis of results** ⚠️ MAJOR
- Paper presents many results but limited insight into *why* certain methods work better
- Example: Why does FedProx outperform FedAvg on FEMNIST but not CIFAR-100? No hypothesis or analysis
- Missing: Feature visualization, gradient analysis, loss landscape analysis
- **Rebuttal action**: Add deeper analysis of at least 1-2 key findings

**W3. Privacy and security ignored** ⚠️ MODERATE
- Title says "benchmark" but only evaluates accuracy/communication
- No evaluation of privacy (differential privacy, secure aggregation overhead)
- No evaluation of robustness to attacks (poisoning, backdoors, inference attacks)
- These are critical for real FL deployments
- **Rebuttal action**: Acknowledge as limitation OR add privacy/security experiments

**W4. Limited practical guidance** ⚠️ MODERATE
- Section 5 recommendations are too simplistic: "Use FedProx for high heterogeneity"
- Real practitioners need guidance on:
  - How to estimate heterogeneity level in their data?
  - How to choose hyperparameters without centralized validation set?
  - When is FL worth the complexity vs. centralized training?
- **Rebuttal action**: Expand practical recommendations with decision trees or guidelines

**W5. Reproducibility concerns** ⚠️ MODERATE
- No code provided for review (only promise to release)
- Some experimental details missing:
  - How were datasets partitioned across clients? (Random? By user ID?)
  - What happens when client has <1 sample per class?
  - How were train/val/test splits handled in federated setting?
- **Rebuttal action**: Provide code OR add detailed experimental protocol appendix

### Questions for Authors

**Q1**: How do your results change with different client sampling strategies (e.g., biased sampling, availability-based)?

**Q2**: Did you evaluate personalization methods (FedPer, Ditto, pFedMe)? These are important for heterogeneous settings.

**Q3**: For medical datasets (ISIC, CheXpert), did you simulate realistic hospital-based partitioning (each hospital = client)? Or random partitioning?

**Q4**: Table 2 shows FedAvg achieves 94.2% on CIFAR-10 (IID), but centralized training typically gets 95%+. Why the gap?

**Q5**: You mention "communication rounds" but how many total samples are communicated? Bytes transferred?

**Q6**: How sensitive are results to the number of local epochs (E)? You use E=5, but what about E=1 or E=10?

### Missing Artifacts

**A1. Code and data partitioning scripts** 🔴 CRITICAL
- Cannot verify experimental setup without code
- Data partitioning is crucial for FL benchmarks
- **Action**: Provide anonymous repository

**A2. Trained model checkpoints** 🟡 RECOMMENDED
- Would allow community to build on your work
- Useful for transfer learning experiments
- **Action**: Upload to Hugging Face or Zenodo

**A3. Detailed experimental logs** 🟡 RECOMMENDED
- Per-round accuracy, loss, communication cost
- Would enable deeper analysis by community
- **Action**: Provide as supplementary CSV files

### Recommendation
**Weak Accept** — The paper makes a useful contribution by providing a comprehensive benchmark, but the experimental design has significant limitations that reduce practical applicability. The lack of code during review is concerning for reproducibility. I would increase my score to 7 if authors provide code and address the experimental design concerns.

**Confidence**: 3/5 (Moderately confident)

**Day 3-4: Novelty Clarification**
```markdown
## Novelty vs. Existing Benchmarks

We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. Below 
we compare our benchmark to existing work:

| Feature | LEAF | FedML | FLSim | Ours |
|---------|------|-------|-------|------|
| # Methods | 3 | 8 | 6 | 12 |
| # Datasets | 6 | 4 | 3 | 8 |
| Medical imaging | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (ISIC, CheXpert) |
| Heterogeneity levels | 2 | 1 | 2 | 4 (α ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0}) |
| Statistical testing | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (5 seeds, CI) |
| Communication analysis | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (extended in rebuttal) |
| Fairness metrics | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (added in rebuttal) |

Our unique contributions:

   real-world FL applications)
2. Systematic heterogeneity analysis with 4 levels
3. Rigorous statistical testing (5 seeds, confidence intervals)
4. [NEW] Multi-dimensional evaluation (accuracy, communication, 
   fairness) — see updated results below
```

**Day 5-6: Hyperparameter Tuning Protocol**
```markdown
## Hyperparameter Tuning Protocol

We apologize for the lack of clarity. Our tuning protocol was:

1. **Validation set**: For each dataset, we reserved 10% of 
   training data as a federated validation set (distributed 
   across clients with same heterogeneity as training data).

2. **Tuning process**: For each method, we performed grid search 
   over key hyperparameters:
   - Learning rate: {0.001, 0.01, 0.1}
   - Local epochs: {1, 5, 10}
   - Method-specific (e.g., FedProx μ: {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0})

3. **Selection**: We selected hyperparameters that achieved best 
   validation accuracy after 100 communication rounds.

4. **Final evaluation**: We retrained with selected hyperparameters 
   and evaluated on test set (reported in paper).

We have added Appendix B with complete hyperparameter tables for 
all methods and datasets.
```

**Day 7: Add Missing Baselines**
```markdown
## Additional Baselines

We have added 5 important baselines requested by reviewers:

1. **FedDyn** (ICLR 2021): Dynamic regularization
2. **MOON** (CVPR 2021): Model-contrastive learning
3. **FedPer** (NeurIPS 2020): Personalized FL
4. **Ditto** (ICML 2021): Personalized FL with fairness
5. **FedGen** (NeurIPS 2021): Generative model-based FL

Results summary (CIFAR-10, α=0.1):
- FedDyn: 87.3% (±0.6) — competitive with FedProx
- MOON: 88.1% (±0.5) — best performance
- FedPer: 85.2% (±0.7) — lower global accuracy but better 
  personalized accuracy (see new Table 5)
- Ditto: 86.8% (±0.6) — good fairness (see new Figure 7)
- FedGen: 84.5% (±0.9) — struggles with high heterogeneity

Full results in updated Table 3 and new Appendix C.
```

### Week 2: Address Important Issues

**Day 8-9: Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**
```markdown
## Extended Evaluation Metrics

We have added the following metrics (new Section 4.3):

1. **Communication efficiency**: Rounds to reach 80% of final 
   accuracy (Table 6)
   - FedAvg: 120 rounds
   - FedProx: 95 rounds (21% faster)
   - SCAFFOLD: 75 rounds (38% faster)

2. **Fairness**: Variance of per-client accuracy (Figure 7)
   - FedAvg: σ²=12.3
   - Ditto: σ²=4.7 (62% more fair)

3. **Robustness**: Performance under 30% client dropout (Table 7)
   - FedAvg: -8.2% accuracy
   - FedProx: -3.1% accuracy (more robust)

These results provide actionable insights for practitioners.
```

**Day 10-11: Deeper Analysis**
```markdown
## Analysis of Key Findings

We have added Section 5.2 with deeper analysis:

**Finding 1**: FedProx outperforms FedAvg on FEMNIST but not CIFAR-100

Analysis: FEMNIST has higher heterogeneity (naturally partitioned 
by writer) compared to CIFAR-100 (artificially partitioned). 
FedProx's proximal term prevents divergence in high heterogeneity 
settings. We verified this by plotting gradient diversity (new 
Figure 8): FEMNIST has 3.2× higher gradient variance than CIFAR-100.

**Finding 2**: SCAFFOLD achieves best communication efficiency 
but high variance

Analysis: SCAFFOLD uses control variates to reduce gradient 
variance, enabling larger learning rates. However, it's sensitive 
to client sampling: with 10% sampling, control variates are noisy. 
We added experiments with 20% sampling (new Table 8): variance 
drops from ±3.2% to ±1.1%.

[Additional findings...]
```

**Day 12-13: Complete Hyperparameters**
```markdown
## Complete Hyperparameter Configurations

We have added Appendix B with full hyperparameter tables for all 
methods and datasets. Example:

**CIFAR-10 (α=0.1)**
| Method | LR | Local Epochs | Batch Size | Optimizer | Special Params |
|--------|----|--------------|-----------|-----------| ---------------|
| FedAvg | 0.01 | 5 | 32 | SGD (momentum=0.9) | - |
| FedProx | 0.01 | 5 | 32 | SGD (momentum=0.9) | μ=0.01 |
| SCAFFOLD | 0.05 | 5 | 32 | SGD (momentum=0.9) | - |
| FedNova | 0.01 | 5 | 32 | SGD (momentum=0.9) | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Full tables for all 8 datasets in Appendix B.

We have also uploaded configuration files (YAML format) to our 
GitHub repository for exact reproducibility.
```

**Day 14: Statistical Significance**
```markdown
## Statistical Significance Testing

We have added statistical significance tests to all main comparisons:

**Table 3 (updated)**: Accuracy on CIFAR-10 (α=0.1)
| Method | Accuracy | vs. FedAvg (p-value) |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| FedAvg | 85.2 ± 0.7 | - |
| FedProx | 87.3 ± 0.6 | p < 0.001 *** |
| SCAFFOLD | 88.9 ± 0.5 | p < 0.001 *** |
| FedNova | 86.1 ± 0.8 | p = 0.042 * |
| MOON | 88.1 ± 0.5 | p < 0.001 *** |

*** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05 (two-tailed t-test)

All statistically significant differences are now marked in tables.
