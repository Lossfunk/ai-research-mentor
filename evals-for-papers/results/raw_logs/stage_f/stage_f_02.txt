I'd be happy to help you check for ethics and compliance risks in your paper! However, I don't see any attached document yet.

**Could you please upload your paper (PDF or draft)?** Once you do, I'll systematically review it for:

1. **Dataset licenses & attribution** - proper citations, license compatibility, terms of use
2. **Human data handling** - IRB approval, consent, privacy protections, demographic reporting
3. **Compute & environmental disclosures** - carbon footprint, resource usage, reproducibility details
4. **Broader impacts** - dual-use concerns, fairness considerations, limitation statements
5. **Author & funding transparency** - COI statements, acknowledgments

**While you're uploading, quick intake questions to tailor my review:**

1. **Venue target?** (Different venues have different requirements - NeurIPS has a broader impact statement requirement, ACL has ethics review criteria, etc.)
2. **Does your work involve any of these?**
   - Scraping web data or using datasets assembled from user-generated content
   - Human annotations, crowdworkers, or user studies
   - Models trained on >100 GPU-hours
   - Sensitive domains (medical, legal, children, surveillance)
3. **Geographic context?** (GDPR in EU, specific IRB requirements in your institution, etc.)

**Intuition**: Ethics compliance has shifted from optional "broader impacts" to mandatory gating criteria at major venues. Reviewers now actively flag missing disclosures, and desk-rejects for ethics violations are increasingly common.

**Why this is principled**: Reproducibility standards (Papers with Code, ML Reproducibility Checklist), data governance frameworks (GDPR, dataset datasheets), and venue-specific ethics policies now form a compliance baseline that protects both subjects and scientific integrity.

Upload your draft and I'll give you a concrete checklist with page-specific fixes! 📄
