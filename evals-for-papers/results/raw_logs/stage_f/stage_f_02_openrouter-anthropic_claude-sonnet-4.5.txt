I don't see any paper attached to your message. To check your paper for ethics and compliance risks, I'll need you to upload the document (PDF, LaTeX, or Word format).

Once you attach your paper, I can analyze it for:

## **What I'll Check For:**

### **1. Dataset Compliance**
- Dataset names, versions, and licenses mentioned
- Proper citations for datasets used
- Commercial vs. research-only license conflicts
- Data preprocessing/filtering disclosures
- Train/test contamination risks (especially for LLMs)

### **2. Human Data & Privacy**
- Use of human-generated data (annotations, evaluations)
- IRB approval or exemption statements
- Informed consent procedures
- PII handling and anonymization
- Crowdworker compensation disclosure

### **3. Compute & Environmental Disclosures**
- Hardware specifications (GPU types, counts)
- Training/compression time reported
- Energy consumption or carbon footprint estimates
- Computational budget transparency
- Reproducibility information (random seeds, hyperparameters)

### **4. Model & Code Artifacts**
- Pretrained model sources and licenses
- Code availability statements
- Model release plans and safety considerations
- Dependency documentation

### **5. Broader Impact & Limitations**
- Dual-use concerns (especially for LLM compression enabling wider deployment)
- Failure cases and scope limitations
- Bias and fairness considerations
- Societal impact discussion

### **6. Venue-Specific Requirements**
- Checklist completeness (NeurIPS/ICML/ACL style)
- Anonymization for double-blind review
- Formatting compliance with ethics sections

**Please upload your paper**, and I'll provide:
1. ✅ **Compliant items** (what you're doing right)
2. ⚠️ **Risk areas** (what needs attention)
3. 🔧 **Specific fixes** (exact text suggestions and where to add them)
4. 📋 **Checklist** (venue-specific requirements you may have missed)

I can review drafts, camera-ready versions, or even just your methods/experiments sections if the full paper isn't ready yet.
