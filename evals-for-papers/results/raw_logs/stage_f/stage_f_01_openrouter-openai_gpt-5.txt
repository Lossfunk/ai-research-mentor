Here are strong venue options for a 6‑month project on compressible LLMs, with fit, ethics requirements, and formatting constraints summarized. I also include a brief simulated reviewer summary and concrete experiments you can run to de‑risk the submission.

Top venues and constraints

- NeurIPS (general ML; strong home for compression)
  - Fit: Top‑tier for methods advancing efficiency/quantization/pruning with solid empirical rigor.
  - Ethics: Must comply with Ethics Guidelines and use the NeurIPS Paper Checklist; submissions may be flagged for dedicated ethics review when appropriate [2][3]. 
  - Formatting: Follow the official Call for Papers for template and length limits (historically strict page limits for main text, references unlimited; check current year to avoid desk rejection) [1].

- ICML (general ML; rigorous empirical standards)
  - Fit: Competitive for compression algorithms with theory/analysis or broad generalization across tasks/models.
  - Ethics: Publication Ethics policy; reproducibility expectations, commonly using the Pineau Reproducibility Checklist [5][6].
  - Formatting: Follow ICML Author Instructions (template, length and anonymity rules) [4].

- ICLR (general ML; open review; favors clarity of empirical claims)
  - Fit: Suitable for clear ablations and “what works” analyses of LLM compression under constrained resources.
  - Ethics: Must adhere to ICLR Code of Ethics [8].
  - Formatting: See the ICLR Author Guide for templates and submission requirements [7].

- MLSys (systems+ML; ideal if you measure hardware/runtime/energy)
  - Fit: Strong if you provide system‑level evidence (latency/throughput/energy) and practical deployment considerations.
  - Ethics: Follows standard conference ethics; emphasize reproducibility and resource accounting.
  - Formatting: See the MLSys Call for Papers for templates, limits, and artifact expectations [13].

- ACL/EMNLP via ARR (if the work is NLP‑centric and includes safety/bias analysis)
  - Fit: If your compression focuses on text tasks and you evaluate safety/bias and linguistic performance, consider ARR → ACL/EMNLP/Findings.
  - Ethics: Responsible NLP Checklist is required as an appendix for many ACL venues; papers may receive focused ethics review [9][10].
  - Formatting: Use ACL templates and ARR author guidelines; strict page limits and appendix rules apply [9][11][12].

- TMLR (rolling review; good for 6‑month runway)
  - Fit: Fast, rigorous venue to get a method validated; open reviews can help refine the work before a later conference version.
  - Ethics/Formatting: See TMLR author guide for templates, ethics, open‑review process, and reproducibility expectations [14].

- JMLR (journal; archival, slower)
  - Fit: Consider only if you’re aiming for a long‑form archival version; timeline often exceeds 6 months.
  - Ethics/Formatting: See JMLR author info for policies and formatting; no hard page limits but high bar for completeness [15].

Pragmatic 6‑month strategy

- If you want the fastest credible path: TMLR within ~3–4 months, then revise for the next suitable conference (ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS/MLSys) after incorporating reviews [14].
- If you want a conference first: align your experiments with NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR checklists and ethics policies early (compute budget reporting, dataset licenses, safety/bias evaluation) [1][3][4][5][6][7][8]. For NLP‑centric work, consider ARR to target EMNLP/ACL/Findings with the Responsible NLP Checklist appendix [9][10][11][12].
- If you emphasize systems: prioritize MLSys and include strong runtime/energy and hardware‑aware analyses [13].

Concrete, falsifiable experiments (design to satisfy reproducibility/ethics checklists)

- Accuracy–compression frontier across families and tasks
  - Hypothesis: Method M preserves task accuracy better than strong baselines at the same memory/latency budget.
  - Setup: Apply M vs. AWQ/QLoRA/SparseGPT baselines on at least two base models (e.g., 7B and 13B) across standard evals (MMLU, ARC‑C, GSM8K). Fix training tokens and hyperparameters; report seeds.
  - Metrics: Accuracy/pass@k, memory footprint, tokens/sec; acceptance criterion: statistically no worse than baseline at ≥20% extra compression.

- Robustness and calibration under compression
  - Hypothesis: M degrades calibration and robustness less than baselines at fixed perplexity.
  - Setup: Evaluate ECE/Brier scores and OOD robustness (e.g., shifting from wikipedia QA to news‑style QA); include adversarial paraphrases.
  - Metrics: ECE, worst‑case accuracy drop; acceptance criterion: M’s calibration error ≤ baseline at same perplexity.

- Safety and bias deltas pre/post compression
  - Hypothesis: Compression does not increase toxicity or demographic bias beyond a small threshold.
  - Setup: Measure RealToxicityPrompts toxicity rates, bias probes (e.g., CrowS‑Pairs), and refusal behavior before vs. after compression.
  - Metrics: Toxicity rate, bias score deltas; acceptance criterion: ≤1–2% absolute increase vs. base model, or mitigations demonstrated. Ensure ethics discussion and risk mitigations to meet venue policies [2][5][8][10].

- System‑level efficiency with compute accounting
  - Hypothesis: M improves end‑to‑end throughput and energy proportional to compression ratio on commodity GPUs.
  - Setup: Measure latency/throughput/energy on A100 and consumer GPUs using a fixed prompt distribution; report CO2 estimates and hardware details to satisfy checklists [3][6][13].
  - Metrics: Tokens/sec, Joules/token; acceptance criterion: ≥X% speedup and ≥Y% energy reduction over strongest baseline at equal accuracy.

Simulated reviewer summary (conference‑style, ~150 words)

- Summary: The paper proposes Method M, a post‑training compression approach combining group‑wise quantization with structure‑aware sparsity for LLMs. The authors evaluate on two model sizes (7B/13B) and three benchmarks, reporting improved accuracy at comparable memory budgets and 1.6–2.1× speedups on A100 and RTX 4090.
- Strengths: Clear ablations disentangling quantization vs. sparsity effects; thorough reporting of compute, seeds, and code; safety/bias deltas are measured with mitigation steps; competitive against AWQ and QLoRA on MMLU and GSM8K.
- Weaknesses: Limited generality (mostly English tasks); robustness under
