### **Tier 3: Faster Turnaround / Specialized**

6. **AAAI 2025** (Association for Advancement of AI)
   - **Timeline fit**: August deadline (already passed for 2025, but AAAI-26 in Aug 2025)
   - **Relevance**: Broad AI venue accepting compression work
   - **Ethics**: Ethics and societal impact review
   - **Format**: 7 pages + 1 page references; AAAI Press style
   - **Why**: Faster review cycle; broad audience

- Limitations and failure cases
- Broader societal impact (especially for LLMs)
- Code/model release plans (reproducibility)

## **Simulated Reviewer Summary**

**Paper**: *Efficient Compression of Large Language Models via Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition*

### **Reviewer #1 (NeurIPS-style)**

**Summary of Contributions:**
The paper proposes an adaptive low-rank decomposition method for compressing LLMs, achieving 3.2× compression on LLaMA-7B with <2% perplexity degradation. The key novelty is layer-wise rank allocation based on sensitivity analysis.

**Strengths:**
- Strong empirical results across 3 model families (LLaMA, OPT, GPT-2)
- Thorough ablation studies on rank selection strategies
- Computational cost analysis included (Table 3)
- Code release promised; reproducibility checklist complete

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited theoretical justification for the sensitivity metric (Eq. 4)
- Comparison missing against recent GPTQ and AWQ baselines
- Evaluation only on perplexity; downstream task performance needed
- Broader impact statement lacks discussion of deployment energy savings vs. retraining costs

**Questions:**
1. How does compression time scale with model size beyond 7B parameters?
2. Can the method combine with quantization for further gains?
3. What happens to compression ratio on domain-specific fine-tuned models?

**Ethical Concerns:**
Minor - should discuss potential for compressed models to enable wider deployment of potentially harmful LLMs.

**Recommendation:** Weak Accept (6/10)
*The empirical work is solid but needs stronger baselines and theoretical grounding. Downstream evaluation is critical for acceptance.*

### **Reviewer #2 (ACL-style)**

**Summary:**
This work introduces adaptive rank selection for tensor decomposition in LLM compression, evaluated on standard language modeling benchmarks.

**Soundness:** 3/5 (good)
**Contribution:** 3/5 (good)  
**Presentation:** 4/5 (excellent)

**Strengths:**
+ Clear writing and well-structured paper
+ Addresses important problem (LLM deployment efficiency)
+ Limitations section is honest about scope

**Weaknesses:**
- No evaluation on actual NLP tasks (QA, summarization, etc.) - perplexity alone insufficient
- Missing comparison to distillation-based compression
- Hyperparameter sensitivity not fully explored
- Computational cost of sensitivity analysis itself not reported

**Required Changes:**
1. Add at least 3 downstream tasks from GLUE or similar
2. Compare against knowledge distillation baseline
3. Expand limitations to discuss when method fails

**Ethics/Reproducibility:**
✓ Limitations section present  
✓ Computational resources documented  
⚠ Dataset details adequate but could specify exact preprocessing  
✓ Code release planned

**Recommendation:** Borderline Accept
*Conditional on adding downstream task evaluation in revision.*

### **Reviewer #3 (ICML-style)**

**Summary:**
Adaptive low-rank compression for LLMs using layer-wise sensitivity.

**Score:** 6 (Marginally above acceptance threshold)

**Justification:**
The paper makes a reasonable contribution to practical LLM compression. The sensitivity-based rank allocation is intuitive and shows empirical gains. However, the theoretical novelty is limited - the approach is largely an engineering combination of existing techniques. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive within its scope but misses key comparisons (GPTQ, SparseGPT) that are state-of-art in this space.

**Pros:**
- Well-executed experiments with proper error bars
- Ablation studies are thorough
- Writing is clear

**Cons:**
- Incremental novelty over prior low-rank methods
- Missing SOTA baselines from 2023-2024
- No analysis of what linguistic capabilities are preserved/lost
- Societal impact statement is generic

**Suggestions:**
- Position as empirical study rather than novel method
- Add qualitative analysis of generation quality
- Benchmark against very recent compression work

**Confidence:** 4/5

## **Key Takeaways for Your Submission**

1. **Choose venue based on emphasis**: NeurIPS/ICML if algorithmic novelty is strong; ACL/EMNLP if LLM-specific evaluation is thorough
2. **Must-haves for acceptance**:
   - Comparison against 2023-2024 SOTA (GPTQ, AWQ, SparseGPT for compression)
   - Downstream task evaluation beyond perplexity
   - Computational cost transparency
   - Honest limitations section
3. **Ethics checklist items**:
   - Report training/compression carbon footprint
   - Discuss dual-use concerns for efficient LLM deployment
   - Document datasets and licenses
   - Plan for code/model release

**Recommended primary target**: **NeurIPS 2025** (if ready by May/June) or **EMNLP 2025** (if you need until May/June and have strong NLP evaluations)
