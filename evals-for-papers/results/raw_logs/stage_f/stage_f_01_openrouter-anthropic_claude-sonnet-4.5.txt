## Simulated Reviewer Summary

### Paper: "Adaptive Low-Rank Compression for Large Language Models"

**Reviewer #1 (Champion) - Score: 7/10 (Accept)**

*Strengths:*
- Novel adaptive rank selection mechanism shows consistent 2-3x compression with <1% perplexity degradation across LLaMA and GPT-style models
- Strong empirical evaluation on 5 downstream tasks (GLUE, SuperGLUE subsets)
- Ablation studies clearly demonstrate the contribution of each component
- Code and checkpoints promised upon acceptance

*Weaknesses:*
- Limited theoretical analysis of why adaptive rank selection outperforms fixed-rank methods
- Comparison with recent quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ) missing
- Computational cost of rank selection during compression not thoroughly analyzed

*Questions:*
- How does the method perform on models >70B parameters?
- Can this be combined with quantization for multiplicative gains?

**Recommendation**: Accept. Solid empirical contribution with practical impact, though theoretical grounding could be stronger.

---

**Reviewer #2 (Positive Leaning) - Score: 6/10 (Weak Accept)**

*Strengths:*
- Well-motivated problem with clear practical applications
- Writing is clear and figures are informative
- Ethics statement appropriately addresses energy consumption benefits

*Weaknesses:*
- Novelty is incremental—builds heavily on existing SVD-based compression without sufficient differentiation
- Missing comparisons with LoRA fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient methods
- Inference speedup claims (Table 3) lack hardware details and statistical significance testing
- 6-month timeline shows in limited scope: only decoder-only models tested

*Questions:*
- How does compression affect model calibration and uncertainty estimates?
- What happens with instruction-tuned or RLHF models?

**Recommendation**: Weak accept. Useful empirical study but needs stronger positioning relative to parameter-efficient fine-tuning literature.

---

**Reviewer #3 (Critical) - Score: 5/10 (Borderline)**

*Strengths:*
- Addresses important problem for LLM deployment
- Reproducibility checklist complete; appreciate the detailed hyperparameter tables

*Weaknesses:*
- **Major**: Evaluation limited to perplexity and standard NLP benchmarks. No evaluation on generation quality, factuality, or safety—critical for LLMs
- Compression-decompression workflow unclear: is this for storage or inference? Latency analysis insufficient
- Related work misses recent pruning methods (SparseGPT, Wanda) and distillation approaches
- Formatting issues: Figure 2 caption incomplete, Table 4 overflows margin

*Missing experiments:*
- Long-context performance (compression may disproportionately hurt this)
- Few-shot in-context learning ability
- Cross-lingual evaluation

**Recommendation**: Borderline. Needs substantial revision to address evaluation gaps and clarify use case.

**Meta-Reviewer Summary:**

The paper presents a competent empirical study of adaptive low-rank compression for LLMs with practical benefits. However, reviewers consistently note limited scope (likely due to the 6-month timeline), missing baselines from the rapidly evolving compression literature, and insufficient evaluation of LLM-specific capabilities beyond perplexity. 

**Decision**: Weak accept with revisions, or resubmit to a workshop for community feedback before targeting a top-tier venue. Authors should:
1. Add comparisons with SparseGPT, GPTQ, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
2. Evaluate generation quality, factuality, and in-context learning
3. Provide clearer use-case analysis (storage vs. inference optimization)
4. Strengthen theoretical or empirical novelty claims

## Recommendations for Your 6-Month Project

Given the timeline:

1. **Target TMLR or a workshop first** to get feedback, then revise for NeurIPS/ICML
2. **Focus scope carefully**: Deep evaluation on 2-3 models rather than shallow coverage of many
3. **Anticipate ethics requirements early**: Document compute costs, energy usage, and potential dual-use concerns
4. **Prepare reproducibility artifacts**: Code, configs, and compressed checkpoints significantly improve acceptance odds
5. **Budget time for formatting**: Allow 1-2 weeks for LaTeX compliance, ethics statements, and checklist completion
