Below is a concise, venue-aligned checklist of ethics/compliance sections your language-model-for-law paper should satisfy, plus where to find the official checklists and artifact expectations. I separate (A) cross-venue “must-have” sections that are consistently expected, (B) venue-specific requirements/notes, and (C) artifact and documentation practices that conferences increasingly expect or formally badge.

A) Cross‑venue sections to include in the paper and supplemental materials
- Ethics/Responsible use statement
  - Potential harms and dual use in legal contexts (e.g., generating unauthorized legal advice, unfair treatment, jurisdictional sensitivities), mitigations, red‑teaming, deployment constraints. This is evaluated in NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML ethics review and ACL/AAAI ethical policies [1][3][6][9][10].
- Human subjects, sensitive data, privacy, and compliance
  - IRB/ethics approval (if applicable), informed consent, handling of PII, minors, sealed/court records, licensing and terms of service, data minimization and anonymization; compliance with applicable law (e.g., GDPR/CCPA when relevant) [1][3][6][9][10].
- Dataset documentation (Datasheet) and data provenance
  - Sources; collection/labeling; licenses; known biases; safety filters; access conditions; legal restrictions on redistribution (e.g., court data) [13]. Link the datasheet.
- Model documentation (Model Card)
  - Intended use, out‑of‑scope uses (e.g., not a substitute for counsel), evaluation slices (jurisdiction, case type), failure modes, safety mitigations [12]. Link the model card.
- Limitations section (mandatory at ACL; strongly expected elsewhere)
  - Known limitations, failure cases, external validity, and legal-domain caveats such as jurisdictional coverage and unauthorized practice of law considerations [8].
- Reproducibility checklist (at submission)
  - Datasets, licenses, preprocessing; models; training details (hyperparameters, seeds, compute); evaluation protocols; variance and statistical reporting; ablations [2][7][10].
- Code/data/artifacts release
  - Public repo and tag; environment and dependencies; container or exact environment spec; instructions and scripts to reproduce tables/figures; data access path or request process if restricted [5][11].
- Compute and environmental impact (if available)
  - Hardware, training time, FLOPs/energy estimate and carbon metrics where feasible [7].
- Conflicts of interest and funding disclosures
  - Sponsors, in‑kind compute or data support, affiliations, and any constraints on publication or release [3][6][9][10].

B) Venue‑specific requirements and where to find them
- NeurIPS
  - Ethics review: authors must flag ethical issues; papers may be reviewed by ethics reviewers [1]. 
  - Reproducibility/Paper checklist: NeurIPS checklist covers datasets, models, code, results, and broader impact/ethics cues [2].
  - Author FAQ clarifies code/data expectations and ethics review routing [3].
- ICML
  - Publication ethics and paper guidelines: emphasize ethical compliance, COI disclosures, and reproducibility at submission; code/data strongly encouraged [4][6].
- ICLR
  - Author Guide and ethics process: ethics issues can trigger specialized review; authors must disclose sensitive aspects and approvals when relevant [9]. See discussion of ethics cases for exemplars of what triggers review [11].
- ACL (ACL/EMNLP/EACL/ARR)
  - Ethical policies and publication ethics: Limitations section is mandatory in ACL papers; ethics review can be triggered via flagging; privacy/IRB compliance expected when applicable [8][9].
- AAAI
  - Reproducibility checklist required; policies page covers ethical responsibilities, originality, and disclosure expectations (including conflicts and funding) [10][11].

C) Artifact adherence, documentation, and badging
- ACM Artifact Review and Badging (if submitting to ACM‑affiliated venues or seeking badges)
  - Prepare for “Artifacts Available,” “Artifacts Evaluated – Functional/Reusable,” and “Results Reproduced/Replicated” criteria: archival hosting, installability, documentation, and reproducibility of key results [5].
- Community documentation standards you should attach even if not strictly required
  - Model Cards for Model Reporting (attach to repo or supplemental) [12].
  - Datasheets for Datasets (attach to data or paper appendix) [13].
- Practical packaging to pass artifact review
  - Versioned code with environment spec (Docker/Conda), seed control, scripts to reproduce each table/figure, checksums for datasets/models, license files, and an explicit “artifact README” mapping each paper claim to a reproduction script [5][7][11].

A concise compliance template you can reuse
- Ethics/Responsible use: scope, potential harms/misuse in legal contexts, mitigations, deployment restrictions, and red‑teaming summary.
- Human subjects and privacy: IRB/ethics determination, consent, PII handling, licenses/ToS, data governance, jurisdictional constraints.
- Dataset documentation: datasheet link; provenance; licenses; biases; access conditions.
- Model documentation: model card link; intended/out‑of‑scope uses; known failure modes; evaluation slices relevant to law.
- Limitations: performance caveats, external validity, jurisdictional limits, and non‑advice disclaimer.
- Reproducibility details: training/eval details, seeds, compute, metrics, uncertainty, ablations; reproducibility checklist filled.
- Artifacts: code/data/models release plan, environment, and instructions; badge targets (if relevant).
- Disclosures: funding, COI, in‑kind support; compute credits; data access arrangements.

Notes specific to legal‑domain LMs
- Be explicit that the system does not provide legal advice and should not be used as a substitute for licensed counsel (good practice within Ethics/Responsible use and Limitations).
- Document jurisdictional scope and evaluation slices (e.g., US federal vs. state, EU member states), and known gaps that could lead to harmful or discriminatory outcomes in legal processes (Ethics/Model card).
- If training on court filings or scraped legal databases, disclose licenses/ToS, privacy handling for sensitive parties, and any redactions or denoising applied (Human subjects/data documentation). These items are commonly scrutinized during ethics review across venues [1][8][9][10].

If you tell me your target venue and whether you will release code/data/models, I can tailor this into a one-page compliance appendix and fill the specific submission checklist language.
