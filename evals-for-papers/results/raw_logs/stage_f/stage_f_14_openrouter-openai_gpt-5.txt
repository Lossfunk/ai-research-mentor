Below is a concise, reviewer-oriented risk map and a concrete mitigation checklist you can run before finalizing your climate-research AI paper and artifacts.

Major reviewer-facing risks (and what they look for)
- Data leakage and non-stationarity
  - Temporal leakage (using future information during training/normalization), spatial leakage (tile overlap), target leakage via engineered features not available at inference.
  - Ignoring distribution shift (e.g., regime changes, ENSO/volcanic years, climate change trend).
- Weak or unfair baselines
  - No comparisons to climatology, persistence, simple statistical baselines, or established physics-based methods; hyperparameter tuning not symmetric across methods.
- Incomplete provenance and licensing
  - Missing dataset DOIs/versions (e.g., CMIP6 variant_id, ERA5 release date), unclear preprocessing/regridding, redistribution of restricted data instead of fetch scripts.
- Evaluation gaps and misleading metrics
  - Only reporting RMSE/MAE; no bias, correlation, or skill scores; no stratification by region/season/extremes; no uncertainty or calibration; cherry-picked case studies or inconsistent color scales/units.
- Physical inconsistency
  - Predictions violate known constraints (e.g., negative precipitation, mass/energy imbalances) without checks or discussion.
- Reproducibility deficits
  - No runnable code/configs, missing seeds and environment pins, nondeterministic pipelines, unclear splits, opaque feature engineering.
- Overclaiming impact or scope
  - Operational/policy claims without caveats; limited geography/time presented as general; causal language without identification strategy.
- Robustness and OOD performance
  - No tests across regimes (e.g., ENSO phases), sensor outages, or scenario shifts (historical → future SSPs); sensitivity to hyperparameters not explored.
- Compute/energy transparency
  - No report of compute budget, energy/carbon footprint, or cost; reviewers in climate may expect sustainability transparency.
- Ethical/data-governance issues
  - Lack of data-use compliance (e.g., redistribution of licensed satellite data), missing IRB/data-ethics note if human/indigenous data are involved; absent COI/funding disclosures.

Mitigation checklist for the final submission package
- Data provenance and handling
  - Provide a dataset ledger: name, DOI/URL, version/date, license/terms, spatial/temporal coverage, variables/units.
  - Include reproducible fetch/preprocess scripts; do not mirror restricted datasets.
  - Document QC: quality flags, gap-filling, outlier handling, regridding/resampling (method, target grid, CRS), and alignment across sources.
  - Prevent leakage: compute normalization on training data only; enforce non-overlapping spatial tiles; describe temporal train/val/test boundaries.
- Splits and experimental design
  - Use leakage-resistant splits (temporal holdout; spatial block CV; region and year holdouts). Publish seeds and split indices.
  - Justify scenario/OOD tests (e.g., 2000–2014 train, 2015–2019 val, 2020–2023 test; separate ENSO+ vs ENSO− subsets).
- Baselines and comparators
  - Include climatology and persistence; simple statistical (linear reg., random forest) and a reference physics-based or established ML baseline.
  - Tune all methods fairly with the same protocol and report compute budgets per method.
- Metrics and reporting
  - Core: RMSE/MAE, bias, correlation; skill scores where applicable (e.g., NSE); extreme-aware metrics (quantile loss, hit/false-alarm for thresholds).
  - Calibration: prediction intervals, coverage, ECE/Brier where relevant.
  - Disaggregate: per-region, per-season, per-regime; report uncertainty (95% CIs via block bootstrap for spatiotemporal dependence).
  - Visuals: consistent units, axes, and perceptually uniform color maps; identical scales across models; include uncertainty shading.
- Physical consistency checks
  - Enforce or post-check constraints (non-negativity, conservation); report violation rates and any corrective post-processing.
- Robustness and sensitivity
  - OOD tests: regime years (ENSO/volcanic), sensor dropouts, future scenarios if relevant.
  - Ablations: architecture choices, features, resolution; sensitivity to hyperparameters and random seeds.
- Reproducibility artifacts
  - Public repo with: code, configs, exact splits, environment.yml/requirements.txt, Dockerfile; deterministic flags; one-command scripts for ≥2 headline results.
  - Logs with commit hash, hardware, software versions; expected-vs-obtained table with CIs.
  - Model/data cards summarizing scope, limitations, licenses, and known failure modes.
- Licensing and compliance
  - LICENSE for code (MIT/Apache-2.0); model license (Apache/OpenRAIL if usage restrictions needed).
  - Do not redistribute proprietary datasets; include original licenses and usage terms; document any DUAs.
  - Acknowledge third-party assets (NOTICE, third_party_licenses.txt).
- Compute and sustainability
  - Report training/inference compute (GPU-hours), energy/carbon estimates (tool, region/intensity assumptions), and cost where possible; note efficiency measures (mixed precision, early stopping).
- Ethics, transparency, and disclosures
  - Ethics/impact section: intended use, prohibited use, risks of misuse, and societal limitations.
  - Limitations section: scope (geos, times, variables), non-stationarity risks, generalization caveats.
  - Funding and COI disclosures; data-governance notes (and IRB if any human/indigenous data were used).
- Submission hygiene
  - Double-blind compliance (if applicable): scrub affiliations from artifacts, remove metadata, anonymize links.
  - Link checker: verify all URLs/DOIs; ensure artifact sizes/formats meet venue limits.

Final pre-submission “green light” actions
- Run end-to-end reproduction on a clean machine; confirm metrics within stated CIs.
- Regenerate all plots/tables from scripts; lock seeds and record versions.
- Re-read claims against results; demote any claim not supported across regions/seasons.
- Perform a physical-consistency and leakage audit; attach a short QA report to the supplement.
- Have a domain expert sanity-check units, scales, and physical plausibility.

If you share your target venue and datasets (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6, Sentinel), I can tailor the licensing/provenance notes and metric set to that community’s norms and the venue’s reproducibility checklist.
