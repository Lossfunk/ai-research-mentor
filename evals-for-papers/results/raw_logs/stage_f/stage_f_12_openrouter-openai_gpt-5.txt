Below are copy-ready artifact release notes and rebuttal-style reviewer response bullets tailored for an interpretable medical imaging paper. They emphasize anonymization and patient-data compliance and include specific, citable standards and policies.

Artifact release notes (v1.0, interpretable medical imaging)
- Overview
  - This release contains code, trained models, evaluation scripts, and de-identified example data sufficient to reproduce the main figures/tables. No protected health information (PHI) or identifiable images are included.

- What’s included
  - Code: Training/inference, attribution/interpretability methods, evaluation harness, and unit tests.
  - Models: Checkpoints for baseline and interpretable variants; SHA256 checksums; load/forward tests.
  - Data assets: Synthetic examples and fully de-identified samples for demonstrating pipelines; dataset fetch scripts and a ledger (source, version, license).
  - Docs: README, model card(s), dataset card(s), ethics/compliance statement, and expected-vs-obtained metrics with seeds.

- Patient data privacy and de-identification
  - HIPAA Safe Harbor/Expert Determination: We removed direct identifiers and quasi-identifiers per 45 CFR 164.514, including names, all elements of dates (except year) related to an individual, and device/serial numbers; geographic info smaller than a state is removed or generalized [1][2].
  - DICOM de-identification: We apply the DICOM PS3.15 Annex E Basic Application Confidentiality Profile with options appropriate to our data (Clean Pixel Data, Clean Descriptors, Clean Graphics/Annotations, Retain Longitudinal with Modified Dates), remove private tags, and remap UIDs; date shifting preserves intervals while eliminating absolute dates [3].
  - Burned-in annotations: We detect and remove burned-in PHI via OCR screening and the DICOM Clean Pixel Data option; overlays with text are cleared [3][5].
  - GDPR note (if applicable): Publicly released samples are anonymized such that data subjects are not identifiable; if any dataset remains only pseudonymized (e.g., coded but re-linkable), it is treated as personal data and is not publicly released; access requires a data use agreement (DUA) and appropriate lawful basis [4].

- Ethics/IRB/compliance
  - Institutional review: The study underwent IRB/ethics review (details provided in the paper/camera-ready). For public artifacts, only fully de-identified data are released. Consent was obtained or a waiver/exemption was granted as applicable.
  - Reporting: We report aggregate results only; small-cell counts are suppressed to reduce re-identification risk.

- Data sharing policy
  - Public: Code, models, synthetic data, and fully de-identified examples.
  - Controlled: Any real-world de-identified datasets are available only via DUA and approved request; we provide contact, application template, and review criteria (research purpose, privacy safeguards).
  - We do not redistribute third-party data; scripts fetch from original sources under their licenses.

- Security and governance
  - Storage: Public data audited for PHI; repository and releases scanned for secrets before publication.
  - Vulnerability disclosure: SECURITY.md lists a private contact and 90-day disclosure policy.

- Licensing
  - Code: Apache-2.0 (or MIT).
  - Models: Apache-2.0 (or a suitable responsible-use license).
  - Data: CC BY 4.0 for synthetic/derived examples; third-party datasets retain original licenses and are not mirrored.

- Reproducibility
  - Environments: environment.yml, requirements.txt, Dockerfile; deterministic flags and seeds documented.
  - One-command runs: scripts to reproduce two core results (with logs and confidence intervals).
  - Provenance: Each run logs commit hash, hardware, and software versions.

- Known limitations
  - Residual re-identification risk can never be reduced to zero; release is restricted accordingly [4].
  - De-identification may remove clinically relevant annotations; we document any fields removed.

- How to cite and contact
  - Provide BibTeX for the paper and software. Include contact email for data access and compliance queries.

Reviewer response bullet points (for rebuttal/ethics and artifacts)
- De-identification standard and coverage
  - We implemented HIPAA Safe Harbor/Expert Determination de-identification, removing identifiers specified in 45 CFR 164.514 (names, all elements of dates except year, device/serial numbers, and sub-state location info) [1][2].
  - DICOM-level compliance uses PS3.15 Annex E Basic Profile with Clean Pixel Data/Descriptors/Graphics and date-shifted longitudinal retention; UIDs are remapped and private tags removed (no site/manufacturer serials or institution names retained) [3].
  - Burned-in PHI was screened (OCR) and removed; overlays/graphics cleared per DICOM confidentiality options [3][5].

- GDPR and data release scope (if EU data involved)
  - Only data anonymized to the point that data subjects are not identifiable are public; any merely pseudonymized data remain regulated personal data and are distributed only under DUA with safeguards [4].

- Patient consent/IRB
  - Ethics review completed; consent obtained or waiver/exemption documented per protocol. Public artifacts contain only de-identified data; no raw identifiers or linkage keys are retained.

- Anonymization for review
  - All submission materials (PDF, videos, images, metadata) were scrubbed of institutional identifiers; DICOM headers and file metadata were cleaned; any media with potential identifiers were excluded or masked. Links are anonymized during review.

- Data availability and why some data are restricted
  - We provide: de-identification pipeline, header cleaning rules, annotation redaction scripts, and synthetic examples; full real datasets require a DUA because de-identification cannot guarantee zero re-identification risk, consistent with GDPR’s stance on anonymization vs pseudonymization [4].

- Model and interpretability artifacts
  - Released: training/evaluation code, checkpoints, attribution maps generation, faithfulness and localization evaluation scripts, and unit tests. Model cards document clinical scope, limitations, and appropriate use.

- Provenance and reproducibility
  - Dataset ledger (source, version, license) and exact preprocessing steps (including tag lists and date-shift policy) are documented; seeds, hyperparameters, and environment specs are provided to reproduce all headline metrics.

- Risk mitigation in reporting
  - Only aggregate statistics are reported; small-cell suppression applied; we verified that interpretability visualizations do not include PHI (e.g., no burned-in text, no unblurred facial features in photographs). Pixel-level overlays were generated from de-identified inputs.

- Validation that de-identification “took”
  - Random audits of released samples confirm removal of identifiers; DICOM conformance checks passed; we include a script for users to verify absence of known PHI tags and overlays [3][5].

- Why our approach aligns with community best practices
  - The de-identification pipeline aligns with HIPAA de-identification guidance and DICOM confidentiality profiles; removal of burned-in annotations and private tags is consistent with ACR/AAPM/SIIM recommendations for ML workflows [1][3][5].

If helpful, we can add: a tag whitelist/blacklist appendix, a de-id QA report template, and a standard DUA form to the supplement.
