I'll create a comprehensive submission checklist for your paper on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) transfer. However, I don't have access to your actual paper document. I'll provide a **general checklist tailored to MIL transfer research**, but please upload your paper so I can give you **specific, actionable feedback** on what's actually missing.

### **⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT**

#### **HIGH RISK (Must Fix Before Submission)**

1. **Dataset License Violations**
   - **Risk**: Using datasets with incompatible licenses (e.g., non-commercial data in commercial research)
   - **Check**: Verify each dataset's license allows your use case
   - **Fix**: Replace datasets or add explicit license compliance statement

2. **Medical Data Without Ethics Statement**
   - **Risk**: Using pathology/radiology data without IRB/ethics mention
   - **Check**: If using Camelyon, TCGA, TIGER, etc., confirm public dataset exemption
   - **Fix**: Add: "All datasets are publicly available and exempt from IRB review per institutional policy"

3. **Missing Compute Disclosure**
   - **Risk**: Reviewers flag lack of reproducibility information
   - **Check**: Hardware, time, and hyperparameters documented
   - **Fix**: Add "Computational Resources" subsection in experiments

4. **Incomplete Baselines**
   - **Risk**: Reviewers reject for insufficient comparison
   - **Check**: Compare against non-transfer MIL and standard transfer learning
   - **Fix**: Add at least 3 baseline conditions

#### **MEDIUM RISK (Strengthen Before Submission)**

5. **Weak Limitations Section**
   - **Risk**: Appears overconfident; reviewers penalize
   - **Check**: Honest discussion of when transfer fails
   - **Fix**: Add dedicated "Limitations" section (0.5 pages)

6. **Missing Statistical Significance**
   - **Risk**: Claims not substantiated
   - **Check**: Error bars, p-values, or confidence intervals on all main results
   - **Fix**: Run experiments 3-5 times with different seeds; report mean ± std

7. **Unclear Transfer Protocol**
   - **Risk**: Reproducibility concerns
   - **Check**: Exact fine-tuning procedure, learning rates, frozen layers specified
   - **Fix**: Add algorithmic box or detailed protocol description

8. **No Negative Results**
   - **Risk**: Appears cherry-picked
   - **Check**: Show at least one source-target pair where transfer doesn't help
   - **Fix**: Add "Failure Analysis" subsection

#### **LOW RISK (Nice to Have)**

9. **Carbon Footprint Not Reported**
   - **Risk**: Minor reviewer comment
   - **Fix**: Use [ML CO2 Impact Calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact/) and add 1 sentence

10. **Code Not Available During Review**
    - **Risk**: Some reviewers prefer anonymous code
    - **Fix**: Create anonymous GitHub repo (if venue allows)

### **🔧 SPECIFIC FIXES & MISSING ITEMS**

#### **Likely Missing (Based on Typical MIL Transfer Papers)**

1. **Dataset Documentation Table**
   ```
   Add a table like:
   
   | Dataset | Domain | # Bags | # Instances/Bag | License | Source |
   |---------|--------|--------|-----------------|---------|--------|
   | MNIST-Bags | Synthetic | 1000 | 10-50 | MIT | [Citation] |
   | Camelyon16 | Histopathology | 400 | 1000-10000 | CC0 | [Citation] |
   ```

2. **Transfer Protocol Algorithm**
   ```
   Add pseudocode:
   
   Algorithm 1: MIL Transfer Learning
   Input: Source MIL model M_s, target dataset D_t
   1. Initialize M_t with M_s weights
   2. Freeze instance encoder (optional)
   3. Fine-tune on D_t for N epochs
   4. Evaluate on held-out test set
   Output: Transferred model M_t
   ```

3. **Computational Resources Statement**
   ```
   Add to experiments section:
   
   "All experiments were conducted on 4× NVIDIA V100 GPUs (32GB). 
   Each transfer experiment required approximately 2 hours of training 
   (8 GPU-hours total). Total computational budget: ~500 GPU-hours. 
   Estimated carbon footprint: 12 kg CO₂eq (US grid average)."
   ```

4. **Limitations Section**
   ```
   Add before conclusion:
   
   "Limitations: (1) Our study focuses on vision-based MIL; transfer 
   in text or graph MIL remains unexplored. (2) We evaluate on 
   datasets with similar bag sizes; extreme size mismatches may 
   degrade transfer. (3) Computational constraints limited us to 
   [X] source-target pairs; broader coverage needed."
   ```

5. **Ethics/Broader Impact Statement**
   ```
   Add (required for most venues):
   
   "Broader Impact: This work investigates fundamental transfer 
   learning properties of MIL models. Positive impacts include 
   reduced data requirements for medical diagnosis tasks. Potential 
   negative impacts include over-reliance on transferred models 
   without domain-specific validation, which could lead to 
   misdiagnosis if deployed clinically without proper oversight."
   ```

6. **Data Availability Statement**
   ```
   Add after conclusion or in appendix:
   
   "Data Availability: All datasets used are publicly available. 
   MNIST-Bags: [URL]. Camelyon16: [URL]. TIGER: [URL]. Processed 
   data splits will be released with code upon acceptance."
   ```

7. **Code Availability Statement**
   ```
   Add:
   
   "Code Availability: Code for all experiments will be released 
   under MIT license at [anonymous GitHub during review / 
   github.com/yourlab/mil-transfer upon acceptance]."
   ```
