## 📋 ETHICS & COMPLIANCE GUIDE: Language Models for Law

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Legal AI Has Heightened Scrutiny

Language models for legal applications face **exceptional compliance requirements** due to:
- **High-stakes decisions**: Legal advice affects rights, liberty, property
- **Bias amplification**: Historical legal data contains systemic biases
- **Professional responsibility**: Unauthorized practice of law concerns
- **Data sensitivity**: Legal documents may contain privileged information
- **Accountability**: Who is liable for model errors?
- **Access to justice**: Equity and fairness implications

2. Geographic bias:
   - 45% of cases from California, New York (10% of US population)
   - Rural areas underrepresented
   
3. Temporal bias:
   - Older cases (pre-2000) have different legal standards
   - Recent cases may not reflect current law
   
4. Domain bias:
   - Criminal law overrepresented (60% of dataset)
   - Civil rights, immigration underrepresented (<5%)

We evaluate model performance across demographic groups (Table 4) 
and find disparate impact (Section 5.4)."

Safeguards:
- Adversarial training
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and monitoring"
```

**Q5.2: Does your paper involve potential risks related to fairness or bias?**
- [ ] Yes → Must analyze and mitigate
- [ ] No

**For legal AI (ALWAYS YES):**
```
Example answer:
"Yes. Section 5.4 analyzes fairness:

Bias analysis:
- We evaluate model performance across race, gender, income
- Find disparate impact: 8% lower accuracy for Black defendants
- Find gender bias: Model more likely to recommend harsher sentences 
  for women in certain crime categories

Mitigation:
- Reweighting training data to balance demographics
- Adversarial debiasing (remove demographic signal from embeddings)
- Post-processing calibration to equalize error rates

Limitations:
- Cannot fully eliminate bias (inherent in training data)

### B. Broader Impacts Statement (Required Section in Paper)

**Location**: Unnumbered section before references (or after conclusion)

**Length**: 0.5-1 page

**Template for Legal AI:**

```latex
\section*{Broader Impacts}

\subsection*{Positive Impacts}

\textbf{Access to Justice:} Our model has the potential to increase 
access to legal information for underserved populations. By reducing 
the cost of legal research and document analysis, we may help 
low-income individuals who cannot afford attorneys. This aligns with 
the American Bar Association's goal of closing the justice gap 
\citep{aba2020access}.

\textbf{Efficiency for Legal Professionals:} Lawyers spend significant 
time on routine tasks like document review and legal research. Our 
model can automate these tasks, allowing lawyers to focus on higher-value 
work such as client counseling and strategy. This may reduce legal costs 
for clients.

\textbf{Consistency and Transparency:} Unlike human decision-makers, 
our model applies consistent reasoning across cases. This transparency 
may help identify and reduce arbitrary decision-making in the legal system.

\subsection*{Negative Impacts}

\textbf{Bias Amplification:} Our model is trained on historical legal 
data that reflects systemic biases in the legal system. We find evidence 
of racial and gender bias in model outputs (Section 5.4). If deployed 
without careful oversight, our model could perpetuate or amplify these 
biases, leading to unfair outcomes for marginalized groups.

\textbf{Unauthorized Practice of Law:} Non-lawyers may misuse our model 
to provide legal advice, which constitutes unauthorized practice of law 
in most jurisdictions. This could harm individuals who receive incorrect 
legal guidance and face adverse legal consequences.

\textbf{Job Displacement:} Automation of legal tasks may displace 
paralegals, legal assistants, and junior lawyers. While this may reduce 
costs, it also has economic consequences for legal workers.

\textbf{Reduced Human Oversight:} Over-reliance on AI may lead to 
reduced human oversight in legal decision-making. Lawyers may defer to 
model outputs without critical evaluation, leading to errors.

\textbf{Privacy Risks:} Our model is trained on legal documents that 
contain sensitive personal information. Despite our efforts to redact 
PII, there is a risk that the model may memorize and leak private 
information.

\subsection*{Mitigation Strategies}

We recommend the following safeguards for responsible deployment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Human-in-the-loop:} Model outputs should always be reviewed 
by licensed attorneys before being used in legal decisions.

\item \textbf{Bias auditing:} Regular evaluation of model fairness across 
demographic groups, with corrective action if disparate impact is detected.

\item \textbf{Access controls:} Limit model access to verified legal 
professionals to prevent unauthorized practice of law.

\item \textbf{Transparency:} Provide clear disclaimers about model 
limitations and disclose training data sources.

\item \textbf{Privacy protections:} Use differential privacy, PII redaction, 
and output filtering to protect sensitive information.

\item \textbf{Ongoing monitoring:} Track model performance in deployment 
and update as laws change.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Stakeholder Engagement}

We engaged with legal professionals, civil rights organizations, and 
legal aid societies during model development. Their feedback informed 
our bias mitigation strategies and deployment recommendations. We commit 
to ongoing dialogue with stakeholders as this technology evolves.

\subsection*{Regulatory Considerations}

Legal AI is subject to professional responsibility rules, including 
attorney-client privilege, confidentiality, and competence requirements. 
We recommend that jurisdictions develop clear guidelines for AI use in 
legal practice, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Standards for attorney supervision of AI tools
\item Requirements for bias testing and transparency
\item Liability frameworks for AI errors
\item Protections for attorney-client privilege when using AI
\end{itemize}

We hope our work contributes to informed policy discussions about AI 
in the legal system.
```

### C. Limitations Section (Required)

**Location**: Unnumbered section before references (or after conclusion)

**Length**: 0.3-0.5 page

**Template for Legal AI:**

```latex
\section*{Limitations}

\subsection*{Data Limitations}

\textbf{Geographic and temporal scope:} Our model is trained primarily 
on US federal court opinions from 2000-2023. It may not generalize to:
\begin{itemize}
\item State law (which varies significantly across jurisdictions)
\item International law or non-US legal systems
\item Historical cases (pre-2000) with different legal standards
\item Future cases (laws change over time)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Domain coverage:} Our training data overrepresents criminal law 
(60\% of cases) and underrepresents civil rights, immigration, and tax 
law (<5\% each). Model performance is significantly lower on 
underrepresented domains (Table 5).

\textbf{Data quality:} Court opinions are written for human readers, 
not ML training. They may contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implicit reasoning not stated in the opinion
\item References to oral arguments or evidence not in the record
\item Errors or typos in the original documents
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Model Limitations}

\textbf{Hallucination:} Like other large language models, our model 
sometimes generates plausible-sounding but incorrect legal citations 
or reasoning. We measure a 12\% hallucination rate on legal citations 
(Section 4.3). This is unacceptable for legal practice without human 
verification.

\textbf{Lack of common sense:} Our model lacks real-world knowledge 
and common sense reasoning that human lawyers possess. It may miss 
obvious practical considerations or misinterpret factual scenarios.

\textbf{Inability to handle novel situations:} Our model is trained on 
historical cases and may struggle with novel legal questions or rapidly 
evolving areas of law (e.g., cryptocurrency, AI regulation).

\textbf{No understanding of legal ethics:} Our model does not understand 
professional responsibility rules, attorney-client privilege, or conflicts 
of interest. It cannot replace human judgment on ethical questions.

\subsection*{Evaluation Limitations}

\textbf{Metrics:} We evaluate using accuracy and F1 score, which may 
not capture all aspects of legal reasoning quality. Human lawyers may 
disagree on the "correct" answer to legal questions.

\textbf{Test set:} Our test set is drawn from the same distribution as 
training data (US federal courts, 2022-2023). Performance may be lower 
on out-of-distribution cases.

\textbf{Human evaluation:} Our human evaluation involved 50 lawyers, 
which may not be representative of all legal professionals. Evaluators 
had limited time (30 min per case) and may have missed subtle errors.

\subsection*{Deployment Limitations}

\textbf{Not legal advice:} Our model is a research prototype and should 
not be used to provide legal advice. It has not been validated for 
real-world legal practice.

\textbf{Requires legal expertise:} Interpreting and validating model 
outputs requires legal training. Non-lawyers should not use this model 
for legal decision-making.

\textbf{Computational cost:} Our model requires significant computational 
resources (8× A100 GPUs for training, 1× A100 for inference). This may 
limit accessibility for smaller organizations.

\subsection*{Bias and Fairness Limitations}

Despite our bias mitigation efforts, we cannot fully eliminate bias 
from our model. Historical legal data reflects systemic inequities, 
and our model may perpetuate these biases. We find evidence of disparate 
impact across race and gender (Section 5.4). Users should carefully 
evaluate fairness for their specific use case.
```

### D. Data Statement (Required for NLP Venues)

**For ACL/EMNLP, this is a separate required section**

**Template:**

```latex
\section*{Data Statement}

Following \citet{bender2018data}, we provide a data statement for our 
training corpus.

\subsection*{Curation Rationale}

We curated a dataset of US federal court opinions to train a language 
model for legal reasoning. We chose federal courts because:
\begin{itemize}
\item Opinions are publicly available and well-structured
\item Federal law is more uniform than state law
\item Federal courts handle significant constitutional and statutory issues
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Language Variety}

\textbf{BCP-47 identifier:} en-US

\textbf{Language variety:} American English, legal register. Court 
opinions use formal, technical language with specialized legal terminology. 
This differs significantly from general English corpora.

\textbf{Speaker demographics:} Court opinions are written by federal 
judges, who are predominantly white (73\%), male (67\%), and over age 
50 (median age 62) \citep{uscourts2023demographics}. This demographic 
skew may influence language use and reasoning patterns.

\subsection*{Annotator Demographics}

We hired 10 law students to annotate a subset of cases for evaluation. 
Annotators were:
\begin{itemize}
\item 6 female, 4 male
\item Ages 24-28 (median 25)
\item 7 white, 2 Asian, 1 Hispanic
\item All from US law schools (5 from top-14 schools, 5 from regional schools)
\item Compensated \$25/hour (above minimum wage)
\end{itemize}

Annotators received 4 hours of training on annotation guidelines and 
completed a qualification task before annotating production data.

\subsection*{Speech Situation}

Court opinions are written for multiple audiences:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parties to the case (lawyers and litigants)
\item Appellate courts (if the case is appealed)
\item Future courts (as precedent)
\item Legal scholars and the public
\end{itemize}

Opinions are formal, authoritative, and intended to persuade. They 
follow strict conventions (e.g., citation format, structure).

\subsection*{Text Characteristics}

\textbf{Genre:} Legal opinions (judicial decisions)

\textbf{Topic:} Wide range of legal issues (criminal, civil, constitutional, 
administrative, etc.)

\textbf{Structure:} Opinions typically include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Procedural history
\item Statement of facts
\item Legal issues presented
\item Analysis and reasoning
\item Holding (decision)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Length:} Median 15 pages (range: 1-200 pages)

\textbf{Publication date:} 2000-2023

\subsection*{Provenance and Collection}

\textbf{Source:} CourtListener API (https://www.courtlistener.com/)

\textbf{Collection method:} Automated scraping of publicly available 
court opinions

\textbf{Sampling:} All available federal court opinions (district courts, 
circuit courts, Supreme Court) from 2000-2023

\textbf{Preprocessing:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Converted PDF to text using OCR
\item Removed headers, footers, page numbers
\item Redacted party names, case numbers, SSNs using NER + regex
\item Filtered out sealed cases, juvenile records, expunged cases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Quality control:} Manual review of 1000 random samples to verify 
OCR accuracy and PII redaction

\subsection*{Ethical Considerations}

\textbf{Consent:} Court opinions are public records. Parties to cases 
did not consent to their data being used for ML training. We mitigate 
privacy concerns by redacting PII and excluding sensitive case types.

\textbf{Privacy:} Despite redaction efforts, some opinions may contain 
residual PII or sensitive information. We do not release raw data to 
minimize privacy risks.

\textbf{Bias:} Our dataset reflects biases in the legal system, including 
overrepresentation of certain demographics and underrepresentation of 
others (see Section 5.3).

\textbf{Compensation:} Court opinions are public domain (US government 
works). No compensation was provided to original authors (judges).

## 📋 SECTION 3: ACL/EMNLP SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

NLP conferences have additional requirements for language models.

### A. Responsible NLP Checklist (Mandatory)

**Submitted as separate form, similar to NeurIPS ethics checklist**

#### Additional Questions for Legal AI:

**Q: Does your model have the potential to be used in high-stakes decision-making?**
```
Answer: YES

Legal decisions affect fundamental rights (liberty, property, family). 
Our model could be used in:
- Sentencing recommendations
- Bail decisions
- Contract analysis
- Legal advice

We strongly recommend human oversight and do NOT recommend deployment 
in high-stakes settings without extensive validation.
```

**Q: Did you evaluate your model for potential biases?**
```
Answer: YES

Section 5.4 evaluates bias across:
- Race (Black, White, Hispanic, Asian)
- Gender (Male, Female)
- Income (public defender vs. private attorney)

We find statistically significant disparate impact (8% accuracy gap 
for Black defendants). We apply debiasing techniques but cannot fully 
eliminate bias.
```

**Q: Does your model work with languages other than English?**
```
Answer: NO

Our model is trained only on English (US legal English). It does not 
support other languages or legal systems. Performance on non-English 
text is undefined.
```

**Q: Did you use pre-trained models?**
```
Answer: YES

We fine-tune GPT-3.5 (175B parameters) from OpenAI. We acknowledge:
- GPT-3.5 training data is not fully disclosed
- GPT-3.5 may contain biases from web-scale training
- We cannot fully audit GPT-3.5 for legal-specific issues

We evaluate GPT-3.5 baseline performance (Table 2) and compare to 
our fine-tuned model.
```

---

### B. Computational Ethics (ACL/EMNLP)

**Q: Did you report the computational resources used?**

```latex
\subsection*{Computational Resources}

\textbf{Training:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware: 8× NVIDIA A100 (40GB) GPUs
\item Training time: 7 days (168 hours)
\item Total GPU hours: 1,344 GPU hours
\item Cloud cost: \$4,032 (AWS p4d.24xlarge at \$3/GPU-hour)
\item Energy consumption: ~2,150 kWh (estimated)
\item Carbon footprint: ~950 kg CO$_2$ (US grid average, 0.44 kg CO$_2$/kWh)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Inference:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware: 1× NVIDIA A100 (40GB) GPU
\item Latency: 2.3 seconds per query (average)
\item Throughput: ~0.4 queries/second
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Environmental impact:} We acknowledge the significant carbon 
footprint of training large language models. We used cloud providers 
with renewable energy commitments where possible. We release pre-trained 
models to reduce redundant training by other researchers.

\textbf{Compute accessibility:} The computational requirements limit 
accessibility for researchers without access to expensive GPUs. We 
provide smaller model variants (Section 4.5) that can run on consumer 
hardware.

\section*{Positionality Statement}

We acknowledge that our perspectives as researchers shape this work:

\textbf{Author backgrounds:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Author 1: Computer scientist, no formal legal training, white, male
\item Author 2: Law professor, 15 years legal practice, Asian, female
\item Author 3: PhD student, background in NLP, Hispanic, non-binary
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Institutional context:} This research was conducted at [University], 
a well-resourced institution in the United States. Our perspectives are 
shaped by the US legal system and may not generalize to other legal 
traditions.

\textbf{Stakeholder engagement:} We consulted with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Public defenders (representing low-income defendants)
\item Civil rights organizations (ACLU, NAACP Legal Defense Fund)
\item Legal aid societies
\item Private law firms
\end{itemize}

Their feedback informed our bias analysis and deployment recommendations. 
However, we acknowledge that we may have missed perspectives from other 
stakeholders (e.g., incarcerated individuals, non-English speakers).

\textbf{Limitations of our perspective:} As researchers without lived 
experience of the criminal justice system, we may not fully understand 
the harms of biased legal AI. We commit to ongoing engagement with 
affected communities.
```

### B. Algorithmic Impact Assessment (Required for FAccT)

```latex
\section*{Algorithmic Impact Assessment}

Following \citet{reisman2018algorithmic}, we provide an impact assessment:

\subsection*{1. System Description}

\textbf{Purpose:} Assist lawyers with legal research and document analysis

\textbf{Functionality:} Given a legal question or document, generate 
relevant case law, statutes, and legal reasoning

\textbf{Deployment context:} Research prototype, not deployed in production

\subsection*{2. Stakeholder Analysis}

\textbf{Direct stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lawyers (users of the system)
\item Clients (benefit from reduced legal costs)
\item Law firms (may adopt technology)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Indirect stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Parties in legal cases (affected by AI-assisted legal work)
\item Judges (may see AI-generated legal arguments)
\item Paralegals and legal assistants (may face job displacement)
\item General public (affected by access to justice implications)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vulnerable populations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Low-income individuals (may lack access to AI tools)
\item Non-English speakers (model only supports English)
\item Incarcerated individuals (limited access to technology)
\item Marginalized groups (may face biased model outputs)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Potential Harms}

\textbf{Allocative harms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Biased model outputs may lead to unfair legal outcomes
\item Disparate impact across race, gender, income (Section 5.4)
\item May advantage well-resourced parties who can afford AI tools
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Representational harms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Model may perpetuate stereotypes (e.g., associating certain 
  demographics with criminality)
\item Training data reflects historical biases in legal system
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Quality-of-service harms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower performance on underrepresented legal domains (immigration, 
  civil rights)
\item May not work well for non-standard legal questions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dignitary harms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated legal decision-making may undermine human dignity
\item Individuals may feel dehumanized by AI-driven legal processes
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Mitigation Strategies}

See Section 7.3 for detailed mitigation strategies.

\subsection*{5. Accountability Mechanisms}

\textbf{Transparency:} We release model cards, training data documentation, 
and bias evaluation results

\textbf{Redress:} We provide contact information for reporting errors 
or harms

\textbf{Oversight:} We recommend human review of all model outputs before 
use in legal decisions

\textbf{Monitoring:} We commit to ongoing evaluation if model is deployed

\subsection*{6. Governance}

\textbf{Decision-making:} Research decisions were made collaboratively 
by authors with input from legal experts and affected communities

\textbf{Conflicts of interest:} None. This research was funded by 
[public grant], not industry

\textbf{Future governance:} If deployed, we recommend establishing an 
oversight board including legal experts, ethicists, and community 
representatives
```

## 📋 SECTION 5: LEGAL AI SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE

### A. Professional Responsibility Considerations

**Required for ICAIL, JURIX, NLLP**

```latex
\section*{Professional Responsibility Considerations}

\subsection*{Unauthorized Practice of Law}

In most US jurisdictions, providing legal advice without a license 
constitutes unauthorized practice of law (UPL). Our model generates 
legal analysis that could be construed as legal advice.

\textbf{Risk:} Non-lawyers using our model to provide legal services

\textbf{Mitigation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear disclaimers that model output is not legal advice
\item Access controls limiting use to licensed attorneys
\item No public API or consumer-facing application
\item Recommendations for attorney supervision (Section 7.3)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Regulatory uncertainty:} It is unclear whether AI-generated 
legal analysis constitutes UPL. We recommend that bar associations 
provide clear guidance.

\subsection*{Attorney-Client Privilege}

Attorney-client communications are privileged and confidential. Using 
third-party AI tools may waive privilege if communications are disclosed 
to the AI provider.

\textbf{Risk:} Lawyers using our model with client data may inadvertently 
waive privilege

\textbf{Mitigation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We do not log or store user queries
\item We recommend on-premise deployment for sensitive matters
\item We provide guidance on privilege considerations (Appendix F)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Best practice:} Lawyers should obtain client consent before 
using AI tools with confidential information.

\subsection*{Competence and Diligence}

Lawyers have a duty to provide competent representation, which includes 
understanding the benefits and risks of technology (ABA Model Rule 1.1, 
Comment 8).

\textbf{Risk:} Lawyers over-relying on AI without understanding limitations

\textbf{Mitigation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comprehensive documentation of model limitations (Section 6)
\item Training materials for legal professionals (Appendix G)
\item Recommendations for validation and oversight (Section 7.3)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Best practice:} Lawyers should verify all AI-generated legal 
analysis before relying on it.

\subsection*{Conflicts of Interest}

If an AI model is trained on data from multiple clients, it may create 
conflicts of interest.

\textbf{Risk:} Model trained on law firm data may leak information 
between clients

\textbf{Mitigation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We do not train on client-specific data
\item We use only public court opinions
\item We recommend separate models for different clients if using 
  proprietary data
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Candor to the Tribunal}

Lawyers have a duty of candor to the court, including disclosing adverse 
legal authority (ABA Model Rule 3.3).

\textbf{Risk:} AI model may miss adverse authority or generate incorrect 
citations

\textbf{Mitigation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We measure citation accuracy (88\% correct, Section 4.3)
\item We recommend manual verification of all citations
\item We provide tools to detect hallucinated citations (Appendix H)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Best practice:} Lawyers should independently verify all legal 
citations before submitting to court.
```

### B. Bias and Fairness Analysis (Required)

**Detailed analysis required for legal AI**

```latex
\section*{Bias and Fairness Analysis}

\subsection*{Methodology}

We evaluate bias using:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Demographic parity:} Equal positive prediction rates across groups
\item \textbf{Equalized odds:} Equal TPR and FPR across groups
\item \textbf{Calibration:} Predicted probabilities match true outcomes across groups
\end{itemize}

We test across:
\begin{itemize}
\item Race: Black, White, Hispanic, Asian
\item Gender: Male, Female
\item Income: Public defender (proxy for low-income) vs. private attorney
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Results}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Model accuracy by demographic group}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Group} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Gap vs. White} \\
\midrule
White & 82.3\% & - \\
Black & 74.1\% & -8.2\% *** \\
Hispanic & 76.8\% & -5.5\% ** \\
Asian & 81.2\% & -1.1\% \\
\midrule
Male & 80.5\% & - \\
Female & 79.8\% & -0.7\% \\
\midrule
Private attorney & 83.1\% & - \\
Public defender & 75.4\% & -7.7\% *** \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

*** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 (two-tailed t-test)

\textbf{Finding:} Significant disparate impact across race and income. 
Model performs worse for Black defendants and those with public defenders.

\subsection*{Error Analysis}

We manually review 100 errors for each demographic group:

\textbf{Black defendants:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 45\% of errors involve misclassification of prior convictions
\item 30\% involve incorrect application of sentencing guidelines
\item 25\% involve other errors
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Model may be biased by correlation between race 
and prior convictions in training data (Black defendants more likely 
to have priors due to over-policing).

\textbf{White defendants:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Errors more evenly distributed across error types
\item No clear pattern
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Debiasing Attempts}

We apply three debiasing techniques:

\textbf{1. Reweighting:} Oversample underrepresented groups
\begin{itemize}
\item Result: Reduces accuracy gap to 5.1\% (from 8.2\%)
\item Tradeoff: Overall accuracy drops 2.3\%
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Adversarial debiasing:} Remove demographic signal from embeddings
\begin{itemize}
\item Result: Reduces accuracy gap to 6.3\%
\item Tradeoff: Overall accuracy drops 1.5\%
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Post-processing calibration:} Adjust thresholds per group
\begin{itemize}
\item Result: Achieves demographic parity
\item Tradeoff: Violates individual fairness (different thresholds for 
  different groups)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} We cannot fully eliminate bias without significant 
accuracy tradeoffs. We recommend human review for high-stakes decisions.

\subsection*{Intersectionality}

We also evaluate intersectional groups (e.g., Black women, Hispanic men):

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Model accuracy by intersectional group}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Group} & \textbf{Accuracy} \\
\midrule
White male & 82.8\% \\
White female & 81.7\% \\
Black male & 73.5\% \\
Black female & 75.2\% \\
Hispanic male & 76.3\% \\
Hispanic female & 77.5\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Finding:} Black males have lowest accuracy. Intersectional 
effects are complex and require further study.

\subsection*{Limitations of Fairness Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item We only evaluate three protected attributes (race, gender, income). 
  Other attributes (age, disability, religion) may also be relevant.
\item Our race categories are coarse (Black, White, Hispanic, Asian). 
  Finer-grained analysis may reveal additional disparities.
\item We use public defender status as proxy for income, which is imperfect.
\item Our fairness metrics may not capture all relevant notions of fairness.
\item Fairness is context-dependent; our analysis may not generalize to 
  other legal domains or jurisdictions.
\end{itemize}
```
