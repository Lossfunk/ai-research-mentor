Before I create your submission checklist, I need to collect some essential context to make this actionable:

1. **Target venue & deadline**: Which conference/journal are you targeting, and what's your submission deadline?
2. **Current completion status**: Which sections are fully drafted vs. still in progress?
3. **Co-author status**: How many co-authors, and what's their review/approval timeline?
4. **Compute/experiments**: Are all experiments complete, or do you have runs still pending?
5. **Biggest current bottleneck**: What's the single thing most likely to delay submission?

## **Intuition**
A submission checklist is only useful if it's calibrated to your actual constraints—generic lists miss the critical path items that will actually gate your deadline. Your paper appears to be a transfer learning study in MIL for pathology [file:1], so I'm inferring you likely have multi-dataset experiments [file:17], shared model weights [file:10], and potentially complex reproducibility requirements.

## **Why this is principled**
Effective pre-submission planning separates *must-have* items (those that block acceptance or violate venue rules) from *nice-to-have* polish. Research on paper rejection patterns shows that incomplete experiments, missing baselines, and unclear limitations are top reasons for desk rejection, while formatting issues rarely matter if the science is sound. Tailoring the checklist to your venue's norms and your team's bandwidth prevents last-minute scrambles.

## **Provisional Submission Checklist** (will refine once you answer above)

Based on your attached paper [file:1], here's a starter checklist:

### **Core Content (Must-Have)**
- [ ] **Abstract**: Clearly states transfer learning question, datasets, and key finding [file:1]
- [ ] **Introduction**: Motivates why MIL transfer matters, positions against SSL baselines
- [ ] **Methods**: 
  - [ ] All MIL architectures described (ABMIL, TransMIL, etc.)
  - [ ] Pretraining tasks and datasets specified [file:3]
  - [ ] Transfer protocol clearly defined [file:17]
  - [ ] Hyperparameters documented [file:16]
- [ ] **Results**: 
  - [ ] Cross-dataset transfer experiments complete [file:4, file:5]
  - [ ] Statistical significance reported (std devs present) [file:5]
  - [ ] Figures 1-2 finalized with captions
- [ ] **Discussion/Limitations**: 
  - [ ] Bias and equity considerations addressed [file:10]
  - [ ] Generalization limits acknowledged
- [ ] **Reproducibility**:
  - [ ] Model weights sharing plan confirmed [file:10]
  - [ ] Code repository prepared
  - [ ] Dataset access instructions clear

### **References & Related Work**
- [ ] All cited works in bibliography [file:11-12]
- [ ] Recent SSL/foundation model papers included (DINOv2, etc.) [file:12]
- [ ] MIL transfer learning literature covered
- [ ] Citation formatting matches venue style

### **Figures & Tables**
- [ ] Figure 2 (transfer performance) has high-res version [file:4]
- [ ] All tables have clear captions and are referenced in text [file:5, file:18]
- [ ] Supplementary figures prepared (Figures A1, A2) [file:17]

### **Formatting & Compliance**
- [ ] Page limit check (including references/appendix rules)
- [ ] Anonymization (if double-blind)
- [ ] Author contributions statement
- [ ] Acknowledgments section [file:10]
- [ ] Ethics/broader impact statement [file:10]
- [ ] Supplementary material organized

### **Pre-Submission Review**
- [ ] All co-authors have reviewed and approved
- [ ] External colleague read for clarity
- [ ] Spell-check and grammar pass
- [ ] All cross-references (figures, tables, sections) correct
- [ ] Reproducibility checklist completed (if required by venue)

## **Likely Risks** (to validate with your answers)

1. **Multi-author coordination delay**: Pathology papers often have 6+ authors [file:1]; getting sign-off can take 1-2 weeks
2. **Compute bottleneck**: If you're still running experiments across multiple GPUs [file:16], hardware failures could delay results
3. **Data sharing compliance**: You mention sharing model weights [file:10]—institutional review or licensing could slow this
4. **Reproducibility burden**: Venue may require code/data release; packaging this takes 3-5 days minimum

---

## **Next Actions** (≤48 hours)
1. **Answer the 5 intake questions above** so I can build a realistic timeline
2. **Identify your 3 highest-risk items** from the checklist (what's most likely to slip?)
3. **Draft a 1-paragraph "submission readiness" summary** for co-authors listing what's done vs. pending

Once you provide those details, I'll generate a day-by-day timeline with contingency buffers and flag any missing critical items specific to your target venue.
