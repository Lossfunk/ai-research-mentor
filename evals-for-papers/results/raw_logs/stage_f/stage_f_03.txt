Below is a concise, evidence-based submission plan you can adapt to your venue. It includes a checklist, a realistic 6–8 week timeline, risks/mitigations, missing items to resolve, and three+ concrete, falsifiable experiments.

Submission checklist (content and methodology)
- Problem framing and claims
  - Clearly define “transfer” for MIL: cross-domain (site/scanner), cross-task, and cross-bag-distribution transfers. State the exact hypotheses you test and how you quantify transfer (e.g., AUC drop, calibration shift, sample-efficiency) [P1].
  - Position vs. prior work: attention-based MIL (Ilse et al., 2018) and WSI MIL pipelines (e.g., weakly supervised pathology) should be explicitly contrasted with your transfer setting and metrics [A1], [A4].
- Datasets and splits
  - Document domains (sites/scanners/cohorts), bag/instance construction, and all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Provide deterministic train/val/test splits with seeds.
  - Include at least one explicit distribution-shift/OOD evaluation protocol; if applicable, align with Domain Generalization practice (e.g., leave-one-domain-out) inspired by DomainBed and WILDS [A3], [A2].
- Models and baselines
  - Include: attention-based MIL [A1]; a pooling baseline (max/mean); and one recent transformer-style MIL as a strong baseline if feasible; plus a non-MIL baseline where applicable to isolate the contribution of bagging.
  - Explicitly specify pretraining regimes, frozen vs. fine-tuning variants, and hyperparameter search space.
- Metrics and statistical testing
  - Report discrimination (AUC), calibration (ECE/Brier), and transfer metrics (delta vs. in-domain), with CIs via bootstrapping. Use the same metrics across domains to ensure comparability [P1].
- Reproducibility
  - Release code, scripts, config files, seeds, and environment specs; ensure deterministic training or document nondeterminism [P2].
  - Provide Model Card (model scope, intended use, limitations) and Datasheet (dataset composition, collection, licenses) [A5], [A6].
  - Consider packaging for artifact evaluation (e.g., ACM badging: Available, Functional, Reproduced) [A7].
- Ablations and analyses
  - Ablate: feature extractor (frozen vs. fine-tuned), bag size, instance sampler, regularization, augmentation, attention pooling variants, and domain-specific normalization.
  - Error analysis: characterize failure modes by domain; measure performance stratified by confounders (e.g., slide quality, stain variability).
- Ethics and compliance
  - IRB/data-use approvals (if human data), de-identification, license compliance; note potential impact and misuse risks. Include a limitations section.

Concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Cross-domain MIL transfer
- Hypothesis: Attention-based MIL trained on domain(s) S generalizes poorly to unseen domain T without adaptation; fine-tuning improves transfer but does not fully close the gap [P1].
- Design: Train on one or more source domains (e.g., sites/scanners), test on held-out domain. Compare: train-from-scratch on T vs. (i) frozen features + new MIL head, (ii) head-only fine-tuning, (iii) full fine-tuning.
- Metrics: AUC, ECE; report ΔAUC vs. in-domain; 95% CIs. Expected outcome: measurable performance drop on T; fine-tuning recovers some performance [P1].

2) Does attention-based MIL transfer better than pooling baselines?
- Hypothesis: Attention pooling (Ilse et al., 2018) transfers better than mean/max pooling because it can reweight domain-invariant instances [A1].
- Design: Same training/testing protocol as above; models: attention-MIL vs. mean- and max-pooling MIL, identical backbones and training budgets.
- Metrics: AUC/ECE on T; statistical comparison with paired bootstrap. Expected outcome: attention-MIL shows equal or better transfer than naive pooling; if not, report negative results and analyze instance-weight shifts.

3) Sample-efficiency under transfer
- Hypothesis: Pretrained MIL backbones require fewer T-domain labels to match T-from-scratch performance, showing positive transfer [P1].
- Design: Few-shot curves by labeling k% of T (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%), comparing pretrained+fine-tune vs. scratch.
- Metrics: AUC vs. label fraction; area-under-data-efficiency-curve; CIs. Expected outcome: pretrained models dominate in low-label regimes [P1].

4) Robustness to bag construction shift
- Hypothesis: Distribution shifts in bag size and instance sampling degrade transfer; attention-based MIL is less sensitive than pooling.
- Design: Vary bag size and sampler between S and T; compare ΔAUC and calibration degradation across MIL variants.
- Metrics: AUC/ECE vs. bag parameters; sensitivity analysis. Expected outcome: performance degrades with bag mismatch; magnitude differs by pooling mechanism.

Timeline to submission (6–8 weeks, adjust to venue)
- T-8 to T-7 weeks: Finalize problem scope, datasets, domains, and hypotheses; lock experimental design and seeds; create reproducible configs [P2].
- T-7 to T-5 weeks: Run core transfer experiments (Exp 1–3); monitor via tracked artifacts and versioned checkpoints; start ablations.
- T-5 to T-4 weeks: Complete ablations (bag-size, sampler, pooling variants); compute CIs and calibration metrics; begin figures/tables.
- T-4 to T-3 weeks: Draft paper (Intro/Related Work/Methods/Experiments); add negative results and error analysis; write limitations.
- T-3 to T-2 weeks: Re-run critical experiments for reproducibility; freeze main numbers; prepare Model Card, Datasheet, and ethics text [A5], [A6].
- T-2 to T-1 weeks: Internal reviews; clarity/consistency pass; finalize figures/captions; conform to venue checklist and formatting.
- T-1 to T-0 weeks: Artifact packaging (code+data links, instructions); dry-run of install/reproduce; finalize submission and supplementary; archive versioned release [P2], [A7].
- Post-submission: Prepare camera-ready to address likely reviewer asks (robustness, calibration, domain-specific analysis).

Risks and mitigations
- Domain access and IRB/data-use constraints: Ensure approvals early; if a domain is unavailable, substitute with a public proxy and clearly label as limitation.
- Compute/time overruns: Prioritize a minimal, locked experiment matrix; preemptively reduce grid sizes; adopt early stopping; cache features when possible [P2].
- Negative/ambiguous results: Pre-register hypotheses where possible; include strong baselines; report CIs and effect sizes; provide thorough error analysis to add value even when improvements are small [P2].
- Reproducibility gaps: Fix seeds, log environments, pin versions; share training scripts and configs; provide a minimal reproduction path (e.g., 1 small-run) [P2], [A7].
- Confounding shifts (label shift vs. covariate shift): Stratify evaluations, measure calibration, and include domain-metadata-controlled analyses [P1].

Missing items to resolve now
- Final list of domains/sites and exact split protocol (with seeds).
- Baseline roster and hyperparameter search space; training budgets.
- Pretraining sources and adaptation variants (frozen vs. head-only vs. full fine-tune).
- Metrics and statistical testing plan (bootstrap procedure, number of resamples).
- Model Card and Datasheet drafts [A5], [A6].
- Code release plan: repo structure, environment.yml/requirements.txt, run scripts, and a minimal reproduce script.
- Ethics/IRB approvals and dataset licenses; statement of limitations and potential misuse.

Figures/tables checklist
- Schematic of MIL transfer settings (in-domain vs. cross-domain; bag construction).
- Main table: cross-domain AUC/ECE with CIs; Δ vs. in-domain.
- Few-shot transfer curves (sample efficiency).
- Ablation tables: pooling variant, bag size, sampler.
- Calibration plots and domain-wise error analysis.

Notes on rigor
- Quantify transferability explicitly and align evaluation with domain generalization best practices (leave-one-domain-out, consistent metrics, CIs) [P1].
- Lock seeds, configs, and environments; treat reproducibility as a first-class deliverable to avoid re-run divergence near the deadline [P2].
