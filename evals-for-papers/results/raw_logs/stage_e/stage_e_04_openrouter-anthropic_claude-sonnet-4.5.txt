Based on the PeerRead paper methodology and standard practices in NLP feature engineering evaluation, I'll outline the specific ablations and error analyses reviewers will expect for the acceptance classification task.

## Critical Feature Ablations Reviewers Will Demand

### **1. Feature Category Ablations (Essential)**

The PeerRead paper likely uses multiple feature categories. Reviewers will expect systematic ablation of each:

**Expected Feature Categories:**
- **Textual features**: n-grams, embeddings, linguistic patterns
- **Structural features**: paper length, section counts, figure/table counts, equation density
- **Metadata features**: author count, institutional affiliations, citation counts
- **Readability features**: Flesch-Kincaid, sentence complexity, vocabulary diversity
- **Stylistic features**: passive voice ratio, hedge words, certainty markers

**Required Ablation Table:**

| Feature Set | Precision | Recall | F1 | Accuracy | ΔF1 from Full |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----|-----------|--------------| 
| **Full Model** | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | - |
| - Textual | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| - Structural | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| - Metadata | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| - Readability | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| - Stylistic | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| **Text Only** | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| **Non-Text Only** | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | -Y.YY |

**Interpretation to include:**
- Which feature categories contribute most to performance?
- Are non-textual features redundant with text, or complementary?
- Statistical significance testing (McNemar's test or bootstrap)

---

### **2. Individual High-Impact Feature Ablations**

Reviewers will want to see which specific features matter most.

**Analysis 2.1: Feature Importance Ranking**
```python
# For each individual feature:
- Permutation importance score
- SHAP value (mean absolute)
- Coefficient magnitude (for linear models)
- Information gain or Gini importance (for tree models)
```

**Present as:**
- **Table**: Top 20 features by importance with scores
- **Visualization**: Feature importance bar chart
- **Interpretation**: "The top 5 features account for X% of model performance"

**Analysis 2.2: Ablation of Top-K Features**
```python
# Progressive ablation
Models:
- Full model (all features)
- Remove top-1 feature
- Remove top-5 features
- Remove top-10 features
- Remove top-20 features
```

**Expected finding:** "Removing the top 5 features degrades F1 by X%, while removing features ranked 21-50 has minimal impact (ΔF1 < Y%)"

---

### **3. Textual Representation Ablations**

If using multiple text representations, reviewers expect comparison:

**Analysis 3.1: Text Encoding Comparison**

| Text Representation | F1 | Training Time | Inference Time |
|---------------------|----|--------------| ---------------|
| Bag-of-words (BoW) | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| TF-IDF | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| Word2Vec average | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| GloVe average | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| Doc2Vec | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| BERT [CLS] | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| SciBERT [CLS] | X.XX | Ys | Zms |
| SPECTER | X.XX | Ys | Zms |

**Analysis 3.2: Text Granularity Ablation**
```python
# Which parts of the paper matter most?
Features from:
- Title only
- Abstract only
- Introduction only
- Full text
- Title + Abstract
- Introduction + Conclusion
- All sections separately (multi-input model)
```

**Expected table:**

| Text Scope | F1 | ΔF1 from Full |
|------------|----|--------------| 
| Full paper | X.XX | - |
| Title + Abstract | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| Abstract only | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| Introduction only | X.XX | -Y.YY |
| Title only | X.XX | -Y.YY |

**Critical insight:** "Title + Abstract achieves 95% of full-text performance, suggesting acceptance signals are concentrated in early sections"

---

### **4. Structural Feature Deep Dive**

Reviewers will question whether structural features are meaningful or spurious.

**Analysis 4.1: Individual Structural Feature Ablation**

| Feature | Description | F1 (with) | F1 (without) | ΔF1 | p-value |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----|---------|
| Paper length | Total pages | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | <0.001 |
| Section count | # sections | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | 0.023 |
| Figure count | # figures | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | 0.156 |
| Table count | # tables | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | 0.089 |
| Equation count | # equations | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | <0.001 |
| Reference count | # citations | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | <0.001 |
| Avg section length | Words/section | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | 0.045 |
| Intro length | Intro words | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | 0.012 |

**Analysis 4.2: Correlation Analysis**
```python
# Test if structural features correlate with acceptance
For each structural feature:
- Point-biserial correlation with acceptance
- Distribution comparison (accepted vs. rejected)
- Statistical test (t-test or Mann-Whitney U)
```

**Visualization:** Box plots showing feature distributions for accepted vs. rejected papers

**Critical question to address:** "Do longer papers get accepted because they're better, or because length is a proxy for thoroughness?"

**Analysis 4.3: Confound Control**
```python
# Test if structural features add value beyond text
Models:
1. Text features only
2. Text + structural features
3. Structural features only

# Also test:
- Does structural feature importance vary by venue?
- Does it vary by research area?
```

---

### **5. Metadata Feature Scrutiny**

Metadata features (author info, citations) are controversial—reviewers will question fairness.

**Analysis 5.1: Metadata Feature Ablation**

| Metadata Feature | F1 (with) | F1 (without) | ΔF1 | Ethical Concern |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| Author count | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | Low |
| Author h-index | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | **High** |
| Institution prestige | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | **High** |
| Prior acceptance rate | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | **High** |
| Citation count | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | Medium |
| Self-citation ratio | X.XX | X.XX | Y.YY | Low |

**Critical discussion required:**
```markdown
**Ethical Considerations for Metadata Features.** While author h-index 
improves F1 by X%, using this feature raises fairness concerns as it 
disadvantages early-career researchers. We report results both with and 
without author-identifying features. For production systems, we recommend 
excluding features that could introduce bias against underrepresented groups.
```

**Analysis 5.2: Fairness Analysis**
```python
# Test for disparate impact
Stratify by:
- Author seniority (first-time vs. experienced)
- Institution tier (top-10 vs. others)
- Team size (solo vs. multi-author)

For each group:
- False positive rate
- False negative rate
- Precision/recall
```

**Report:** "Our model shows X% higher false negative rate for first-time authors, suggesting potential bias"

---

### **6. Readability and Stylistic Feature Analysis**

These features are often included but poorly validated.

**Analysis 6.1: Readability Metric Ablation**

| Readability Metric | Correlation with Acceptance | F1 Δ when removed |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | r = X.XX, p < 0.001 | -Y.YY |
| Flesch Reading Ease | r = X.XX, p = 0.023 | -Y.YY |
| Gunning Fog Index | r = X.XX, p = 0.156 | -Y.YY |
| SMOG Index | r = X.XX, p = 0.089 | -Y.YY |
| Average sentence length | r = X.XX, p < 0.001 | -Y.YY |
| Average word length | r = X.XX, p = 0.045 | -Y.YY |

**Analysis 6.2: Stylistic Feature Validation**
```python
# For each stylistic feature:
- Passive voice ratio
- Hedge word frequency ("might", "could", "possibly")
- Certainty markers ("clearly", "obviously", "definitely")
- First-person pronoun usage
- Technical term density

Test:
- Do accepted papers have different style?
- Is this venue-specific or universal?
- Does it hold across research areas?
```

**Critical insight:** "Accepted papers use X% fewer hedge words, but this effect disappears when controlling for paper quality (measured by citations), suggesting hedge words are a proxy for confidence rather than a causal factor"

---

### **7. Feature Interaction Analysis**

Reviewers will ask: Are features complementary or redundant?

**Analysis 7.1: Feature Correlation Matrix**
```python
# Compute pairwise correlations
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Identify highly correlated feature pairs (|r| > 0.7)
- Test if removing redundant features maintains performance
```

**Analysis 7.2: Feature Combination Experiments**
```python
# Test specific combinations
Models:
- Text + Structural (no metadata)
- Text + Metadata (no structural)
- Structural + Metadata (no text)
- Best single category + best complementary feature
```

**Expected finding:** "Text + Structural achieves 98% of full model performance, while Metadata adds only marginal gains (ΔF1 = 0.02), suggesting diminishing returns"

---

### **8. Venue-Specific Feature Analysis**

Features may work differently across venues.

**Analysis 8.1: Feature Importance by Venue**

| Feature | NIPS Importance | ICLR Importance | Difference |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Paper length | 0.XX | 0.YY | ±Z.ZZ |
| Equation count | 0.XX | 0.YY | ±Z.ZZ |
| Citation count | 0.XX | 0.YY | ±Z.ZZ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Interpretation:** "Equation count is highly predictive for NIPS (importance = X) but not for ICLR (importance = Y), reflecting different community norms"

**Analysis 8.2: Venue-Specific Models vs. Unified Model**
```python
# Compare:
- Separate model per venue
- Single model for all venues
- Single model with venue indicator feature
```

**Report:** "Venue-specific models improve F1 by X%, suggesting venue-specific acceptance criteria"

---

## Essential Error Analyses

### **Error Analysis 1: Confusion Matrix Deep Dive**

**Basic confusion matrix:**
```
                Predicted
              Accept | Reject
Actual Accept   TP   |   FN
       Reject   FP   |   TN
```

**Required breakdown:**
1. **False Positive Analysis** (Rejected papers predicted as Accept)
   - Sample 50-100 FP cases
   - Manually categorize error types:
     - "Borderline cases" (close to acceptance threshold)
     - "Well-written but flawed" (good presentation, weak content)
     - "Novel but risky" (innovative but unproven)
     - "Model artifacts" (gaming features like length)
   
2. **False Negative Analysis** (Accepted papers predicted as Reject)
   - Sample 50-100 FN cases
   - Categorize:
     - "Borderline accepts" (controversial decisions)
     - "Novel contributions" (model misses novelty)
     - "Influential authors" (accepted due to reputation)
     - "Underrepresented topics" (model bias toward common topics)

**Present as:**

| Error Type | FP % | FN % | Example Features |
|------------|------|------|------------------|
| Borderline cases | 35% | 42% | Scores near threshold |
| Well-written but flawed | 28% | - | High readability, low novelty |
| Novel but risky | 15% | - | Unusual methods, limited validation |
| Model misses novelty | - | 31% | Standard presentation, novel idea |
| Influential authors | - | 18% | High h-index, top institution |
| Underrepresented topics | 12% | 9% | Rare keywords |

---

### **Error Analysis 2: Confidence Calibration**

**Analysis 2.1: Calibration Curve**
```python
# For probabilistic predictions:
- Bin predictions by confidence (0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, ..., 0.9-1.0)
- Calculate actual acceptance rate in each bin
- Plot expected vs. observed
```

**Visualization:** Calibration plot with diagonal reference line

**Metrics to report:**
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
- Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)
- Brier score

**Interpretation:** "Our model is well-calibrated (ECE = 0.05), meaning predicted probabilities reflect true acceptance rates"

**Analysis 2.2: Confidence-Stratified Performance**

| Confidence Range | % of Predictions | Precision | Recall | Actual Accept Rate |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 0.9-1.0 (Very confident accept) | X% | 0.XX | 0.XX | Y% |
| 0.7-0.9 (Confident accept) | X% | 0.XX | 0.XX | Y% |
| 0.5-0.7 (Lean accept) | X% | 0.XX | 0.XX | Y% |
| 0.3-0.5 (Lean reject) | X% | 0.XX | 0.XX | Y% |
| 0.1-0.3 (Confident reject) | X% | 0.XX | 0.XX | Y% |
| 0.0-0.1 (Very confident reject) | X% | 0.XX | 0.XX | Y% |

**Critical insight:** "Model achieves 95% precision for predictions with confidence >0.9, enabling high-confidence triage"

---

### **Error Analysis 3: Stratified Performance Analysis**

Reviewers expect performance breakdown by multiple dimensions:

**Analysis 3.1: Performance by Paper Characteristics**

| Stratum | N | Precision | Recall | F1 | Notes |
|---------|---|-----------|--------|----|----|
| **By Length** |
| Short (<6 pages) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Lower performance |
| Medium (6-8 pages) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Best performance |
| Long (>8 pages) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Good performance |
| **By Topic** |
| Deep Learning | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Most common |
| Reinforcement Learning | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Good performance |
| Theory | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Lower performance |
| Applications | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Variable |
| **By Acceptance Margin** |
| Clear accept (score >4.5) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Easy cases |
| Borderline accept (3.5-4.5) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Hard cases |
| Borderline reject (2.5-3.5) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Hard cases |
| Clear reject (score <2.5) | X | 0.XX | 0.XX | 0.XX | Easy cases |

**Analysis 3.2: Performance by Venue and Year**

| Venue | Year | N | F1 | ΔF1 from Overall |
|-------|------|---|----|-----------------| 
| NIPS | 2015 | X | 0.XX | +Y.YY |
| NIPS | 2016 | X | 0.XX | +Y.YY |
| NIPS | 2017 | X | 0.XX | +Y.YY |
| ICLR | 2017 | X | 0.XX | +Y.YY |

**Interpretation:** "Performance is consistent across years (σ = 0.02) but varies by venue (NIPS F1 = X, ICLR F1 = Y)"

---

### **Error Analysis 4: Adversarial and Edge Cases**

**Analysis 4.1: Adversarial Examples**
```python
# Identify papers that "fool" the model
Cases to examine:
- High confidence FP (predicted accept >0.9, actually rejected)
- High confidence FN (predicted reject >0.9, actually accepted)
- Papers with unusual feature combinations
```

**Manual review questions:**
- What features led to high confidence?
- Were there obvious quality signals the model missed?
- Could a human have made the same mistake?

**Analysis 4.2: Edge Case Performance**
```python
# Test on unusual papers
- Very short papers (<4 pages)
- Very long papers (>12 pages)
- Papers with no equations
- Papers with no figures
- Papers with >10 authors
- Papers from underrepresented institutions
```

**Report:** "Model performance degrades for papers with <4 pages (F1 = X vs. Y overall), suggesting length bias"

---

### **Error Analysis 5: Feature Attribution for Errors**

**Analysis 5.1: SHAP Analysis of Errors**
```python
# For FP and FN cases:
- Calculate SHAP values
- Identify which features contributed most to wrong prediction
- Compare to correct predictions
```

**Visualization:** 
- SHAP summary plots for FP vs. TP
- SHAP summary plots for FN vs. TN

**Insight:** "FP cases are driven by high readability scores (SHAP = +X) despite low novelty, suggesting model over-weights presentation"

**Analysis 5.2: Counterfactual Analysis**
```python
# For error cases, ask:
- What feature changes would flip the prediction?
- Are these changes realistic?
- Do they align with human judgment?
```

**Example:** "For FP case #42, reducing paper length from 10 to 7 pages would flip prediction to reject, but length alone shouldn't determine acceptance"

---

## Specific Ablations for Common PeerRead Features

Based on typical PeerRead implementations, here are feature-specific ablations reviewers will expect:

### **N-gram Features**
```python
Ablations:
- Unigrams only
- Unigrams + bigrams
- Unigrams + bigrams + trigrams
- Character n-grams (3-5 chars)

Vocabulary size variations:
- Top 1K features
- Top 5K features
- Top 10K features
- Top 50K features
```

**Expected finding:** "Bigrams add X% F1 over unigrams, but trigrams add only Y%, suggesting diminishing returns"

### **Embedding Features**
```python
Ablations:
- Embedding dimension (50, 100, 200, 300)
- Pooling strategy (mean, max, attention-weighted)
- Pre-trained vs. domain-specific embeddings
- Contextualized (BERT) vs. static (Word2Vec)
```

### **Citation Features**
```python
Ablations:
- Raw citation count
- Citation count normalized by paper age
- Citation count normalized by field
- Citation velocity (citations per year)
- Self-citation ratio
- Citation to high-impact venues
```

**Critical question:** "Do citations predict acceptance, or do accepted papers get more citations? (Causality concern)"

### **Linguistic Complexity Features**
```python
Ablations:
- Lexical diversity (type-token ratio)
- Syntactic complexity (parse tree depth)
- Discourse markers (however, therefore, etc.)
- Technical term density
- Jargon ratio
```

## Recommended Results Section Structure

```markdown
## 4. Ablation Studies

### 4.1 Feature Category Ablations

Table X shows performance with each feature category removed. Textual features 
contribute most to performance (ΔF1 = -X.XX when removed), followed by 
structural features (ΔF1 = -Y.YY). Readability features contribute minimally 
(ΔF1 = -Z.ZZ), suggesting they are largely redundant with textual features.

[Table from Analysis 1]

Statistical significance testing (McNemar's test, p < 0.001) confirms that 
textual and structural features significantly improve over text-only baselines.

### 4.2 Individual Feature Importance

Figure X shows the top 20 features by permutation importance. The most 
predictive features are:
1. [Feature name]: [Interpretation]
2. [Feature name]: [Interpretation]
...

[Feature importance visualization]

Notably, [surprising finding, e.g., "paper length ranks 3rd, suggesting 
thoroughness is valued, but this may also reflect a bias toward longer papers"].

### 4.3 Text Representation Comparison

Table Y compares different text encoding strategies. SciBERT achieves the 
highest F1 (X.XX), outperforming generic BERT (Y.YY) and traditional TF-IDF 
(Z.ZZ). However, TF-IDF achieves 90% of SciBERT's performance with 100x 
faster inference, suggesting a practical trade-off.

[Table from Analysis 3.1]

### 4.4 Text Granularity Analysis

Surprisingly, title + abstract achieves F1 = X.XX, only Y.YY below full-text 
performance (Z.ZZ). This suggests acceptance signals are concentrated in early 
sections, enabling efficient screening without reading full papers.

[Table from Analysis 3.2]

### 4.5 Structural Feature Analysis

Figure Y shows distributions of structural features for accepted vs. rejected 
papers. Accepted papers are significantly longer (p < 0.001), have more 
equations (p < 0.001), and more references (p < 0.001). However, figure count 
does not differ significantly (p = 0.156).

[Box plots from Analysis 4.2]

Ablating structural features reduces F1 by X.XX, but this effect is entirely 
explained by paper length and reference count—removing other structural 
features has negligible impact (ΔF1 < 0.01).

### 4.6 Metadata Feature Ethics

While author h-index improves F1 by X.XX, we exclude it from our recommended 
model due to fairness concerns. Fairness analysis (Section 5.3) shows that 
including h-index increases false negative rate for first-time authors by Y%.

[Table from Analysis 5.1]

## 5. Error Analysis

### 5.1 Confusion Matrix Analysis

Our model achieves precision = X.XX and recall = Y.YY on the test set. Manual 
analysis of 100 false positives and 100 false negatives reveals:

**False Positives (predicted accept, actually rejected):**
- 35% borderline cases (reviewer scores near threshold)
- 28% well-written but methodologically flawed
- 15% novel but high-risk approaches
- 22% other

**False Negatives (predicted reject, actually accepted):**
- 42% borderline accepts (controversial decisions)
- 31% novel contributions model failed to recognize
- 18% papers from influential authors
- 9% underrepresented topics

[Table from Error Analysis 1]

### 5.2 Calibration Analysis

Figure Z shows our model is well-calibrated (ECE = 0.05). Predictions with 
confidence >0.9 achieve 95% precision, enabling high-confidence triage.

[Calibration plot from Error Analysis 2.1]

### 5.3 Stratified Performance

Performance varies by paper characteristics:
- **Length**: Best for medium-length papers (6-8 pages, F1 = X.XX), worse 
  for very short (<4 pages, F1 = Y.YY)
- **Topic**: Best for deep learning (F1 = X.XX), worse for theory (F1 = Y.YY)
- **Acceptance margin**: Excellent for clear cases (F1 = X.XX), poor for 
  borderline (F1 = Y.YY)

[Table from Error Analysis 3.1]

This suggests our model is most useful for screening clear accepts/rejects, 
but borderline cases still require human judgment.
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Feature category ablations are non-negotiable**—reviewers will reject papers that don't show which features matter

2. **Individual feature importance is critical**—don't just report aggregate performance, show which specific features drive predictions

3. **Text representation matters**—compare multiple approaches and justify your choice

4. **Metadata features require ethical scrutiny**—if you use author/institution features, you MUST address fairness

5. **Error analysis should be qualitative AND quantitative**—numbers alone aren't enough; manually inspect errors

6. **Stratified analysis reveals biases**—show performance across different paper types, not just overall

7. **Calibration analysis demonstrates reliability**—reviewers want to know if your confidence scores are meaningful

8. **Be honest about limitations**—if certain features are problematic (e.g., length bias), acknowledge and discuss

The goal is to demonstrate that you understand what your model is learning, not just that it achieves good aggregate performance. Reviewers want to see thoughtful analysis, not just high numbers.
