I'd be happy to help evaluate your idea! To give you the most useful feedback, I need to understand what you're proposing.

**Could you share:**
1. **The core idea**: What specific biological data are you working with (sequences, images, graphs, time-series)? What task or question are you trying to solve with transformers?
2. **Your motivation**: What gap or limitation in current approaches would this address?
3. **Initial thoughts on approach**: Any specific transformer architecture or adaptation you're considering?

**Before we dive deep, let me also gather some context to tailor my advice:**

- **Resources**: What's your compute access like (local GPU, cloud credits, cluster)? How many hours per week can you dedicate to this?
- **Background**: Are you currently in a course, working on a thesis, or exploring independently? What's your experience level with transformers and biological data?
- **Collaboration**: Do you have advisor/mentor support? Access to domain experts in biology?
- **Timeline**: Any target deadlines or milestones (conference submission, thesis defense, etc.)?
- **Biggest bottleneck**: What feels like the hardest part right now—getting data, choosing the right architecture, evaluation, or something else?

Once I understand your specific idea and context, I can help assess viability, identify potential pitfalls, suggest concrete experiments, and point you toward relevant recent work.
