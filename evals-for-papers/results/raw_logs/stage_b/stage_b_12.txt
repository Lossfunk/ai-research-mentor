Stage: B – Idea

Short answer
- Novelty: Moderately novel. Confidence calibration and abstention/deferral for LLMs are active areas, but they’ve been studied mostly in general QA or safety settings, not rigorously in community-college tutoring with learning outcomes and equity measures. A study that couples calibrated confidence with deferral-to-human in a real course would likely be new and valuable. [P5][P7]
- Baselines: You’ll want (a) a strong uncalibrated LLM tutor, (b) an established tutoring/control used in community colleges (e.g., human tutoring center hours or a mainstream adaptive platform like ALEKS for college algebra), and (c) ablative LLM variants: self-evaluation gating, conformal abstention, and “ask-for-calibration.” [P5][P7]

Strategic questions
1) Which course(s) and domain will you target first (e.g., College Algebra, Intro Writing, Intro CS)? 2) Do you have access to a community college partner and IRB support for at least a pilot in one section? 3) What’s your compute and time budget for a 10–12 week semester study? 4) What is your primary outcome metric (concept inventory, course pass rate) and your calibration metric (Brier/ECE) target?

Recommendations
- Baseline stack
  - Educational: status quo course (business-as-usual) and/or human tutoring center hours; if math, include an adaptive platform baseline (e.g., ALEKS) to represent today’s “best available” at scale. This anchors effect sizes to what administrators recognize.
  - LLM: strong “vanilla” tutor (few-shot+CoT+Socratic hints) without explicit calibration; “ask-for-calibration” prompting as in Stąpor et al. (calibrated confidence elicitation) [P5]; and abstention/deferral using conformal methods [P7]. Include a self-evaluation/reflection variant that reduces hallucinations before giving help [P6].
- Primary metrics: learning gains (pre/post or unit concept inventory), pass rate/DFW, Brier score and ECE of confidence vs. correctness, deferral rate, time-on-task, and subgroup equity gaps.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Calibrated vs. uncalibrated LLM tutor
   - Hypothesis: A calibrated tutor (explicit confidence + refusal when uncertain) yields equal or better learning gains with fewer high-confidence errors than an uncalibrated tutor. [P5][P7]
   - Setup: Randomize students within a course section to Calibrated vs. Uncalibrated LLM tutor for weekly problem sets. Keep prompts, content, and access constant; only add confidence display + abstention/deferral policy to the calibrated arm.
   - Metrics: Pre/post test gain (primary), Brier and ECE on item-level correctness, rate of high-confidence wrong answers, student trust ratings.
   - Expected outcome: Calibrated arm reduces high-confidence errors and improves Brier/ECE without harming learning. Falsifier: learning significantly worse or calibration not improved.
   - Follow-ups: Vary confidence display (numeric vs. verbal band); add instructor “second look” for abstentions.

2) Deferral policy design: conformal abstention vs. heuristic refusal
   - Hypothesis: Conformal abstention achieves better risk control (fewer critical errors at fixed coverage) than heuristic rules. [P7]
   - Setup: Same course; alternate weeks with conformal thresholding vs. heuristic deferral (e.g., logprob/entropy threshold). When deferring, route to human TA or vetted resource.
   - Metrics: Coverage–risk curve, selective accuracy, abstention rate, learning gains, TA load.
   - Expected outcome: Conformal method yields lower error at matched coverage. Falsifier: no improvement or higher TA burden for same error rate.
   - Follow-ups: Tune target risk; compare per-topic calibration drift.

3) Calibration method ablation in tutoring context
   - Hypothesis: “Just ask for calibration” prompting improves Brier/ECE and selective risk more than simple temperature scaling; adding self-evaluation further reduces hallucinations. [P5][P6]
   - Setup: Within the LLM tutor, compare: (a) vanilla, (b) temperature scaling, (c) ask-for-calibration prompting, (d) ask-for-calibration + self-evaluation critique before final hint.
   - Metrics: Brier/ECE, selective accuracy at fixed abstention, instructor-rated factuality/helpfulness, student outcomes on knowledge-intensive items.
   - Expected outcome: (c) > (b) > (a) on Brier/ECE; (d) reduces factual errors with minimal latency overhead. Falsifier: no ordering or degraded learning.

Phase 0 (≤14 days) gates
- Deliverables: (1) One reproduced calibration benchmark with your chosen LLM showing Brier/ECE and a coverage–risk curve; (2) An experiment card for Experiment 1 plus one ablation (e.g., turning off deferral) and a brief post-mortem.
- If gates aren’t met, iterate on evaluation harness before running a class pilot.

Intuition
- Tutors that know when they don’t know prevent confident mistakes and direct students to better help. Calibrated confidence plus principled abstention gives students trustworthy signals and routes edge cases to humans.

Why this is principled
- Elicited confidence and post-hoc calibration methods can substantially improve probability estimates in LLMs [P5], and conformal abstention offers distribution-free risk control for “answer vs. defer” choices [P7]. Self-evaluation steps reduce hallucinations, improving fidelity in knowledge tasks [P6].

Next actions
- Pick one course and partner; draft the Experiment 1 card; assemble a minimal evaluation harness for Brier/ECE; and confirm IRB feasibility.
