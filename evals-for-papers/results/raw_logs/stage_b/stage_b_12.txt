Short answer
- Novelty: Partially novel. Calibration/uncertainty for LLMs is an active area, and LLM tutoring has been explored, but uncertainty-aware tutoring policies (e.g., calibrated confidence display, risk-controlled refusal, or handoff-to-human) evaluated specifically with community college learners appear underexplored. Your contribution can be novel if you (1) implement and validate calibration-aware tutoring policies, and (2) run a rigorous field or classroom study with community college populations, reporting both learning and calibration outcomes [P5][P1][P8].
- Baselines to compare:
  1) Non-calibrated LLM tutor (status quo chat-tutor with no confidence signal).
  2) Post-hoc calibrated LLM tutor (e.g., “Just Ask for Calibration” style elicitation/temperature scaling) [P5].
  3) Multi-agent/deliberation tutor (self-consistency or multi-agent debate where confidence is derived from vote agreements) [P1].
  4) Listener-aware calibrated tutor (explicit confidence phrasing aligned to learner’s needs) [P8].

What makes it meaningfully novel
- LLMs are often miscalibrated/overconfident; explicit strategies to elicit calibrated confidence exist but are rarely tied to pedagogical policies (e.g., when to abstain or defer, how to scaffold differently at low confidence) [P5]. Multi-agent approaches can improve calibration and provide rationales, which you can translate into tutoring policies (e.g., “I’m only 0.6 confident; here’s how we can verify”) [P1]. Listener-aware calibration emphasizes how confidence is communicated to a specific learner, which is directly relevant in tutoring [P8]. A carefully measured deployment in community colleges (a distinct student population with different prior knowledge and resource constraints) would add real value.

Recommended baselines and metrics
- System variants (as above): no-calibration; post-hoc calibrated; multi-agent; listener-aware calibrated.
- Key metrics:
  - Calibration: ECE, Brier score, calibration plots; selective risk/coverage curves under abstention thresholds [P5].
  - Accuracy and safety: answer correctness; hallucination exposure rate; refusal appropriateness; handoff rate to human TA.
  - Learning/UX: pre–post learning gains; near/far transfer items; time-on-task; help-seeking behaviors; trust and perceived reliability.
  - Cost/latency: tokens, response time; multi-agent overhead vs. benefits [P1].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Does better calibration improve learning?
   - Hypothesis: A calibrated tutor yields higher pre–post gains than an otherwise identical uncalibrated tutor, mediated by reduced exposure to high-confidence errors.
   - Conditions: A) No-calibration tutor; B) Post-hoc calibrated tutor using elicited probabilities/temperature scaling [P5].
   - Population: Intro algebra or A&P students in a community college section.
   - Metrics: ECE, Brier; pre–post test gains; fraction of high-confidence wrong answers; help-seeking rate.
   - Expected outcome: B outperforms A on gains and reduces high-confidence wrong exposures without increasing time-on-task [P5].

2) When should the tutor abstain or hand off?
   - Hypothesis: A calibrated abstention policy (answer only if p(correct) ≥ τ; otherwise guide verification or hand off) reduces hallucination exposure while preserving learning.
   - Conditions: A) Always-answer; B) Thresholded abstention with calibrated probabilities [P5]; C) Multi-agent agreement proxy for confidence (e.g., majority vote) [P1].
   - Metrics: Selective accuracy vs. coverage; learning gains; number and outcomes of handoffs; student satisfaction.
   - Expected outcome: B and C achieve higher selective accuracy at matched coverage than A; C may gain extra calibration from agreement signals but with higher cost [P1].

3) How confidence language affects novice learners
   - Hypothesis: Listener-aware confidence phrasing (clear numeric/linguistic confidence plus next-step guidance) improves trust calibration (students rely on high-confidence answers, scrutinize low-confidence ones) and learning, relative to numeric confidence alone.
   - Conditions: A) Numeric confidence only; B) Listener-aware phrasing and scaffolding (e.g., “I’m only somewhat confident; let’s check with a worked example”) [P8].
   - Metrics: Student trust calibration (agreement/use conditional on model confidence), ECE of student decisions, learning gains, perceived clarity.
   - Expected outcome: B improves student trust calibration and equal or better learning vs. A [P8].

4) Cost-effectiveness of multi-agent calibration
   - Hypothesis: Multi-agent deliberation improves calibration more than simple post-hoc scaling, but not enough to justify latency/cost in low-stakes tasks; it is justified in higher-stakes problem sets.
   - Conditions: A) Post-hoc calibrated tutor [P5]; B) Multi-agent deliberation tutor [P1].
   - Metrics: ECE/Brier; correctness; token/time cost; incremental gain per 1,000 tokens.
   - Expected outcome: B has better calibration; the breakeven depends on task difficulty and error cost [P1][P5].

Practical next steps
- Start with a within-course A/B test over one unit to estimate effect sizes; pre-register and plan IRB if classroom deployment.
- Implement a minimal calibrated confidence pipeline (elicited probabilities + temperature scaling) and a simple abstention policy before adding multi-agent methods [P5].
- Instrument fine-grained logs to compute ECE/Brier and selective risk; segment results by prior knowledge to see who benefits most.
- Report both learning and calibration metrics; include ablations (confidence display vs. policy vs. both).
