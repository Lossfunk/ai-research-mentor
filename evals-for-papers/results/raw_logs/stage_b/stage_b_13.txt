**Intuition**: Smallholder farmers need decision-support, not model internals. The innovation space lies in ultra-constrained interaction design (160 chars, no data plan) that surfaces *actionable* uncertainty rather than generic feature importance.

**Why this is principled**: HCI literature shows explainability must match user mental models and task structure [G1]. For low-literacy, offline users this means translating model confidence into *risk* language they already use ("3/5 seasons this advice failed when rains came early") rather than technical attributions.
