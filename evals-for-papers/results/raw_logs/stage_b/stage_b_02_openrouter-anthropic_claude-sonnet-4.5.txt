The term "compressible LLMs" is **ambiguous**—LLM compression is a very active field with extensive existing work [1,2,3]. To assess novelty, I need to understand what you mean:

## What do you mean by "compressible"?

1. **Post-training compression** (pruning, quantization, distillation)? This is well-established [1,2,3,4,5].
2. **Architecture designed for compressibility**? Models with built-in compression mechanisms during training?
3. **Dynamic/adaptive compression**? Models that compress themselves based on task or context?
4. **Lossless compression of weights/activations**? Exploiting redundancy for storage/transmission?
5. **Something else entirely**?

## Existing Landscape

- **Pruning & distillation**: Minitron [4], compact models via knowledge distillation [3]
- **Quantization**: Extensive benchmarking exists (LLMC toolkit [5])
- **Tensor decomposition**: Quantum-inspired tensor networks for extreme compression [2]
- **Surveys**: Multiple comprehensive surveys published in 2023-2024 [1,6]

## Potential Novelty Angles (depending on your definition)

- **Training-time compressibility**: Architectures that learn to be compressible (e.g., learned sparsity patterns, hierarchical representations)
- **Task-adaptive compression**: Different compression ratios for different tasks/queries
- **Compression-aware pretraining**: Objectives that explicitly encourage compressibility
- **Novel compression metrics**: Beyond parameter count—energy, latency, memory bandwidth

## Concrete Tests You Should Run

### 1. **Baseline Comparisons** (Essential)
- Compare against standard compression methods (pruning, quantization, distillation) on the same base model
- Metrics: perplexity, downstream task accuracy (GLUE, MMLU, etc.), compression ratio, inference speed

### 2. **Ablation Studies** (Critical for novelty claims)
- Isolate which component of your approach drives performance
- Test: Does your method work across different model sizes (1B, 7B, 13B+)?
- Test: Does it generalize across architectures (GPT-style, BERT-style, mixture-of-experts)?

### 3. **Compression-Performance Tradeoffs**
- Plot accuracy vs. compression ratio curves
- Compare to Pareto frontier of existing methods
- Measure at multiple compression levels (2x, 4x, 8x, 16x)

### 4. **Efficiency Metrics** (Beyond accuracy)
- **Inference latency**: Wall-clock time per token
- **Memory footprint**: Peak GPU/CPU memory during inference
- **Energy consumption**: If feasible, measure actual power draw
- **Throughput**: Tokens/second at different batch sizes

### 5. **Robustness Tests**
- Does compression degrade performance unevenly across domains?
- Test on out-of-distribution data
- Check for bias amplification after compression

### 6. **Compression Stability**
- Can you compress → fine-tune → compress again?
- Does compression hurt few-shot learning ability?

## What You Need to Clarify

**Before running experiments, define:**
1. What makes your LLMs "compressible" vs. existing compression techniques?
2. Is this a training method, architecture, or post-processing technique?
3. What's the target use case (edge deployment, cost reduction, faster inference)?

Once you clarify, I can suggest more targeted experiments and help identify specific gaps in the literature.
