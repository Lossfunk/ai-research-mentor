I can help assess the viability of your idea, but I need more specifics. **"Biology datasets with transformers" is extremely broad**—this combination is already widely used across many subfields with varying levels of maturity.

## What Already Exists (Very Active Areas)

Transformers are extensively applied to biological data:

### 1. **Protein Sequences**
- **ESM, ProtBERT, AlphaFold2**: Protein language models, structure prediction
- **Viability**: Mature field, high bar for novelty

### 2. **DNA/RNA Sequences**
- **DNABERT, Nucleotide Transformer, Enformer**: Genomic sequence modeling, regulatory element prediction
- **Viability**: Active research, but crowded

### 3. **Single-Cell Genomics**
- **scBERT, Geneformer**: Cell type classification, gene expression modeling
- **Viability**: Rapidly growing, opportunities remain

### 4. **Medical Imaging + Omics**
- **Vision transformers** for pathology, radiology; multimodal fusion
- **Viability**: High impact potential, requires domain expertise

### 5. **Drug Discovery**
- **MolFormer, ChemBERTa**: Molecular property prediction, generation
- **Viability**: Commercially valuable, competitive

### 6. **Biological Networks**
- **Graph transformers** for protein-protein interaction, metabolic networks
- **Viability**: Emerging, less saturated

## To Assess Viability, I Need to Know:

### 1. **What type of biological data?**
- Sequences (DNA, RNA, protein)?
- Images (microscopy, pathology, radiology)?
- Tabular (gene expression, clinical records)?
- Graphs (interaction networks, phylogenies)?
- Time series (physiological signals, population dynamics)?
- Multimodal combinations?

### 2. **What's the task?**
- Classification (disease diagnosis, cell type identification)?
- Prediction (protein function, drug response)?
- Generation (molecule design, sequence synthesis)?
- Representation learning (embeddings for downstream tasks)?
- Interpretation (identifying biomarkers, causal factors)?

### 3. **What's your specific angle?**
- Novel architecture modification for biological data?
- New pretraining strategy?
- Applying transformers to an underexplored dataset/domain?
- Multimodal fusion approach?
- Interpretability/explainability focus?
- Efficiency (smaller models, less data)?

### 4. **What resources do you have?**
- Access to unique/proprietary datasets?
- Computational resources (GPUs, TPUs)?
- Domain expertise (biology background, collaborators)?
- Coding experience (see your earlier question—still relevant)?

### 5. **What's the gap you're addressing?**
- "Existing methods fail at X because Y"
- "This biological problem hasn't been tackled with transformers because Z"
- "Current transformer approaches don't account for W"

## Quick Viability Framework

**High viability if:**
- ✅ You have access to unique, high-quality data
- ✅ There's a clear gap in existing methods
- ✅ You have domain expertise or collaborators
- ✅ The task has measurable impact (clinical, scientific, commercial)
- ✅ You can start with a simple baseline and iterate

**Low viability if:**
- ❌ The exact combination has been done (check recent papers)
- ❌ You lack data or computational resources
- ❌ The biological problem is poorly defined
- ❌ You're applying transformers "because they're popular" without clear motivation
- ❌ You have no coding experience and no collaborators (per your sea ice question)

## What You Should Do Right Now

**1. Describe your idea more specifically:**
- "I want to use transformers to [task] on [data type] for [biological problem]"
- Example: "I want to use transformers to predict drug resistance from bacterial genome sequences"

**2. Do a quick literature search:**
- Google Scholar: "[your data type] transformer [your task]"
- Check if it's been done; if so, what are the limitations?

**3. Identify your unique contribution:**
- New data? New method? New application? Better performance? Better interpretability?

**Once you provide these details, I can:**
- Assess novelty more precisely
- Suggest specific baselines and experiments
- Point to relevant papers and benchmarks
- Identify potential pitfalls
- Recommend concrete next steps

**So: What's the specific idea?** Give me the data type, task, and what you think makes it interesting/novel.
