Short answer: Partly novel. There is at least one graph-based sea‑ice forecasting paper (GraphSIFNet using a GCLSTM for sub‑seasonal sea‑ice concentration/presence in Hudson Bay), so the basic idea has precedent [P1]. Most prominent sea‑ice forecasting work (e.g., IceNet) relies on CNNs/probabilistic deep learning rather than graph nets, suggesting the GNN space is underexplored relative to CNNs/transformers in this domain [P2]. Closely related applications of GNNs exist in ocean forecasting and cryosphere emulation, indicating feasibility but leaving room for novel modeling choices and evaluations in sea‑ice forecasting specifically [P8][P9].

Where your work can be novel
- Dynamic graph topology reflecting ice motion: Build edges from recent drift fields rather than static grids; this is not addressed by IceNet and is a natural advantage for GNNs [P2].  
- Multiscale/hierarchical graphs on irregular meshes or spherical grids: Leverage hierarchical pooling and mesh-aware message passing as in recent ocean GNNs, but for sea ice [P8].  
- Probabilistic and calibrated GNNs: Deliver calibrated uncertainty comparable to IceNet’s probabilistic outputs, which is not yet established for sea-ice GNNs [P2].  
- Multi-task sea-ice targets: Jointly predict SIC, SIT, and drift; SIT forecasting has been done with CNNs but not broadly with GNNs [P3].  
- Cross-basin generalization and transfer (Arctic→Antarctic), and OOD robustness analyses—areas not well covered for GNNs in sea ice [P1][P2].  
- Physics- or conservation-aware losses (e.g., penalizing non-physical area/volume changes), which are not standard in existing deep learning baselines [P2][P3].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Dynamic-graph vs static-grid GNN for SIC forecasting  
- Hypothesis: A graph with time-varying edges derived from recent ice drift improves multi-day SIC and ice-edge skill in the marginal ice zone over a static-neighbor graph.  
- Setup: Train a GCLSTM/Graph Transformer on daily OSI-SAF/NSIDC SIC with ERA5 forcings; construct edges from 2–7 day drift estimates; compare to the same model with fixed k-NN geodesic neighbors.  
- Metrics: RMSE/MAE for SIC, ice-edge F1/precision-recall, and lead-time skill at 3/7/14/30 days; regional breakdown (MIZ vs pack).  
- Expected outcome: Dynamic edges yield higher edge skill and lower RMSE at 7–14 days. This would extend beyond GraphSIFNet’s fixed topology case study and probe a hypothesized advantage of GNNs for advective processes [P1].

2) Hierarchical graph nets vs strong CNN/transformer baselines  
- Hypothesis: A hierarchical GNN with multiscale pooling on an irregular mesh matches or exceeds IceNet-style CNN baselines for 1–6 month SIC forecasts at 25 km, especially in coastal/complex-geometry regions.  
- Setup: Replicate IceNet’s setup (monthly averages, 25 km grid, climate+observational training mix) and add a hierarchical graph model inspired by recent ocean GNNs; hold out years and perform Arctic-only training with Antarctic transfer test [P2][P8].  
- Metrics: CRPS, reliability diagrams, ice-edge distance error, and regional skill; significance via paired block-bootstrap.  
- Expected outcome: Comparable or better coastal/ice-edge skill with improved calibration or generalization; demonstrates a structural advantage of graphs on irregular domains [P2][P8].

3) Probabilistic GNNs and multi-task learning (SIC+SIT+drift)  
- Hypothesis: A probabilistic multi-task GNN improves SIT and drift skill versus single-task CNN surrogates and maintains calibrated SIC probabilities similar to IceNet.  
- Setup: Train a shared-encoder GNN with distributional heads (e.g., Gaussian/quantile) for SIC, SIT, and drift; compare to (a) single-task SIC GNN, (b) CNN SIT surrogate (U‑Net-like), and (c) IceNet for probabilistic SIC baselines [P2][P3].  
- Metrics: For SIC: CRPS, reliability; for SIT: RMSE/robust loss; for drift: vector RMSE and bearing error; multi-task ablation and calibration curves.  
- Expected outcome: Multi-task regularization reduces SIT error and preserves SIC calibration, supporting the value of graph-based inductive bias for coupled targets [P2][P3].

What to do first
- Reproduce GraphSIFNet on a public dataset (not just Hudson Bay) to establish a GNN baseline and identify gaps in generalization and calibration [P1].  
- Establish strong non-graph baselines (IceNet-style probabilistic CNNs) to ensure any gains are meaningful and not due to training setup [P2].  
- If pursuing novelty, prioritize dynamic graphs and hierarchical meshes, and design evaluations that emphasize coastal/MIZ skill, OOD generalization, and uncertainty quality [P2][P8].

Key takeaway: Using graph nets for sea‑ice forecasting is not entirely novel, but the space is far from saturated; you can make a clear contribution by focusing on dynamic/mesh-aware graph design, probabilistic calibration, and rigorous cross-basin and edge-focused evaluations anchored to strong baselines [P1][P2][P8].
