Short answer: Partially novel. A few recent studies have applied graph neural networks to sea‑ice forecasting, so the idea itself isn’t new, but the space is still early and specific problem framings, datasets, constraints, or uncertainty modeling choices can be novel and impactful.

What’s been done
- IceGAT: a multi‑scale graph attention network with conservation constraints for pan‑Arctic sea‑ice concentration prediction, showing benefits from graph structure and physics‑inspired losses [P1][P8].  
- GraphSIFNet: a GNN with GCLSTM for daily sub‑seasonal (up to 90‑day) sea‑ice forecasts in Hudson Bay, indicating feasibility but in a regional, not pan‑Arctic, setting [P2][P7].  
- Strong non‑graph baselines: IceNet (UNet‑style CNN) for probabilistic seasonal SIC forecasts [P3]; global operator/transformer baselines like FourCastNet [P5]. GraphCast uses a multi‑scale graph for global weather but not sea‑ice specifically, illustrating the promise of graph meshes for geophysical fields [P4].  
- Methodological guidance/benchmarks: WeatherBench2 standardizes verification for data‑driven weather; its metrics and evaluation discipline are useful to emulate (e.g., consistent lead-time stratification and reliability analysis), even if sea‑ice isn’t a built‑in target there [P6].

Where novelty likely remains
- Graph construction: dynamic edges informed by ocean/ice drift, tidal currents, or deformation fields (vs static geodesic adjacency) [P1][P4].  
- Physics‑informed objectives: stricter conservation/positivity/monotonicity constraints for SIC and thickness beyond what IceGAT explored [P1].  
- Probabilistic calibration: well‑calibrated uncertainty for extremes, coastal zones, and melt/freeze transitions (IceNet emphasized probabilistic skill; doing this with GNNs remains underexplored) [P3].  
- Task scope: multi‑task forecasts (SIC, drift, thickness) and pan‑Arctic, multi‑horizon evaluation with robust baselines (IceNet, FourCastNet) [P3][P5].  
- Mesh/resolution: unstructured/coastline‑aware meshes or multi‑scale graphs tailored to the marginal ice zone, inspired by GraphCast’s multi‑scale design [P4].  

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) GNN vs CNN baseline for pan‑Arctic SIC
- Hypothesis: A multi‑scale GNN with coastline‑aware graph and dynamic edges from prior‑day drift reduces coastal RMSE and ice‑edge error vs a UNet (IceNet‑style) at 1–6 month leads.  
- Data: OSI‑SAF/NSIDC SIC, ERA5 predictors; train 1993–2015, test 2016–2022.  
- Models: (a) UNet baseline (IceNet‑like) [P3], (b) GNN with multi‑scale graph and attention (IceGAT‑like) [P1].  
- Metrics: RMSE, integrated ice‑edge error (IIEE) and reliability/Brier for presence/absence as in IceNet [P3]; stratify by region (marginal ice zone) and season.  
- Expected outcome: If dynamic edges help, GNN outperforms UNet in coastal/marginal zones at medium leads; otherwise differences will be negligible—both outcomes are informative.

2) Physics‑informed loss ablation
- Hypothesis: Adding conservation and boundedness constraints (e.g., penalize negative/ >100% SIC, regional mass budget drift) improves long‑lead stability and reduces extreme errors vs a purely data‑driven GNN.  
- Models: Same GNN with/without conservation losses (following IceGAT’s conservation idea but extending to regional mass budgets) [P1].  
- Metrics: Fraction of physically invalid predictions, CRPS for probabilistic outputs, tail error quantiles in rapid melt/freeze periods.  
- Expected outcome: Constrained model shows fewer violations and better CRPS at 3–6 month leads; if not, report trade‑offs (e.g., slight mean error increase).

3) Static vs dynamic vs learned graph connectivity
- Hypothesis: Connectivity informed by ice drift fields (dynamic k‑NN on advected positions) yields lower IIEE during break‑up/freeze‑up than static geodesic k‑NN or globally learned attention alone.  
- Variants: (a) Static geodesic graph, (b) Drift‑informed dynamic graph, (c) Fully learned attention without explicit edges [P1][P4].  
- Metrics: IIEE, coastal RMSE, spatial skill maps; seasonal breakdown.  
- Expected outcome: Drift‑informed dynamic graph improves skill during high‑advection periods; if not, attention alone may suffice—insight into the value of explicit dynamics.

Optional 4th experiment (uncertainty):  
- Probabilistic calibration of a GNN (e.g., quantile regression or deep ensemble) vs IceNet.  
- Hypothesis: GNN can match or exceed IceNet’s reliability for presence/absence and SIC quantiles while improving spatial sharpness [P3].  
- Metrics: CRPS, reliability diagrams, sharpness vs coverage.

Next steps
- Reproduce IceGAT on your data domain, then extend to dynamic edges and stricter physics losses [P1].  
- Benchmark against IceNet and FourCastNet baselines for fair comparison and report skill by region/season, with IIEE and reliability as in IceNet [P3][P5].  
- Document evaluation following WeatherBench2 practices (consistent datasets, lead times, and verification scripts) [P6].
