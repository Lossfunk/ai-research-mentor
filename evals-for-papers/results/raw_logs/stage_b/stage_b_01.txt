**Intuition**: Graph networks for sea-ice forecasting sits in a promising intersection—spatiotemporal GNNs have shown strong results in related geophysical forecasting tasks [P2][P7], but sea-ice presents unique challenges (dynamic boundaries, multi-scale physics, sparse observations) that aren't well-addressed in existing literature.

**Why this is principled**: The novelty assessment follows Hamming's principle of working on problems where you have unique advantage or perspective [G8]. Since current spatiotemporal GNN work focuses on traffic [P6], pandemics [P3][P5], and general weather [P2][P10], sea-ice forecasting represents an underexplored domain with distinct physical constraints.

## Strategic Questions

1. **What's your access to sea-ice data?** Do you have NSIDC, ECMWF, or other gridded datasets with temporal coverage? The quality and resolution of your data will determine feasible graph constructions.

2. **What temporal and spatial scales matter for your application?** Daily vs. seasonal forecasting and regional vs. pan-Arctic scales require different graph architectures and evaluation frameworks.

3. **Do you have domain expertise or collaboration access?** Understanding sea-ice thermodynamics and atmospheric coupling is crucial for meaningful graph construction and feature engineering.

## Novelty Assessment

**Likely novel but needs verification**: While spatiotemporal GNNs are well-studied for general weather forecasting [P2][P10], I found no specific applications to sea-ice forecasting in recent literature. The closest work is hydrological forecasting [P7], but sea-ice involves different physics (phase transitions, mechanical stress, albedo feedback).

**Key differentiation opportunities**:
- **Dynamic graph construction**: Sea-ice boundaries change dramatically, requiring adaptive graph structures
- **Multi-scale physics integration**: Incorporate thermodynamic and mechanical processes into message passing
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Critical for operational forecasting in climate applications

## Three Concrete Experiments

**Experiment 1: Baseline Comparison**
Objective: Establish whether GNNs outperform traditional methods for regional sea-ice extent prediction. Hypothesis: Spatiotemporal GNNs will achieve >15% improvement in RMSE over persistence baseline for 7-day forecasts. Setup: Use NSIDC daily sea-ice concentration data, construct 6-neighbor grid graphs, implement standard ST-GNN architecture [P2]. Metrics: RMSE, MAE, Brier score for ice presence. Expected: GNNs show advantage for complex coastal regions but may underperform in open ocean.

**Experiment 2: Graph Construction Ablation**
Objective: Determine optimal graph structure for sea-ice dynamics. Hypothesis: Physics-informed graphs (connecting cells based on ice drift, wind patterns) outperform simple grid graphs by >20%. Setup: Compare grid graphs, k-nearest neighbors, and physics-informed connectivity using same GNN backbone. Metrics: Forecast accuracy, computational efficiency, sensitivity to graph density. Expected: Physics-informed graphs excel during melt season when dynamics matter most.

**Experiment 3: Multi-Task Learning**
Objective: Simultaneously forecast multiple sea-ice variables to improve performance through shared representations. Hypothesis: Joint prediction of ice concentration, thickness, and motion improves concentration forecasts by >10%. Setup: Multi-head GNN architecture with shared encoder and task-specific decoders. Metrics: Per-task accuracy, training efficiency, representation quality via t-SNE visualization. Expected: Multi-task helps most for thickness prediction, with smaller gains for concentration.

## Next Actions (Phase 0 - 14 days)

1. **Literature deep-dive**: Search specifically for "sea ice graph neural network" and "Arctic forecasting GNN" to confirm novelty
2. **Data audit**: Identify and download 5+ years of daily sea-ice data (NSIDC, AMSR2, ERA5 reanalysis)
3. **Baseline implementation**: Reproduce simple persistence and CNN baselines for 7-day forecasting
4. **Graph construction prototype**: Build grid-based and k-NN graphs for a small region (Barents Sea)

Complete these deliverables before advancing to full experimental design.
