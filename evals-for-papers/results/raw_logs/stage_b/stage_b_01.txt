**The short answer: The general approach isn't novel, but there's likely room for meaningful contributions depending on your specific angle.**

Graph neural networks have been successfully applied to weather and climate forecasting [1][2][3][4][5], showing that spatiotemporal GNNs work well for physical systems with irregular spatial structure. However, I didn't find papers specifically targeting **sea-ice forecasting** with GNNs, which suggests this particular application may be underexplored.

**Intuition**: Sea ice has natural graph structure (spatial connectivity, irregular boundaries, varying thickness) and temporal dynamics that GNNs should capture well. The question isn't whether GNNs *can* work—they likely will—but whether they offer a meaningful improvement over existing sea-ice forecasting methods, and whether you can identify *why* they work (or fail) in this domain.

**Why this is principled**: Good research problems balance tractability with impact [G12][G15]. Applying an established technique to a new domain can be valuable if (1) the domain has unique challenges that reveal something new about the method, or (2) you significantly outperform existing baselines and understand why. Simply showing "GNNs work on sea ice too" is incremental unless you dig deeper.

## Strategic Questions

Before diving in, I need to understand your angle better:

1. **What specific sea-ice forecasting problem are you targeting?** (e.g., extent prediction, thickness evolution, lead/polynya formation, seasonal vs. daily forecasts)

2. **What are the current baselines in sea-ice forecasting?** Are researchers using statistical models, physics-based simulations, or other ML approaches? What performance gaps exist?

3. **What would make this work compelling beyond "GNNs work here too"?** For example:
   - A mechanistic insight about *why* graph structure helps (or doesn't)
   - Handling irregular ice boundaries better than grid-based methods
   - Incorporating physical constraints or multi-scale dynamics
   - Significantly better performance on a key metric that matters to climate scientists

4. **What data and compute do you have access to?** Sea-ice datasets, resolution, temporal coverage, and whether you can run experiments within ~2-3 weeks to get initial signal.

## Recommendations

**Immediate next steps (1-3 days):**

1. **Literature review of sea-ice forecasting methods** (not just GNNs): Identify the current state-of-the-art, key benchmarks, and what climate scientists actually care about. Look for recent papers in domain venues (e.g., *The Cryosphere*, *Journal of Climate*).

2. **Study the weather GNN papers closely**: "Forecasting Global Weather with Graph Neural Networks" [1] and "HiSTGNN" [4] show how to structure spatiotemporal graphs for physical systems. Note their design choices (edge construction, message passing, temporal encoding).

3. **Identify a concrete differentiator**: Based on #1 and #2, articulate what your contribution would be beyond application. Examples:
   - "Existing methods use CNNs on regular grids, but sea ice has irregular boundaries that GNNs can handle natively"
   - "Current forecasts struggle with multi-scale dynamics (local leads vs. basin-wide extent); hierarchical GNNs could help"
   - "Physics-based models are slow; we can match accuracy 100× faster for operational forecasting"

**Problem selection rubric** (score 0-3 each, aim for ≥10/15):
- **Importance**: How much does better sea-ice forecasting matter? (Climate modeling, shipping routes, ecosystem impacts)
- **Tractability**: Can you get meaningful signal in 3 weeks with your resources?
- **Surprise**: Would results overturn a belief or reveal something unexpected?
- **Generality**: Do insights transfer to other cryosphere or climate problems?
- **Mechanistic payoff**: Can you explain *why* GNNs help (or don't)?

## Three Concrete Experiments

If you proceed, here are starter experiments:

**Experiment 1: Baseline Comparison on Sea-Ice Extent Forecasting**  
*Objective*: Establish whether GNNs outperform existing methods on a standard benchmark. Hypothesis: Spatiotemporal GNNs will match or exceed CNN/LSTM baselines due to better handling of irregular ice boundaries.  
*Setup*: Use publicly available sea-ice concentration data (e.g., NSIDC) for Arctic/Antarctic. Implement a simple spatiotemporal GNN (adapt HiSTGNN architecture [4]) and compare against a CNN-LSTM baseline and a persistence model. Forecast sea-ice extent 1-7 days ahead.  
*Metrics*: Mean absolute error (MAE) on ice extent, spatial correlation, and ice edge location error (km). Success = GNN reduces MAE by ≥10% vs. CNN-LSTM.  
*Interpretation*: If GNNs win, analyze *where* they improve (boundaries? rapid changes?). If they don't, investigate whether graph construction or temporal modeling is the bottleneck. Follow-up: Ablate edge types (spatial proximity vs. ocean currents) to see what connectivity matters.

**Experiment 2: Irregular Boundary Handling**  
*Objective*: Test whether GNNs better capture irregular ice edge dynamics than grid-based methods. Hypothesis: GNNs will show larger improvements in regions with complex, fractal-like ice boundaries (e.g., marginal ice zones).  
*Setup*: Focus evaluation on marginal ice zones where boundaries are most irregular. Compare GNN vs. CNN performance specifically in these regions vs. interior pack ice.  
*Metrics*: Ice edge error (distance between predicted and actual edge), stratified by region complexity (measured by boundary fractal dimension or edge length).  
*Interpretation*: If GNNs show disproportionate gains in complex regions, this supports the "irregular geometry" hypothesis and provides a mechanistic story. If not, the graph structure may not be the key factor. Follow-up: Visualize attention/message-passing patterns to see if the model focuses on boundary nodes.

**Experiment 3: Multi-Scale Dynamics with Hierarchical Graphs**  
*Objective*: Investigate whether hierarchical GNNs can capture both local (leads, polynyas) and basin-scale (extent, drift) dynamics. Hypothesis: A hierarchical graph (fine-grained nodes for local features, coarse nodes for basin-scale) will outperform single-scale GNNs.  
*Setup*: Construct a two-level graph: fine nodes (~25 km resolution) and coarse nodes (~100 km). Use a hierarchical message-passing scheme (e.g., pool local features to coarse level, then broadcast back). Compare against single-scale GNN.  
*Metrics*: Separate evaluation on local features (lead formation, small-scale variability) and basin-scale features (total extent, drift patterns). Success = hierarchical model improves on both scales.  
*Interpretation*: If hierarchy helps, this suggests sea-ice forecasting benefits from multi-scale reasoning—a potential contribution. If single-scale wins, the added complexity may not be justified. Follow-up: Analyze which scale dominates forecast skill at different lead times (short-term = local, long-term = basin-scale?).
