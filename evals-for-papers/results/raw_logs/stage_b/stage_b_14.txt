Stage: A – Pre-idea (scoping and novelty assessment)

Short answer: It’s not crowded in the protein design community, but it’s not “blank slate” either. There are several proof-of-concept hybrid quantum–classical efforts (annealing and gate-based) mostly on toy or reduced problems (lattice models, short peptides), while state-of-the-art practical design remains dominated by classical ML and physics-based tools (e.g., RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN). A “fresh” contribution is feasible if you (a) target a sharply defined subproblem where quantum subroutines plausibly help, and (b) benchmark rigorously against strong classical baselines.

Strategic questions
- Scope: Which subtask are you targeting—sequence design on fixed backbones, rotamer packing, loop/insert design, or binder/peptide design? What scale (length, rotamer library, constraints)?
- Resource reality: Do you have access to specific hardware (D-Wave annealer, IonQ/Quantinuum gate devices) or only simulators? What is your weekly compute/time budget?
- Contribution type: Are you aiming for improved objective quality, better sample efficiency at fixed time/energy budget, or provable scaling on specific combinatorial substructures?
- Benchmarking: Which classical baselines will you commit to (RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, Rosetta packer/minimization), and what success criteria (energy, structure fidelity, binder enrichment) will decide the win?

Recommendations
- Define a narrow “quantum-helps-here” slot. Examples: QUBO-based rotamer packing for a fixed backbone window; k-mer peptide binder design under hard constraints; or sequence design on lattice/coarse-grained models where the landscape is rugged.
- Pre-register head-to-head comparisons versus strong classical solvers and modern generative design, with matched time/compute budgets and clear falsifiers.
- Start on reduced systems (short peptides or lattice backbones), then show transfer to one real protein task with AlphaFold(-Multimer) validation and Rosetta scoring.

Three falsifiable experiments (compact, actionable)
1) Rotamer packing via annealing vs classical packers
- Hypothesis: Quantum annealing (QA) finds lower or equal Rosetta energy packings with fewer restarts for tightly constrained side-chain packing on fixed backbones.
- Setup: Encode rotamer packing for 8–20 residues around an active site as a QUBO; solve via D-Wave (or QA simulator) and via classical Tabu/ILP; finalize with Rosetta minimization. Datasets: 10 PDB backbones with buried pockets. Metrics: post-minimization total energy, clash count, wall-clock, solution diversity.
- Success criteria: ≥10% energy improvement at equal wall-time or same energy with ≥2× fewer restarts; otherwise hypothesis falsified.
- Interpretation: Gains suggest QA is useful for combinatorial substructures; null result indicates classical methods saturate this regime. Follow-ups: scale rotamer library size; ablate constraint strength; test noisy vs cleaned QUBOs.

2) Peptide binder design with QAOA proposals in a hybrid loop
- Hypothesis: A QAOA-based mutational proposal generator increases hit rate (predicted binding and structural plausibility) per unit compute over classical local search.
- Setup: Fixed epitope on a target; search 12–20mer peptides. Quantum step proposes top-N sequences under hard constraints (charge, motifs); classical step scores with Rosetta interface ΔΔG and filters by AlphaFold-Multimer pTM/interface pLDDT. Baselines: greedy/local search and ProteinMPNN constrained design. Metrics: fraction of sequences with ΔΔG < threshold, AF-M pLDDT > threshold, novelty vs training.
- Success criteria: ≥1.5× enrichment of “high-confidence binders” at matched compute. Falsifier: no enrichment or worse diversity.
- Interpretation: If positive, the quantum subroutine is a better proposal distribution; if negative, focus on objective/QAOA depth or constraints. Variations: change ansatz depth, noise models, tighter biophysical constraints.

3) Lattice/coarse-grained sequence design stress test
- Hypothesis: On rugged landscapes (lattice or coarse-grained contact potentials), QA/QAOA achieve better best-of-k energies and equal/better sample efficiency than simulated annealing or ILP at small-to-moderate sizes.
- Setup: HP lattice proteins (lengths 27–64) or Miyazawa–Jernigan contact models. Compare QA/QAOA vs simulated annealing/ILP under fixed wall-time. Metrics: best energy reached, success rate to within ε of known optima, time-to-ε, solution diversity.
- Success criteria: Statistically significant improvement in best energy or time-to-ε for at least one size regime; otherwise hypothesis falsified.
- Interpretation: Positive results motivate embedding these subroutines in real-backbone tasks; null results argue for classical dominance or the need for better embeddings/penalties. Follow-ups: embedding quality analysis, qubit budget vs problem size, robustness to noise.

Phase 0 (≤14 days) and gates
- Deliverables: (1) One reproduced figure/metric from a quantum-protein design paper or Rosetta packer baseline with a prediction log (≥14 entries). (2) An experiment card for Experiment 1 plus one ablation or negative result with a short post-mortem.
- If both gates pass, scale Experiment 1 to a real-backbone pocket and register target venue/timeline.

Intuition
- Quantum subroutines are most promising where the search is combinatorial, discrete, and strongly constrained; hybrid loops can let quantum propose or pack while classical tools evaluate and relax. If you benchmark on tasks where classical methods already saturate, you’re unlikely to see gains.

Why this is principled
- Best practice is to frame a crisp subproblem with a plausible advantage (mapping to QUBO/Ising or shallow circuits), compare against strong classical baselines under equal budgets, and declare clear falsifiers. Prior quantum–protein work shows feasibility on lattice/peptide scales but limited evidence of end-to-end superiority at practical sizes, so tight, head-to-head experiments are the right bar [1]. Modern classical design tools set a high baseline you must beat or complement [2].

Next actions (2–3 hours each)
- Pick one subtask (rotamer packing or peptide design) and draft the experiment card (hypothesis, falsifier, minimal test, metrics).
- Stand up the classical baseline: Rosetta packer/minimization or constrained ProteinMPNN on a small test set.
- Implement a minimal QUBO and solve on a simulator or annealer for 1–2 instances to sanity-check encoding and constraints.
