Short answer: It’s active but not crowded. Hybrid quantum–classical work exists for specific subproblems (toy-model folding/design on annealers, QAOA-based docking, and hybrid QML for binding affinity), but convincing, end-to-end protein design pipelines with clear advantages over strong classical baselines are still rare. Most published studies are feasibility-scale, use simplified physics or small datasets, and emphasize methodology over demonstrated superiority, largely due to NISQ hardware limits [1][2][4][5]. That leaves room for a “fresh” contribution if you (a) target a precise subtask where a quantum subroutine is well-justified, (b) benchmark rigorously against optimized classical solvers, and (c) quantify benefits beyond hype (solution quality, time-to-solution at fixed accuracy, sample efficiency, or energy) [1][7][8].

Where the field stands
- Folding/design on lattice/HP models via quantum annealing: demonstrated feasibility but small sizes and simplified energy functions; useful as a methodology bedrock rather than competitive end-use [2][3].  
- Docking as a combinatorial optimization (e.g., MWIS) solved with QAOA: proof-of-concept on small ligand–protein graphs; comparisons to classical heuristics are limited and do not show clear scaling wins yet [4].  
- Hybrid QML for binding affinity: some studies show parity or modest gains on narrow tasks; results are sensitive to feature engineering and kernels, with limited evidence of robust, scalable advantage over strong classical baselines [5][8].  
- Reviews emphasize opportunity in careful hybridization and benchmarking, noting hardware/noise constraints and the need for principled comparisons [1][7].

What would count as “fresh”
- A hybrid design pipeline that integrates a quantum subroutine where the structure of the subproblem matches quantum strengths (e.g., discrete side‑chain packing, constrained sequence design under pairwise energies, or docking pose selection), and that demonstrates a clear, measurable advantage vs tuned classical solvers on realistic benchmarks—not just toy models [1][4][7].  
- Methodological clarity: full problem mapping (e.g., QUBO/Ising), details of reductions/penalties, hardware/runtime accounting, and ablations that isolate the quantum contribution [1][7].  
- Using realistic energy models and community datasets (e.g., Rosetta fixed‑backbone packs, PDBbind subsets for docking) rather than only HP lattices, to improve credibility and transferability [1][2].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Docking via QAOA vs classical MWIS/ILP  
- Hypothesis: For small-to-moderate interaction graphs (<100 nodes), a QAOA-based solver matches or exceeds classical MWIS heuristics at equal wall-clock budgets, improving top-1 pose selection accuracy.  
- Setup: Build incompatibility graphs from a curated PDBbind subset; compare QAOA (p=1–3) to simulated annealing, ILP, and state-of-the-art docking heuristics.  
- Metrics: Top-1 RMSD ≤2 Å success rate; mean docking score; time-to-solution at target RMSD; energy optimality gap.  
- Controls/Ablations: Graph construction variants; mixer/ansatz choices; noise mitigation on/off; classical solver tuning parity. Expected outcome: Parity or slight wins on certain sparse graphs, with clear noise/runtime trade-offs [4][5].

2) Side-chain packing as QUBO on gate-based or annealing hardware  
- Hypothesis: A hybrid approach (classical pruning + quantum QUBO optimization) reduces energy gaps vs Rosetta’s packer on difficult fixed-backbone cases with dense pairwise couplings.  
- Setup: Standard Rosetta fixed-backbone benchmarks; stage 1: classical dead-end elimination/repacking; stage 2: quantum solve reduced QUBO; baseline: full classical packer and ILP.  
- Metrics: Rosetta energy difference, rotamer recovery rate, runtime and hardware usage.  
- Ablations: Reduction depth; penalty weights; qubit count; classical-only variants. Expected outcome: Comparable energies on small instances; characterization of when quantum helps (e.g., dense conflict graphs) [1][2].

3) Sequence design with quantum-assisted discrete optimization  
- Hypothesis: On constrained sequence design (fixed backbone with pairwise potentials), a quantum subroutine improves best-of-N solution quality at fixed compute over classical simulated annealing.  
- Setup: Use a small fixed-backbone design set; energy = pairwise statistical potential or Rosetta two-body term; search with (a) classical SA/ILP, (b) hybrid: classical proposal + quantum refinement.  
- Metrics: Native sequence recovery, predicted ΔΔG (e.g., Rosetta or ML surrogate), foldability proxy (e.g., structure predictor confidence), and compute budget.  
- Ablations: Remove quantum step; vary energy models; device noise vs ideal simulation. Expected outcome: Feasibility mapping and conditions where quantum refinement yields better low-energy sequences than classical-only search [1][7][8].

Positioning tips
- Anchor the quantum role to a clear combinatorial subproblem with a reproducible mapping (Ising/QUBO), and publish full problem formulations.  
- Use realistic baselines (ILP, message-passing/graph solvers, Rosetta variants) and report hardware—including queue times, shots, error rates—so any apparent advantage is credible [1][7].  
- Prefer modest claims; if benefits are niche (e.g., certain graph sparsities), say so and characterize the regime [1][4][7].  
- Release code, problem instances, and graph generators to enable re-use and stress-testing by others.

Bottom line: A hybrid quantum–classical pipeline for protein design can be a fresh and valuable contribution if you pick a sharply-defined subtask, engage strong classical baselines, and deliver rigorous, transparent evidence. The space is active but not saturated—especially for realistic energy models and end-to-end evaluation beyond toy lattices [1][2][4][5][7][8].
