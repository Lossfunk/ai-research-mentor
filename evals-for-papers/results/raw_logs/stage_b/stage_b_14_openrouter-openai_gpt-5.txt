Short answer: There’s room for a fresh contribution, but the space is not empty. Hybrid quantum–classical ideas have been demonstrated for drug discovery and for protein design subproblems (e.g., side‑chain packing, peptide design), mostly at small scales, often on simulators or annealers, and without end‑to‑end wet‑lab validation. To be novel, show a measurable advantage for a clearly scoped design subtask, against strong classical baselines, on real hardware or with a credible path to scale [1][2][3][4].

What’s been done (and where gaps remain)
- Hybrid pipelines in drug discovery: Recent case studies and reviews show quantum modules embedded in classical workflows (e.g., docking, optimization), but gains are demonstrated on small, carefully chosen problems and emphasize current NISQ limits [1].  
- Protein design with quantum components:  
  - Side‑chain optimization mapped to QUBO/Ising and tackled with quantum algorithms; recent work compares quantum approaches to classical methods, highlighting scaling/embedding constraints [2].  
  - Peptide design on quantum annealers has been prototyped, again at small sizes and with simplified energy terms [3].  
  - ML + quantum‑encoded optimization hybrids for protein design have appeared, indicating the concept is active but early [4].  
- Strong classical baselines (Rosetta DEE/A*/ILP, packer) remain hard to beat consistently in speed or quality, especially at realistic protein sizes [5].

Where novelty is still plausible
- Targeted “quantum co‑processor” for the hard discrete core: Use a quantum optimizer (QAOA/annealing) only for a bounded rotamer subgraph or multi‑constraint core inside a modern design loop (ProteinMPNN/inverse folding + Rosetta energy), and prove improved solution quality or time‑to‑high‑quality under tight wall‑clock budgets [2][4][5].  
- Multi‑objective constrained design: Show that encoding hard combinatorial constraints (e.g., interface specificity, electrostatics, sparse mutational windows) in a QUBO yields better Pareto fronts than classical heuristics at the same compute [2][4].  
- Hardware‑validated scaling: Demonstrate performance on real devices (annealer or gate‑based) with explicit embedding overheads and compare to (a) classical solvers and (b) quantum simulators to isolate genuine hardware advantages [1][2].  
- End‑to‑end biological validation: Even a small wet‑lab panel confirming stability/activity improvements over classical picks would be genuinely new in this niche [1].

Feasibility realities to plan for
- Problem sizing/embedding: Limited qubits/connectivity force small subgraphs or coarse discretization; embedding overhead can erase nominal speedups [1][2].  
- Noise/depth: Keep quantum steps shallow and use error‑mitigation; expect many runs to estimate energies.  
- Integration: Most value will come from careful hybrid orchestration (candidate pruning with ML, quantum for a tight combinatorial kernel, classical refinement).

Baselines you should beat or match
- Classical optimization: Rosetta packer (DEE/A*, simulated annealing), MILP/QUBO solvers on CPU/GPU, and “quantum‑inspired” heuristics [5].  
- Modern ML design: ProteinMPNN/ESM‑IF or similar inverse‑folding models generating candidates that are then classically packed/scored.  
- Quantum simulators: Your quantum module on a high‑quality simulator to disentangle hardware effects from algorithmic ones.

At least three concrete, falsifiable experiments
- E1. Side‑chain packing on fixed backbones (bounded core)  
  Setup: Map a 30–80‑residue core’s rotamer graph to QUBO; solve via (i) annealer or gate‑based QAOA and (ii) classical packer/MILP.  
  Metrics: Best energy (Rosetta score), sequence recovery vs native, wall‑clock including embedding, success rate across 100 backbones.  
  Falsifiable outcome: Hybrid finds equal‑or‑lower energies on ≥40% more cases at matched wall‑clock than the best classical heuristic; if not, the quantum kernel adds little value [2][5].

- E2. Hybrid loop with ML candidate generation  
  Setup: Generate N candidates with ProteinMPNN/ESM‑IF, then run a quantum optimizer on a constrained core to refine side chains; classical pipeline uses the same candidates but classical refinement.  
  Metrics: Post‑refinement energy, AlphaFold2 plDDT/RMSD consistency, diversity of high‑scoring sequences.  
  Falsifiable outcome: Hybrid improves median energy by ≥Δ (pre‑registered) and increases the fraction meeting AF2 confidence thresholds vs classical refinement alone; otherwise, stick with classical post‑processing [4][5].

- E3. Hardware vs simulator ablation  
  Setup: Run the identical quantum algorithm on (a) a simulator and (b) hardware; vary problem size and connectivity.  
  Metrics: Objective gap to best known solution, time‑to‑solution, effect of embedding overhead.  
  Falsifiable outcome: Hardware matches simulator quality within ε while preserving or improving time‑to‑solution for at least one nontrivial size class; if not, claims should be limited to “algorithmic feasibility” rather than hardware advantage [1][2].

- E4. Small wet‑lab validation (recommended)  
  Setup: Select top k designs from hybrid vs classical arms; express and measure stability/activity.  
  Metrics: Hit rate (stable/active), Tm, activity fold‑change.  
  Falsifiable outcome: Hybrid arm shows a statistically significant higher hit rate or stability; if not, constrain claims to in‑silico metrics.

Bottom line: The field is active but not crowded. A hybrid quantum–classical pipeline can be a fresh contribution if you (1) scope the quantum part to a demonstrably hard combinatorial kernel, (2) beat strong classical and ML baselines under realistic wall‑clock limits on real hardware, and (3) validate with structure proxies and, ideally, wet‑lab assays [1][2][4][5].
