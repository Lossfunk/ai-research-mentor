Based on the search results, **using graph neural networks for sea-ice forecasting is not entirely novel**—there is recent and emerging work in this area. Here's what exists:

## Existing Work

1. **Deep Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Sub-Seasonal Sea Ice** [1,2] - This appears to be a recent case study focused on Hudson Bay, specifically addressing sub-seasonal sea ice forecasting using deep GNNs.

2. **Graph neural network for colliding particles with application to sea ice modeling** [3] - This work applies GNNs to sea ice modeling, likely focusing on the physics of ice particle interactions.

3. **Related ice applications** [4,5] - GNNs have been applied to ice thickness prediction and Greenland ice sheet measurements, showing the broader adoption of graph-based methods in cryosphere research.

## Potential Novelty Angles

While the general idea exists, you might find novelty in:

- **Different spatial/temporal scales**: If existing work focuses on sub-seasonal forecasting, you could target daily, weekly, or seasonal predictions
- **Different regions**: The Hudson Bay study suggests regional focus; Arctic-wide or Antarctic applications might be underexplored
- **Novel graph constructions**: How you define nodes (grid cells, ice floes, regions) and edges (spatial proximity, physical connectivity, atmospheric coupling) could be innovative
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining GNNs with physics-informed constraints, data assimilation, or other ML architectures
- **Specific forecasting targets**: Concentration vs. extent vs. thickness vs. drift velocity

## Next Steps

1. Read the Hudson Bay paper [1,2] carefully to understand their methodology and limitations
2. Identify what aspects of sea-ice forecasting remain challenging or underserved
3. Consider what unique advantages graph structure brings to *your* specific forecasting problem
