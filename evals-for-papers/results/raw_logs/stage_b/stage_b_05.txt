Short answer: Using GANs in poetry has prior art for generation, but using GANs specifically for poetry analysis (e.g., scansion, authorship, stylistic profiling) is uncommon. Most poetry analysis work uses discriminative models (CRFs/LSTMs/transformers), not GANs. So “GANs for poetry analysis” can be original if you define a clear analysis objective where an adversarial setup adds measurable value (e.g., adversarial feature learning, domain adaptation, or data augmentation). It’s not original to “use a GAN” per se; the novelty must come from the task framing and empirical gains over strong baselines [1][5][6][7][8].

Evidence snapshot
- GANs have been applied to creative text/poetry generation, showing feasibility but also challenges with discrete tokens and training stability (e.g., SeqGAN uses policy gradients to handle non-differentiable sampling) [1][2][7].  
- Recent poetry modeling trends favor transformers/diffusion over GANs, suggesting GANs aren’t the dominant approach in this domain [4][8].  
- Poetry analysis tasks like scansion and authorship attribution typically rely on discriminative pipelines rather than GANs, indicating a gap where an adversarial approach might be novel if it yields better robustness or sample efficiency [5][6].

What could be original
- Adversarial feature learning: using a discriminator to enforce meter/style-aware representations that improve downstream analysis (e.g., scansion robustness across authors/eras).  
- Adversarial domain adaptation: making a meter classifier invariant to author or period through a gradient-reversal or GAN-like objective.  
- GAN-based data augmentation: generating class-conditional poetic lines to balance sparse authors/meters, with careful filtering and fidelity checks.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Adversarially-invariant scansion  
- Hypothesis: Adversarial domain-invariance (target: author/era) improves scansion accuracy and cross-domain generalization vs. non-adversarial baselines.  
- Setup: Train a scansion model with gradient-reversal (or GAN discriminator) to remove author/era signal from the encoder. Compare to the same encoder without adversarial loss.  
- Data: A metered poetry corpus with author/era labels and gold scansion (or heuristically aligned meter).  
- Metrics: Token-level F1 for stress/meter; cross-domain F1 on held-out authors/eras.  
- Expected outcome: Adversarial variant outperforms on cross-domain splits without hurting in-domain accuracy [5].

2) GAN-based augmentation for authorship attribution  
- Hypothesis: Class-conditional synthetic verses from a text GAN (or RL-trained generator) improve macro-F1 on imbalanced authorship attribution after quality filtering.  
- Setup: Train a conditional generator per author (or a single conditional model) using SeqGAN-style policy-gradient training to handle discreteness; filter samples by a perplexity/semantic filter; augment the minority classes; train a transformer classifier on real vs. augmented data.  
- Metrics: Macro-F1/ROC-AUC; ablate augmentation amount and filtering.  
- Expected outcome: Gains on minority authors; SeqGAN/RL approach justified by discrete-token challenges [7].

3) Meter/style critic for explainable analysis  
- Hypothesis: A discriminator trained to distinguish correct vs. perturbed meter (stress swaps, syllable insertions) can serve as a calibrated metricality score that correlates with expert judgments and improves error detection when combined with a scansion model.  
- Setup: Create minimally edited adversarial negatives from gold-metered lines; train a GAN-style discriminator as a meter critic; evaluate correlation with human ratings and its utility as a reranker for scansion outputs.  
- Metrics: Spearman/Pearson correlation with human scores; scansion accuracy before/after critic reranking; calibration (ECE).  
- Expected outcome: Improved error localization and calibrated confidence on metricality.

Positioning and baselines
- Baseline against strong discriminative models (biLSTM-CRF or transformer) for scansion/authorship; only claim novelty if adversarial components yield statistically significant improvements.  
- Acknowledge text-GAN challenges (mode collapse, training instability, discreteness); justify design choices with RL-based training (SeqGAN) and filtering strategies [7].  
- Mention that newer generative paradigms (diffusion, large transformers) are competitive; explain why a GAN-based approach is beneficial for your analysis objective (e.g., invariance, augmentation) [4][8].

One to two literature anchors
- Yu et al., SeqGAN: Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets with Policy Gradient (handles discrete text via RL) [7].  
- PoetryDiffusion (AAAI 2024): shows the current trend toward diffusion for poetry style/meter control, useful as a strong generative baseline for comparison [8].

If you share which analysis task you have in mind (meter, authorship, sentiment, stylistic profiling), I can tailor datasets, baselines, and evaluation specifics.
