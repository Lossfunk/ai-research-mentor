Short answer: Partly. Using GANs to generate poetry is not original, and text GANs are known to struggle with discrete tokens and underperform modern transformer baselines. Using GANs specifically for poetry analysis (e.g., meter detection, rhyme scheme classification, style/authorship attribution) is much less explored, but you’ll need a clear reason why adversarial learning helps over strong pretrained language models to claim novelty.

What’s known
- Text GANs: SeqGAN, MaskGAN, LeakGAN, RelGAN and follow-ups target discrete text generation via policy gradients or soft relaxations; they face high-variance training, mode collapse, and often lag behind pretrained LMs on fluency and diversity. Surveys document these limitations and the field’s shift toward likelihood-trained transformers for text tasks ([A Survey on Text Generation using GANs, 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11119)). 
- Poetry with GANs: There is prior work on “creative GANs” applied to poems/lyrics/metaphors, so “GANs for poetry generation” isn’t new ([Creative GANs for generating poems, lyrics, and metaphors, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09534)). 
- Adversarial learning for analysis: In NLP analysis tasks, adversarial objectives are commonly used for domain adaptation (e.g., Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks) rather than GAN-based text generation. For poetry analysis, the more standard and effective baselines today are fine-tuned transformers; adversarial/domain-invariant representation learning can help when you have domain shift (e.g., across eras, languages, or poetic forms).

How to make this genuinely novel
- Target a concrete analysis task with clear failure modes for standard models (e.g., cross-era authorship attribution, meter detection across languages, rhyme scheme detection under extreme class imbalance).
- Use the adversarial component to address a specific obstacle (e.g., generating hard negatives that minimally change content while disrupting meter/rhyme; or learning domain-invariant features across poetic traditions).
- Demonstrate measurable, statistically significant gains over strong transformer baselines (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa, Longformer) and over non-GAN adversarial alternatives (e.g., domain-adversarial training) on rigorous poetry datasets.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) GAN-generated hard negatives for meter/rhyme classification
- Hypothesis: Training a classifier with GAN-generated “near-miss” lines (same content, altered stress/rhyme) improves generalization on out-of-domain poetry compared to standard augmentation.
- Variables: Augmentation method (none vs. LM paraphrases vs. GAN-generated near-misses); classifier architecture (BiLSTM+CRF vs. transformer).
- Metrics: F1 for meter/rhyme labels; out-of-domain F1 (train on one era/author, test on another).
- Expected outcome: GAN-hard-negative augmentation yields a statistically significant F1 improvement over no augmentation and LM-only augmentation.

2) Domain-adversarial representation learning vs. GAN data augmentation for cross-era authorship attribution
- Hypothesis: Domain-adversarial training (to remove era/style covariates) beats GAN-based synthetic data augmentation for cross-era authorship attribution.
- Variables: Training regime (baseline fine-tuned transformer; +DANN head; +GAN synthetic samples).
- Metrics: Macro-F1 on held-out eras/authors; calibration (ECE); significance tests across 3–5 random seeds.
- Expected outcome: DANN improves cross-domain F1 more reliably than GAN augmentation; if a tailored GAN helps, it should outperform DANN to justify novelty.

3) Discrete text GAN vs. pretrained LM for poetry-style generation as an analysis aid
- Hypothesis: A discrete text GAN (SeqGAN/RelGAN variant) cannot match a pretrained LM in generating controllable meters/rhyme schemes useful for data augmentation or interpretability probes.
- Variables: Generator type (GAN vs. GPT-style LM with control tokens/constraints); training data size; constraint strength.
- Metrics: Automatic meter/rhyme accuracy (via a scansion/rhyme detector), distinct-n, human study on poeticity, and downstream effect on a poetry classifier when used as augmentation.
- Expected outcome: Pretrained LM wins on both stylistic control and downstream utility; if the GAN closes the gap in a specific low-resource setting, that constitutes a meaningful contribution.

Recommendations and next steps
- First, specify the “analysis” task and the domain shift you want to address. If no domain shift, start with strong transformer baselines; only add adversarial components if they address a concrete failure mode.
- If you pursue adversarial learning, prefer domain-adversarial training (DANN-style) for analysis, and reserve GANs for generating targeted hard negatives with explicit constraints (meter, rhyme). 
- Pre-register metrics, baselines, and significance testing. Compare against: (a) fine-tuned transformer; (b) transformer + domain-adversarial head; (c) LM-based augmentation; (d) your GAN approach.

Key takeaways
- GANs for poetry generation: not original. 
- GANs for poetry analysis: relatively uncommon; potentially interesting if you show clear benefits over strong transformer baselines or use adversarial training to address domain shift or to generate targeted hard negatives.
- Design your contribution around a specific analysis failure mode and validate with rigorous comparisons and significance tests.
