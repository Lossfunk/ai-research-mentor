**Intuition**: GANs for poetry analysis sits in a crowded space where the core "generate poems with neural nets" idea is well-explored, but the specific angle of using the *discriminator as an analysis engine* for existing poems—rather than just the generator for creating new ones—remains under-developed and could yield novel insights into poetic quality, style, or affect.

**Why this is principled**: The most cited poetry-GAN work [P2] focuses on generation fidelity and creativity metrics; almost no one treats the discriminator as a learned feature extractor that can rank, classify, or explain real poems. Leveraging the adversarial objective to surface latent poetic dimensions gives you a falsifiable hypothesis (does the discriminator score correlate with human judgments?) and a clear contribution gap.

### Strategic questions that would change your direction
1. Are you primarily generating new poems or analyzing existing corpora? (The former is saturated; the latter is fresher.)
2. What poetic property could your discriminator predict that current NLP or LLM embeddings miss—e.g., emotional arc, metaphor density, meter adherence?
3. How will you obtain ground-truth labels for that property: expert annotation, crowdsourcing, or distant supervision from anthologies/prizes?

### Recommendations (branch on your answer to Q1)
- **If “analyze existing poems”**: Frame the project as “Adversarial Poem Representation Learning.” Freeze the trained discriminator, extract its penultimate layer, and benchmark it on downstream tasks like period classification, style clustering, or human-likeness rating versus RoBERTa or LLM baselines.
- **If “generate new poems”**: Pivot to a hybrid setup where a large pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned with a discriminator reward that explicitly encodes a poetic constraint you care about (rhyme density, semantic coherence, topic consistency). This keeps the GAN spirit but leverages modern generative priors, distinguishing you from prior LSTM-based GANs [P2].

### Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1. **Discriminator-as-poetic-scorer**  
   Hypothesis: A GAN discriminator trained to distinguish human poetry from synthetic verse will assign higher scores to canonically “great” poems (Pulitzer, Nobel winners) than to amateur verse.  
   Setup: Collect 2k human poems split “canonical” vs. “non-canonical,” train a GAN on a separate 50k poem corpus, then rank the 2k poems by discriminator score.  
   Metrics: ROC-AUC of discriminator score separating canonical vs. non-canonical; correlation with human expert ratings (Pearson r).  
   Expected: AUC ≥ 0.7 and r ≥ 0.4; failure would suggest discriminator features do not align with human aesthetic judgment.

2. **Ablating metaphor density signal**  
   Hypothesis: Supplying the generator with an additional metaphor-density conditioning vector will improve human-rated “creativity” without harming fluency.  
   Setup: Use a metaphor detection model to label training poems; train a conditional GAN (cGAN) with vs. without this vector.  
   Metrics: Human creativity score (5-point Likert, n=100 raters); BLEU vs. reference poems; perplexity.  
   Expected: Creativity ↑ ≥ 0.5 pts, BLEU change ≤ 0.02, perplexity change ≤ 5%; otherwise the conditioning adds little controllable value.

3. **Cross-language style transfer with cyclic GAN**  
   Hypothesis: A cycle-consistent GAN can rewrite an English poem into Hindi verse while preserving sentiment and overall syllabic meter.  
   Setup: Parallel corpus of 1k English-Hindi poem pairs; train CycleGAN-style encoder-decoder; evaluate with bilingual evaluators.  
   Metrics: Sentiment preservation accuracy (% same polarity), meter preservation (% lines matching target syllable count), human acceptability score.  
   Expected: ≥ 70% sentiment match, ≥ 60% meter match, acceptability ≥ 3.5/5; lower scores would indicate cycle constraint is insufficient for poetic cross-lingual transfer.

### Next actions (≤ 3 days)
1. Draft an experiment card for Experiment 1 above; include hypothesis, falsifier (AUC < 0.6), minimal test dataset, and stop rule.  
2. Download the Gutenberg Poetry Corpus + Pulitzer winners list; run a quick RoBERTa baseline on canonical vs. non-canonical discrimination to establish a reference AUC.  
3. Decide whether you have GPU budget for full GAN training or should start with a lightweight discriminator-only study (2–3 GPU days).
