Short answer: Not entirely. There is emerging but active prior work applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to sea-ice prediction, including sub-seasonal forecasting and multi-scale graph modeling. Your work can still be novel depending on the target variable(s), spatial/temporal scale, graph construction, physics constraints, and evaluation framing [1][2][4].

What’s been done already
- Sub-seasonal sea-ice forecasting in Hudson Bay with deep GNNs/spatiotemporal graph models, demonstrating skill over baselines [1][2].
- Arctic-wide prediction using multi-scale graph modeling with neural networks (graph hierarchies across spatial scales) [4].
- Related but adjacent: GNNs applied to ice/cryosphere system emulation and to particle-collision-style dynamics with sea-ice applications (not strictly forecasting) [5][3].

Where novelty is still available
- Graph construction: dynamic, physics-informed edges using ice motion (OSI-SAF drift, buoy trajectories, or CICE/ERA5-driven motion) vs static lat–lon adjacency; edge attributes carrying winds, currents, shear, and deformation diagnostics.
- Targets and horizons: joint forecasting of concentration, thickness, and drift at 1–7 day, 2–6 week, and seasonal horizons; pan-Arctic generalization vs bay-specific models.
- Physics-informed training: constraints for area/mass conservation, non-negativity, and thermodynamic bounds; penalty terms on divergence/curl implied by ice momentum balance.
- Uncertainty and reliability: calibrated probabilistic GNNs (heteroscedastic heads, deep ensembles), with rigorous reliability and sharpness evaluation.
- Data fusion: multi-modal inputs (passive microwave, SAR embeddings, reanalysis winds/thermodynamics, SST) and ablations quantifying each modality’s value.
- Integration with NWP/sea-ice models: hybrid GNN residuals correcting CICE/CMEMS forecasts; learning graph priors for data assimilation.

Three+ concrete, falsifiable experiments
- E1: Dynamic vs static graphs
  - Setup: Compare kNN/geodesic adjacency vs motion-aware graphs (edges from 24–48h drift vectors) for 1–7 day concentration forecasts over 2013–2022 Arctic AMSR2 era.
  - Metrics: RMSE, Integrated Ice Edge Error (IIEE), anomaly correlation vs persistence/climatology baselines.
  - Falsifiable criterion: Dynamic-graph model reduces IIEE by ≥10% relative to static graph on 2018–2022 OOD years; otherwise reject advantage claim.

- E2: Physics-constrained loss
  - Setup: Add area/mass-conservation penalties and non-negativity constraints to a baseline spatiotemporal GNN; evaluate thickness+concentration joint forecasts.
  - Metrics: Physical violation rate (negative concentration/thickness pixels), domain-integrated area error, skill vs unconstrained model.
  - Falsifiable criterion: Constrained model cuts violation rate by ≥50% without degrading RMSE by >2%; else claim not supported.

- E3: Multi-modal value ablation
  - Setup: Train with and without winds (ERA5), SST, and SAR-derived deformation features; pan-Arctic 2–6 week forecasts.
  - Metrics: Skill scores vs persistence and a CNN/ViT baseline; permutation importance or Shapley attributions.
  - Falsifiable criterion: Adding winds improves week-4 ACC by ≥0.05 averaged across seasons; if not, wind contribution is negligible in this setup.

- E4: Calibration of probabilistic forecasts
  - Setup: Compare deterministic GNN vs ensemble/MC-dropout variants.
  - Metrics: CRPS, Brier score, reliability diagrams, 90% interval coverage.
  - Falsifiable criterion: Probabilistic model achieves coverage 90% ± 5% with CRPS < deterministic RMSE; else calibration advantage not demonstrated.

- E5: Cross-region generalization
  - Setup: Train in Hudson Bay/Beaufort and test on Baffin/Grenville or Antarctic; same graph construction.
  - Metrics: Relative skill degradation vs in-domain; transfer vs from-scratch training.
  - Falsifiable criterion: Pretrained-to-transfer model retains ≥70% of in-domain skill; otherwise limited portability.

Practical baselines and data
- Data: NSIDC/OSI-SAF sea-ice concentration, SMOS/SMAP/CryoSat-2 thickness, OSI-SAF drift, ERA5 forcings; consistent AMSR2 period (2012–present).
- Baselines: Persistence, climatology, ConvLSTM/U-Net, Graph WaveNet/DCRNN; compare against published graph models where code/preprints exist [1][4].

Takeaway
- Using graph nets for sea-ice forecasting is no longer “new,” but the space is early and open. Novelty will hinge on physics-informed graph design, broader targets/horizons, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous, region-robust evaluations against strong baselines, all of which you can demonstrate via the experiments above [1][2][4].
