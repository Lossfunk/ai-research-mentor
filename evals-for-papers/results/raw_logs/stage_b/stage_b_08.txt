**Intuition**: The LLM-citizen science intersection for air quality sits at a sweet spot—citizen science needs scalable data validation and interpretation, while LLMs need grounded, real-world environmental context. The risk isn't technical feasibility but whether you can demonstrate clear value over existing environmental monitoring approaches.

**Why this is principled**: Environmental AI research shows that domain-specific validation is crucial [P5], and citizen science projects succeed when they provide immediate, actionable feedback to participants [P2]. Your intersection needs to solve both the data quality problem in citizen science AND the grounding problem in LLMs.

## Risk & Originality Assessment

**Originality: Moderate-High (7/10)** - While citizen science NLP exists [P2] and environmental LLM benchmarks are emerging [P5], the specific combination of LLMs for processing/analyzing citizen-collected air quality logs appears underexplored. Most existing work focuses on social media environmental data [P3] rather than sensor networks.

**Risk Profile: Medium-Low** - Technical feasibility is high given mature LLM capabilities, but you face three key risks: (1) data quality validation in citizen science contexts [P1], (2) demonstrating clear advantage over traditional air quality monitoring, and (3) achieving meaningful spatial-temporal resolution.

## Strategic Questions

1. **What's your primary value proposition**—helping citizens interpret their own data, validating crowdsourced measurements, or generating new insights from distributed sensor networks?

2. **What air quality parameters are citizens actually collecting**—PM2.5, NO2, ozone, or just visual/smell reports? This dramatically changes your technical approach.

3. **Do you have access to ground-truth reference data** to validate both the citizen measurements and your LLM interpretations?

## Three Concrete Experiments

**Experiment 1: Data Quality Validation**
Test whether LLMs can identify erroneous citizen science air quality readings by training on synthetic noise patterns. Use low-cost sensor datasets with known quality issues, create prompts that ask LLMs to flag anomalies based on meteorological context and sensor behavior patterns. Measure precision/recall against manual expert annotation, targeting ≥80% agreement with domain experts.

**Experiment 2: Contextual Interpretation**
Evaluate whether LLMs can provide meaningful health/action recommendations from citizen air quality data compared to static EPA guidelines. Collect 100 citizen sensor readings across different pollution levels, generate personalized recommendations using LLMs vs. rule-based systems. Have 20 participants rate usefulness and clarity, targeting ≥30% improvement in perceived actionability.

**Experiment 3: Spatial Interpolation**
Test if LLMs can meaningfully interpolate between sparse citizen sensor readings using contextual clues (traffic patterns, land use, weather). Create synthetic "sensor deserts" in existing dense networks, prompt LLMs to predict missing values using surrounding citizen data plus contextual information. Compare against traditional kriging methods, targeting ≤20% higher error but with interpretable reasoning.

## Next Actions (Week 1)

1. **Map your data landscape**—identify 2-3 existing citizen science air quality datasets (PurpleAir, OpenAQ, or local projects) and their data formats
2. **Define your validation baseline**—what constitutes "good" air quality interpretation that you'd beat?
3. **Draft your experiment card** focusing on Experiment 1, including your falsifiability criterion: what result would convince you this approach doesn't work?
