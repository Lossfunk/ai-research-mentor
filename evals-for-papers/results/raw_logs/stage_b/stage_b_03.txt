Short answer: The ambition is admirable, but the idea “build AGI to solve world hunger” is not novel at the level it’s phrased; there’s already a substantial literature on AI for food systems across yield prediction, post‑harvest loss, supply chains, and targeting of aid. Novelty (and publishable impact) will come from a sharply scoped, falsifiable intervention with credible pathways to measurable food security gains. [P1][P3][P6][P4][P5] Methodologically, scoping to a tractable subproblem with clear success metrics is the standard way to turn a moonshot into real progress. [G10][G9][G5]

Quick intake (so I can tailor a plan)
- What compute and data access do you have (GPUs, satellite data, supply-chain logs, survey data) and weekly time budget?
- Are you already tied to a region/crop/supply chain partner, or is this exploratory?
- Do you have a mentor/PI or collaborators in ag/food systems? Any target venue or 3–6 month milestone?
- What is your biggest bottleneck right now (data access, problem scoping, evaluation design, partnerships)?

Recommendations (Stage A → B)
- Reframe to a concrete lever: e.g., “reduce post-harvest losses in X crop by Y% via predictive routing,” or “improve smallholder yield forecasts under sparse labels.” Then define a falsifier and minimal test. [G9][G5]
- Pick one of three high‑leverage fronts with existing data: (a) yield prediction in data‑scarce settings, (b) post‑harvest loss forecasting and logistics optimization, or (c) poverty/need mapping for targeting interventions. [P6][P4][P5][P3]
- Phase 0 (≤14 days, gate to proceed):
  1) Prediction log (≥14 entries) and one reproduced metric/figure from a relevant paper with ≤10% relative gap across ≥3 seeds. [G9]
  2) One experiment card plus one ablation or negative result with a brief post‑mortem. [G6][G8]

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Data‑scarce yield forecasting with self‑supervision
- Hypothesis: Self‑supervised pretraining on unlabeled Sentinel‑2 time series will reduce MAE of yield predictions by ≥10% vs. supervised baselines in low‑label regions. [P6]
- Setup: Public satellite data (Sentinel‑2), ground truth from USDA/NASS or equivalent; compare Temporal CNN/LSTM vs. masked‑autoencoder or contrastive pretraining, then fine‑tune. Compute: 1–2 GPUs.
- Metrics: MAE/RMSE, spatial cross‑region generalization; success if ≥10% MAE reduction and calibration improves (Brier/quantile loss).
- Interpretation: Gains localized to low‑label districts support the data‑efficiency claim; no gains imply issues with pretext tasks or resolution.
- Follow‑ups: Domain adaptation across countries; multi‑task with weather and phenology. [P6]

2) Post‑harvest spoilage forecasting + routing optimization
- Hypothesis: A demand/temperature‑aware spoilage forecaster plus vehicle‑routing optimization reduces simulated waste by ≥15% relative to FIFO and standard OR heuristics. [P4][P5]
- Setup: Historical shipments, ambient/cold‑chain temperatures (open datasets or partner data); train time‑to‑spoil regression; embed into VRP with perishability penalties.
- Metrics: Waste %, on‑time delivery, cold‑storage utilization; offline counterfactual or digital‑twin evaluation.
- Interpretation: If waste drops without service penalties, the pipeline is promising; if not, the forecast may be miscalibrated or the policy overfits.
- Follow‑ups: Robust optimization under forecast uncertainty; limited‑feedback online learning. [P4][P5]

3) Targeting food aid via satellite‑based poverty/food‑insecurity mapping
- Hypothesis: Self‑supervised satellite encoders fine‑tuned on scarce household surveys improve correlation with ground‑truth poverty/food insecurity by ≥0.05–0.10 R compared with ImageNet‑pretrained CNNs. [P3]
- Setup: Nightlights + Sentinel‑2, DHS/LSMS or IPC phase labels; compare SSL (BYOL/MAE) vs. standard CNN; evaluate cross‑country transfer.
- Metrics: Pearson/Spearman R, AUROC for IPC classification, calibration plots; success if correlation and calibration improve.
- Interpretation: Improvements in transfer suggest better data efficiency; weak gains imply label noise or domain shift dominates.
- Follow‑ups: Uncertainty‑aware active sampling to guide limited surveys. [P3]

Branching by constraints
- Low compute/no partner: Start with Experiment 1 using fully public data; aim for a clean replication + one ablation.
- With NGO/industry partner: Prioritize Experiment 2; even a high‑fidelity simulation study can be publishable if backed by partner data semantics. [P5]
- Policy/impact focus: Experiment 3 can support measurable targeting improvements that translate to real aid efficiency. [P3]

Problem selection rubric (quick pass)
- Importance: 3/3; Tractability (as “AGI”): 0/3; Surprise: 1/3; Generality: 2/3; Mechanistic payoff: 1/3 → 7/15. Reframed subproblems above can reach ≥11–12/15. [G10][G9]

Next actions (2–3 days)
- Choose one experiment and draft the experiment card (hypothesis, falsifier, minimal test, variables, analysis, stop rule). [G9]
- Replicate one baseline from a recent review/survey and log predictions; target ≤10% reproduction gap. [P6]
- Send me your resource profile and chosen domain so I can tailor datasets, baselines, and a submission venue.

Intuition
- “AGI to solve hunger” is too broad to test; concrete, high‑leverage bottlenecks like yield under sparse labels, post‑harvest loss, and aid targeting admit measurable improvements with today’s tools, and progress compounds across the food system.

Why this is principled
- Hamming’s and Schulman’s advice: work on important problems but cut them into tractable, falsifiable pieces with fast feedback and clear metrics. [G10][G9] The agrifood AI literature shows repeatable progress on these subproblems and highlights gaps in data efficiency, generalization, and decision‑coupled evaluation—ripe areas for contribution.
