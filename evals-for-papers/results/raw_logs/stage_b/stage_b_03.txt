The aspiration isn’t novel—dozens of manifestos already claim AGI will “end hunger” [P1][P5]. What *is* still scarce (and therefore publishable) are falsifiable micro-hypotheses that tie a specific AGI capability to a measurable food-system outcome. Below is a rapid novelty check plus three concrete experiments that would actually advance the field.

-------------------------------------------------
Novelty scan (score ≤ 3 each dimension)
1. Importance: 3 – hunger remains a top-tier global problem.  
2. Tractability: 1 – “build AGI” is not 3-week tractable; must slice to a sub-task.  
3. Surprise: 0 – the linkage is already a cliché.  
4. Generality: 2 – if it works, many crops/regions benefit.  
5. Mechanistic payoff: 1 – no clear “why” hypothesis yet.  
Total = 7/15 → iterate or scope-down required [G4].

-------------------------------------------------
Strategic questions (answer before you code or read further)
A. Which *single* food-system bottleneck will you attack first (e.g., post-harvest loss, variety selection, supply-chain routing)?  
B. What AGI capability do you actually need that today’s narrow ML lacks—open-world planning, causal discovery, zero-shot control, or just better data fusion?  
C. How will you get ground-truth labels at scale—partner with CGIAR breeding stations, satellite start-ups, or farmer WhatsApp groups?

-------------------------------------------------
Three falsifiable experiments (≤4 weeks each, no AGI required yet)

Experiment 1 – “Zero-shot cultivar recommendation”  
Hypothesis: An LLM fine-tuned on global breeding trial reports outperforms elite crop-growth simulators on *unseen* climate-soil combinations.  
Setup: 120k trial rows from CGIAR open-access repos; embed text + tabular climate covariates; predict yield rank.  
Metrics: Kendall τ vs. DSSAT simulator; Δτ ≥ 0.15 is meaningful.  
Interpretation: If τ↑, language-based zero-shot transfer is plausible; if not, bottleneck is data not model scale.  
Follow-up: Replace LLM with retrieval-augmented narrow model to test whether memory, not reasoning, drives gain.

Experiment 2 – “Supply-chain rerouting under conflict shock”  
Hypothesis: A multi-agent RL policy (trained on historic maritime + road data) reduces calorie-loss ≥8 % when a Black-Sea-type port closure is injected at test time.  
Setup: Open UN Comtrade + AIS ship paths; build graph with port-capacity nodes; sudden node dropout.  
Metrics: % calories delivered vs. greedy baseline; run 50 seeds.  
Interpretation: Success implies AGI-level planning may help; failure pinpoints need for better real-time procurement data.  
Follow-up: Ablate communication channel between agents—if performance collapses, coordination is the key capability.

Experiment 3 – “Early famine detection from news + satellite”  
Hypothesis: A vision-language model that fuses Sentinel-2 NDVI anomalies with local news sentiment predicts IPC food-insecurity phase ≥6 weeks earlier than NDVI alone.  
Setup: 2010-2023 East-Africa data; 712 IPC labels; use F1(≥phase 3) as metric.  
Success: Δ F1 ≥ 0.10 with ≤2 % false-alarm rate.  
Interpretation: Confirms whether semantic signals add mechanistic value; if not, focus on sensor density instead of bigger models.  
Follow-up: Test generalization to Sahel region without retraining—measures robustness, an AGI prerequisite.

Next 48-hour actions
1. Pick one bottleneck (Q-A above) and fill out a one-page experiment card (hypothesis, falsifier, minimal test, variables, expected patterns, stop rule) [G11].  
2. Download the open datasets named in the experiment you chose; run a 100-row sanity check to verify label quality.  
3. Post the card here; we’ll validate design risks and controls before you burn GPU credits.
