I need to gather some essential context before we dive into novelty and feasibility. Let me ask a few quick questions to tailor my guidance:

1. **Resources & Time**: What's your weekly time budget for this project, and do you have access to significant compute (e.g., multi-GPU clusters) or are you working with limited resources (e.g., a single GPU or CPU)?

2. **Current Stage**: Are you a PhD student, independent researcher, or in industry? Do you have advisor support or collaborators for a project of this scope?

3. **Target & Timeline**: Are you aiming for a specific venue (conference/journal) or milestone? What's your timeline (e.g., 3 months, 1 year)?

4. **Biggest Bottleneck**: What's blocking you most right now—unclear problem formulation, lack of technical background, uncertainty about where to start, or something else?

**Intuition**: "AGI to solve world hunger" conflates two very different problems: (1) building artificial general intelligence (a multi-decade, multi-billion-dollar open problem), and (2) addressing world hunger (a complex socio-economic, logistical, and political challenge). Coupling them makes both the research question and the contribution unclear.

**Why this is principled**: Strong research problems are *tractable* (you can make measurable progress in weeks to months), *falsifiable* (you can test specific hypotheses), and *scoped* to a concrete contribution [G1]. Hamming's classic advice emphasizes working on important problems, but also stresses that you must work on problems where you can make progress *now* with available resources [G2]. Your framing currently lacks both a testable hypothesis and a clear path to incremental validation.

**My initial take** (before hearing your context):

- **Novelty**: The goal is too broad to assess novelty. "AGI" itself is an unsolved, multi-faceted problem with no consensus definition. "Solving world hunger" is a societal outcome, not a research contribution.
  
- **Feasibility**: Extremely low as stated. You'd need to decompose this into a specific, testable research question.

**What would make this actionable?**  
Pick *one* narrow, concrete problem at the intersection of AI and food security. For example:
- **Crop yield prediction** using satellite imagery and weather data
- **Supply chain optimization** for food distribution in resource-constrained regions
- **Nutritional recommendation systems** for low-income populations
- **Early warning systems** for famine or food crises using multimodal data

Each of these is a well-defined ML problem with existing benchmarks, baselines, and real-world impact potential.

**Next Steps** (once you answer the intake questions):
1. **Clarify your actual research interest**: Are you passionate about AGI capabilities, or about applying AI to food security? These lead to very different projects.
2. **Scope to a 3-month pilot**: What's one experiment you could run in the next few weeks to test a specific hypothesis?
3. **Identify a concrete metric**: What would success look like in a first paper or project milestone?

Please share your answers to the four questions above, and I'll help you refine this into a tractable, novel research direction.
