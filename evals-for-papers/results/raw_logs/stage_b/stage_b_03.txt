Short answer: As a research idea, “build AGI to solve world hunger” is not novel; it’s a broad, longstanding aspiration discussed by policymakers and researchers who emphasize targeted, responsibly-governed AI for food systems rather than AGI per se [P3][P4]. Even pro-AGI perspectives frame applications in agriculture as future and speculative; the actionable progress today comes from scoped AI systems for yield forecasting, targeting, logistics, and governance, not from generalized intelligence [P7]. Moreover, persistent drivers of hunger (poverty, conflict, climate shocks, policy) mean AI must be embedded in institutions and interventions; technology alone is insufficient [P4][P8]. If you want a novel, publishable contribution, you should narrow to a testable subproblem with clear data, baselines, and decision impact.

How to scope this into a testable contribution
- Pick a decision bottleneck: e.g., early warning of acute food insecurity; targeting of cash/food assistance; last‑mile routing for perishables; smallholder advisory under input constraints [P3][P5].
- Tie model outputs to actions and outcomes: optimize for metrics decision-makers care about (food insecurity prevalence, timeliness of delivery, spoilage, equity across groups), not just prediction accuracy [P3][P8].
- Use strong baselines and external validity checks: compare against operational heuristics and classical ML; test generalization across regions/seasons; audit fairness and robustness [P3][P8].
- Engage data realities: remote sensing + weather + market prices + mobile/administrative data; expect missingness, domain shift, and governance constraints [P3][P5].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Causal targeting of food assistance using multimodal features
- Hypothesis: A causal uplift model using satellite, weather, and market price features can improve identification of households at risk of acute food insecurity versus current heuristic targeting. Grounding reflects operational interest in responsibly applying AI to real problems (e.g., WFP innovation initiatives) [P1]. 
- Setup: Train an uplift model (e.g., T-learner/meta-learner) on historical assistance rollout and outcomes; use satellite NDVI, rainfall, market prices, and prior vulnerability indicators as covariates. Compare against (a) geographical targeting and (b) standard risk scoring without causal framing.
- Metrics: Policy value via offline evaluation (inverse propensity scoring), calibrated risk coverage, subgroup equity gaps, and counterfactual uplift AUC. 
- Expected outcome: Under overlap and ignorability checks, uplift models increase expected beneficiaries reached per unit budget by ≥X% while maintaining or reducing subgroup disparities [P3][P8].

2) Foundation model vs. classical baselines for out‑of‑domain yield nowcasting
- Hypothesis: A lightweight foundation model fine‑tuned on low- and middle-income country (LMIC) labels will generalize better across crops/ecoregions than random forest or LSTM baselines trained per-region, reflecting the cross‑region generalization challenges highlighted for AI in agriculture [P3][P5].
- Setup: Pretrain a vision–temporal encoder on global satellite time series; fine‑tune on country-labeled yield or vegetation proxies. Train baselines (RF, temporal CNN/LSTM) with identical features. Hold out regions and seasons to test domain shift.
- Metrics: RMSE/MAE, skill over climatology, reliability of predictive intervals, and worst‑group performance across agroecological zones.
- Expected outcome: The fine‑tuned model improves worst‑group error and provides better-calibrated uncertainty, a requirement for responsible operational use [P3][P5].

3) Robust last‑mile routing under supply and access disruptions
- Hypothesis: Integrating short‑horizon demand forecasts into a robust vehicle routing model reduces delivery delays and spoilage relative to static planning, aligning with calls to pair AI predictions with logistics and governance for impact [P4][P5].
- Setup: Forecast micro‑area demand using recent deliveries, market prices, and weather; feed to a distributionally robust VRP with time windows and cold‑chain constraints. Compare to (a) historical static routes and (b) deterministic VRP using point forecasts.
- Metrics: Mean delivery time, spoilage rate, service level under simulated shocks (road closures, supply shortfalls).
- Expected outcome: Robust routing yields statistically significant reductions in delays and spoilage across stress tests [P4][P5].

Optional ethics and governance evaluation (recommended)
4) Bias, transparency, and governance audit of an operational food-security model
- Hypothesis: Without explicit governance controls, models will exhibit systematic performance disparities across smallholder types and regions; structured audits help mitigate harms [P8].
- Setup: Evaluate subgroup errors and calibration across landholding size, gender of household head, and market access; add fairness constraints or reweighting; assess transparency and data governance.
- Metrics: Between-group error gaps, calibration, and impact parity; documentation scorecards.
- Expected outcome: Audited models reduce disparities without large overall accuracy loss [P8].

Is there any path to novelty around “AGI” here?
- Yes, but it requires specificity. For instance: task‑oriented, tool‑augmented agents that plan multi‑step interventions across data modalities and constraints; or agents that learn to coordinate forecasts, procurement, and routing with human oversight. Even then, “AGI” claims should be avoided unless you demonstrate cross‑domain generality beyond agriculture; focus on decision efficacy, safety, and governance in food systems [P7][P8]. 

Two practical next steps
- Choose one bottleneck and assemble a minimal, policy-relevant dataset and baseline; define action-linked metrics before modeling [P3][P5].
- Co-design with an implementing partner (e.g., extension service, NGO) to ensure feasibility, data access, and evaluation in realistic settings [P1][P4].
