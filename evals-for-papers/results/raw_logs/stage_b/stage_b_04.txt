Short answer: Yes—if you scope it tightly and build up from a simple baseline. You don’t need to start with a complex graph model on day one.

Minimal viable path for a true beginner
- Define a small, concrete task: 1-day-ahead prediction of sea-ice concentration (SIC) or binary “ice edge” (e.g., SIC ≥ 15%) for a small Arctic patch (e.g., 128×128) using daily gridded data.
- Start with a simple baseline before any graph model:
  - Data: Use the IceNet resources (preprocessed SIC and predictors are available) to avoid heavy preprocessing.
  - Model: A small 2D CNN or U-Net that takes the last 7 days of SIC as input and predicts day t+1.
  - Metrics: RMSE for SIC, Brier score for probabilistic ice-edge, and lead-time skill curves (day 1–7).
- Add a minimal graph layer:
  - Treat the grid as a graph (each cell is a node; 4-neighbor or 8-neighbor adjacency). Use PyTorch Geometric for 1–2 message-passing layers on top of CNN features.
  - Keep batch sizes and region size small; use Colab/1 modest GPU.
- Only then scale scope: larger region, longer horizons (3–7 days), or more inputs (winds, SST).
- Why this order: Deep-learning baselines already work well for sea-ice (IceNet), and graph message passing is proven for geophysical grids (GraphCast). Add physics constraints and uncertainty as incremental layers once a baseline is stable [P2], [P4].

Feasibility and effort estimate for a non-coder
- Learning curve: 1–2 weeks to get comfortable with Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and Colab notebooks.
- Baseline replication: 2–4 weeks to train a small CNN nowcaster on a small patch and compute basic metrics.
- First GNN: 2–3 additional weeks to add a graph layer (GCN/GraphSAGE) and run ablations.
- Total: ~5–9 weeks part-time for a working minimal demonstration. This is realistic if you keep the task/region small and reuse existing data pipelines.

What to use (beginner-friendly)
- Data and baselines: IceNet code/data artifacts and tutorials lower the barrier substantially (see links in Citations).
- Frameworks:
  - PyTorch + PyTorch Geometric (for GNN layers).
  - Start in Google Colab; upgrade to Colab Pro if you hit memory/time limits.
- Model recipe:
  - Inputs: last 7 daily SIC maps (optionally simple winds).
  - Baseline: small U-Net or CNN.
  - GNN: build a graph from the 2D grid; 1–2 message-passing layers to refine the CNN features.
  - Loss: MSE for SIC; or BCE/Brier for probabilistic ice-edge.
  - Evaluation: RMSE/MAE, Brier, reliability curves; ice-edge distance error for edge-focused tasks.

Key risks and how to reduce them
- Data wrangling complexity: Use IceNet-processed data to avoid starting from raw satellite products.
- Data leakage: Strictly split by time (train/val/test by contiguous blocks); never shuffle across time.
- Overfitting on small patches: Use early stopping and simple models first; add capacity gradually.
- Unstable multi-step forecasts: Prefer direct multi-horizon training or physics-regularized losses; physics constraints can stabilize forecasts in partially observed systems [P2].
- Uncertainty and decision-making: Use ensembles or Bayesian approximations to quantify predictive uncertainty; this is standard in geophysical modeling and improves risk-aware decisions [P4].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Baseline CNN vs. Graph-augmented model for 1-day SIC nowcast
- Hypothesis: A light GNN on the grid graph improves RMSE and Brier score over a CNN baseline by better capturing lateral transport and neighborhood coupling.
- Setup: Same inputs/outputs, same training data, same parameter budget; graph edges = 4-neighbor adjacency. Train both for identical epochs.
- Metrics: RMSE (SIC), Brier score (ice edge), reliability (ECE), inference time.
- Expected outcome: Small but measurable improvement in RMSE/Brier with GNN; if not, the graph layer may be unnecessary for 1-day horizons.

2) Edge topology ablation (physics-informed vs. geometric graph)
- Hypothesis: Using motion-informed edges (build edges from estimated sea-ice drift vectors) outperforms simple 4-neighbor graphs.
- Setup: Compare three graphs: 4-neighbor, 8-neighbor, and k-NN along recent motion vectors (derived from optical flow or drift fields). Same model otherwise.
- Metrics: Lead-time skill at 1–3 days, ice-edge distance error, RMSE.
- Expected outcome: Motion-informed edges yield better multi-day skill, especially near dynamic margins.

3) Uncertainty quantification and calibration
- Hypothesis: Deep ensembles or MC dropout yield better-calibrated probabilistic ice-edge forecasts than a single deterministic model.
- Setup: Train 5-seed ensemble of the best model from (1) vs. single model with temperature scaling; optionally Monte Carlo dropout at inference.
- Metrics: Brier, CRPS, reliability diagrams, sharpness vs. calibration trade-offs.
- Expected outcome: Ensembles improve calibration and probabilistic skill, consistent with geophysical modeling practice [P4].

Optional extensions once (1)–(3) work
- Physics constraints: Add bounded outputs and basic conservation/penalty terms to improve stability for multi-step forecasts [P2].
- Longer horizons: Train direct 3- and 7-day models and compare to iterative one-step models (teacher forcing vs. free running).

Practical next steps this week
- Day 1–2: Set up Colab, learn PyTorch tensor ops and a minimal CNN on MNIST.
- Day 3–5: Download a small IceNet sample region; train a 2D CNN for 1-day SIC nowcast; compute RMSE and Brier.
- Day 6–10: Wrap the grid as a graph (4-neighbors) and add a single GCN layer via PyTorch Geometric; re-run metrics and log results.
- Day 11–14: Run experiment (2) with different graph topologies; keep careful logs and plots.

Literature anchors to guide design
- IceNet shows that deep learning can forecast sea ice probabilistically with skill using gridded inputs; you can reuse their data and setup as a starting point (Nature Communications 2021; see resources below).
- GraphCast demonstrates that message passing on geophysical grids scales and is competitive for weather forecasting, which is conceptually similar to sea-ice dynamics at shorter horizons.

Key takeaways
- Feasible for a beginner if you start with a tiny, well-scoped forecasting task and a simple CNN, then add one graph layer.
- Reuse IceNet assets and Colab to minimize infrastructure overhead.
- Focus on clean evaluation and three targeted experiments; only scale complexity after you’ve established a strong, reproducible baseline.
