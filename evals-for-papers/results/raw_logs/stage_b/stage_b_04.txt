Short answer: Yes—if you scope carefully and lean on existing notebooks and code templates, a first GNN-for–sea-ice project is feasible for a beginner in about 6–10 weeks. Start with a simple baseline on a gridded task, then add a minimal graph layer where it clearly helps (irregular meshes or interacting floes). Prior work shows GNNs are useful on irregular ice/mesh domains and for interaction-style phenomena, but you don’t need to code everything from scratch to try this [P2][P1].

Practical plan for a true beginner
- Weeks 1–2: Python + Jupyter + Colab basics; NumPy/Pandas; plotting. Aim to run someone else’s notebook end-to-end (no edits yet).
- Weeks 3–4: PyTorch basics; learn to load a small sea-ice dataset and train a tiny CNN baseline on a toy task. Use Colab to avoid local setup.
- Weeks 5–6: Add a simple, interpretable baseline (persistence, linear regression, or small U-Net). Establish metrics and a fixed train/val/test split.
- Weeks 7–8: Introduce a minimal GNN using PyTorch Geometric on a grid-as-graph (4- or 8-neighbor) to replace or augment the CNN head.
- Weeks 9–10: One ablation study, one error analysis plot, and a short write-up with exact data versions, seeds, and code links.

When a GNN is worth it
- Irregular meshes or unstructured grids (e.g., ISSM/neXtSIM) where CNNs struggle: a GCN can exploit mesh connectivity and has been used as a fast emulator for ice models [P2].
- Interacting-floe or collision-style dynamics where relationships between entities matter: graph edges can encode pairwise interactions [P1].
- If your data are regular gridded rasters and locality is simple, start with CNNs/U-Nets; only add graph layers if they reduce error or improve stability on edge cases [P2].

Starter tasks and datasets
- Gridded nowcasting/forecasting: sea-ice concentration maps (e.g., OSI-SAF) for 1–3 day prediction. Good for baselines; turn the grid into a simple 8-neighbor graph later [P10].
- Drift prediction: predict next-step motion vectors from recent frames; consider superpixels or floe segments as nodes if you attempt a graph of moving parts [P1].
- Emulator on meshes: if you have neXtSIM/ISSM outputs on an unstructured mesh, compare an MLP to a small GCN on the mesh graph [P2].
- Low-code data handling: the ICESat‑2 hackweek notebooks show how to turn polar datasets into ML-ready arrays—use as a pattern even if you don’t use ICESat‑2 right away [P6].

Reproducibility basics
- Fix seeds; pin package versions; save the exact data query (date range, region); log metrics and configs per run. Keep a tiny 1% “dev” subset to iterate quickly.
- Report RMSE/MAE for continuous targets; ACC/F1 for discrete events; CRPS if you try probabilistic outputs [P10].

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Sea-ice concentration nowcasting on a grid
- Hypothesis: A simple GNN on an 8-neighbor grid matches or slightly improves 1–3 day SIC RMSE over a small CNN/U‑Net by leveraging explicit neighborhood aggregation [P10].
- Data: Daily SIC tiles over a fixed Arctic subset (e.g., 2018–2022 train, 2023 val, 2024 test).
- Models: Persistence; small 3D CNN/U‑Net; GCN head over grid graph (same receptive field).
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE; ACC/F1 for ice/no-ice thresholding [P10].
- Ablations: 4- vs 8-neighbor graphs; remove temporal edges; edge weighting by distance vs unweighted.
- Expected outcome: On regular grids, improvements (if any) will be modest; this establishes a fair baseline to justify graph complexity.

2) Drift vector prediction with interaction edges
- Hypothesis: A graph model where nodes are segmented floes and edges connect nearby floes reduces endpoint error vs. per-pixel CNN by modeling local interactions [P1].
- Data: Paired drift fields; node features from floe segments (area, average velocity, concentration).
- Models: Optical-flow baseline or CNN regressor; message-passing GNN over floe graph.
- Metrics: Endpoint error (km), angular error; robustness on high-wind events.
- Ablations: Edge radius (50/100/200 km), learned vs fixed edge weights; remove interaction edges.
- Expected outcome: GNN helps most during strong deformation/lead formation periods (conjecture to be tested), not necessarily in calm regimes [P1].

3) Mesh-based emulator for model outputs (thickness or velocity)
- Hypothesis: On an unstructured mesh, a GCN reduces RMSE vs. node-wise MLP by leveraging mesh connectivity, replicating findings in ice/mesh emulation [P2].
- Data: A small subset of neXtSIM/ISSM outputs on a fixed mesh; train on multiple forcing snapshots, test on held-out times.
- Models: Per-node MLP; 2–3 layer GCN; optionally a CNN baseline on rasterized fields (control).
- Metrics: RMSE/MAE; spatial correlation; compute time vs. reference model.
- Ablations: Remove edges (becomes MLP); vary message-passing layers; try residual connections.
- Expected outcome: GCN outperforms MLP on meshes and can be competitive with raster CNNs while preserving mesh fidelity [P2].

Risk reduction and scope control
- Start with a 64×64 tile and 2–4 weeks of data to ensure your pipeline runs in minutes.
- Only introduce one new complexity at a time (new metric, new edge type, then new model).
- Stop if the GNN does not beat the tuned baseline on validation after 2–3 ablations; document and pivot.

Low-code tips
- Use Colab + PyTorch Geometric example notebooks to avoid local CUDA setup.
- Clone an existing sea-ice ML notebook (e.g., from hackweeks) and swap in your dataset slice before altering models [P6].

Bottom line
- Feasible if you treat “GNNs for sea ice” as a staged progression: baseline first, then the simplest graph where it clearly adds value (irregular meshes or interacting floes). Prior work supports both mesh emulators and interaction-style models in cryosphere settings, which you can emulate with minimal custom code to start [P2][P1].
