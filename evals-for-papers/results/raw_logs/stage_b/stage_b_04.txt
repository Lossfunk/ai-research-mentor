I need to understand your situation better before I can give you solid advice. Let me gather some context and then provide initial guidance.

## Quick Context Check

To tailor my advice properly, I need to know:

1. **Compute & time**: Do you have access to GPUs (through a university, Colab, etc.)? How many hours per week can you dedicate to this?

2. **Background**: What's your experience level? (e.g., undergrad/grad student in climate science, self-learner, career switcher?) Have you done any programming before, even if not ML?

3. **Support**: Are you working with an advisor or collaborators who code? Or would this be solo?

4. **Goal**: What's driving this—a thesis project, exploratory research, coursework? Any timeline or venue in mind?

5. **Biggest bottleneck**: Is it the coding barrier, understanding graph nets conceptually, accessing sea ice data, or something else?

## Initial Take (before I know your specifics)

**Intuition**: Graph neural networks for sea ice modeling is scientifically compelling—sea ice has natural spatial structure (adjacency, flow patterns) that graphs can capture—but the "never coded" part creates a steep double learning curve: you'd be learning programming fundamentals *and* deep learning *and* domain-specific data handling simultaneously.

**Why this is principled**: Research mentorship guidelines emphasize starting with problems where you can get signal quickly (ideally within 2–3 weeks). Coding from scratch while learning GNNs risks spending months on tooling before you can test a single hypothesis. Feasibility hinges on whether you can leverage existing code, get hands-on help, or accept a longer ramp-up.

### Three Paths Forward (pick one based on your answers above)

**Path A – Collaboration-first** (≤2 hours/week coding):  
Partner with someone who can handle the implementation while you focus on problem formulation, data interpretation, and domain expertise. You'd learn to read/modify code incrementally. *Best if you have advisor/collaborator support.*

**Path B – Structured learning sprint** (~10 hours/week, 8–12 weeks):  
Follow a coding bootcamp (Python basics → PyTorch/JAX basics → graph nets tutorial) in parallel with a tiny sea ice toy problem. Aim to reproduce one published baseline by week 8. *Best if you have time and no immediate deadline.*

**Path C – Tool-assisted shortcut** (~5 hours/week, 4–6 weeks):  
Use high-level libraries (PyTorch Geometric, DGL) and adapt existing sea ice GNN repos. Focus on running experiments and interpreting results rather than building from scratch. *Best if you can find a close-enough codebase to fork.*

**Next step**: Answer the five questions above, and I'll give you a concrete 2-week Phase 0 plan with specific resources, milestones, and a go/no-go decision point. If you're leaning toward one path already, mention that too.
