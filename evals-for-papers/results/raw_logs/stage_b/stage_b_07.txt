Short answer
Not saturated. Most deployed wildlife pipelines still rely on CNN detectors (e.g., MegaDetector) and YOLO variants rather than vision transformers, and very few papers convincingly demonstrate low-cost, on-device ViT-based counting with end-to-end energy/latency reporting in camera-trap or UAV settings. That leaves room for novelty if you (a) target edge-constrained deployment with rigorous energy–accuracy tradeoffs, (b) address long-tailed species and domain shift, and (c) evaluate sequence-level counting and uncertainty with appropriate ecological metrics [1][3][4][5][6].

Where the field looks crowded
- Generic wildlife detection with standard YOLO variants on workstation/cloud hardware; many incremental “improved YOLO” papers exist, including in forest/wildlife contexts [4].  
- Camera-trap detection pipelines that stop at detection and do not measure on-device costs; MegaDetector is the most widely used baseline in practice and is CNN-based [1][2].

Where novelty likely remains
- On-device ViT-based counting under strict resource budgets (Jetson/Coral/RPi), with hard evidence on energy, latency, and memory vs. strong CNN baselines like MegaDetector/YOLO [1][4].  
- Handling long-tailed distributions and domain shift across sites/seasons (common in camera-trap data) with ViT architectures and training protocols, reported with metrics that reflect rarity and utility for ecologists [3].  
- Sequence-aware counting for camera-trap bursts that exploits temporal context to reduce false positives/negatives under low compute budgets [6].  
- Aerial/UAV counting with edge-deployable models and annotation-efficient workflows; minimizing annotation and reporting deployment metrics is still an active area [7].  
- Uncertainty-aware counts (calibration and intervals) suitable for ecological decision-making; this is rarely reported alongside on-device constraints.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) Edge-deployable ViT vs. CNN baselines for camera-trap counting  
- Hypothesis: A lightweight ViT detector yields equal-or-better counting accuracy at similar or lower energy per image than YOLOv5s and MegaDetector on edge boards.  
- Setup: Train detectors on a public camera-trap dataset with individual/animal counts per frame; evaluate on held-out sites. Compare: ViT-based detector (tiny/mobile variant) vs. YOLOv5s and MegaDetector.  
- Metrics: mAP for detection, MAE/RMSE for per-image counts, FPS, energy per image (J), energy–delay product, peak memory, model size. Measure on Jetson (Nano/Xavier NX) and Coral.  
- Expected outcome: If the claim holds, the ViT variant will match/exceed count MAE at a lower or equal energy cost; if not, CNNs remain preferable on current edge hardware.  
- Rationale: CNNs dominate deployed pipelines [1][2][4]; showing a ViT Pareto win would be novel.

2) Robustness to long-tail and domain shift  
- Hypothesis: ViT-based models trained with long-tailed reweighting or focal losses generalize better across sites than CNNs at equal compute.  
- Setup: Train on region A, test zero-shot on region B (different species mix/backgrounds). Evaluate reweighting vs. standard training for both ViT and YOLO baselines.  
- Metrics: Class-balanced AP, macro-F1, tail-class AP, OOD performance drop (Δmacro-F1), calibration (ECE/Brier).  
- Expected outcome: Certain ViT setups reduce tail-class degradation and improve calibrated counts, aligning with camera-trap long-tail concerns [3].

3) Sequence-aware, low-cost counting for camera-trap bursts  
- Hypothesis: Simple temporal smoothing (e.g., burst-level non-max fusion or short-window tracking) on top of a tiny ViT detector reduces over/under-counting without increasing average energy per image beyond 10%.  
- Setup: Evaluate per-frame vs. per-burst counting on burst sequences. Implement a lightweight tracker or majority-vote smoothing.  
- Metrics: Count MAE/RMSE, false bursts per day, energy per image and per burst, latency.  
- Expected outcome: Temporal context reduces count error in cluttered/occluded scenes at small extra cost; relevant because sequence structure is underused in many pipelines [6].

Two additional targeted experiments (optional but helpful)
4) Quantization and distillation for edge ViTs  
- Test INT8 and (if supported) INT4 quantization and knowledge distillation to a tiny ViT head; measure the accuracy–energy tradeoff relative to FP16 baselines on Jetson/Coral.

5) UAV/aerial wildlife counting under altitudes and densities  
- Train tiny ViT vs. YOLO baselines on aerial imagery; vary altitude and animal density; measure count MAE and inference energy on an embedded platform carried by the UAV or at the field base station [7].

Minimum baselines and reporting for a convincing “low-cost ViT” paper
- Baselines: MegaDetector (or similar Faster R-CNN) and a modern lightweight YOLO (e.g., YOLOv5s/YOLOv8n) [1][4].  
- Datasets: At least one public camera-trap dataset and, if relevant, an aerial dataset; include cross-site evaluation to test domain shift [3][6].  
- Deployment metrics: FPS, latency, energy per image (with power meter or reliable tools), model size, memory footprint, thermal behavior.  
- Ecological utility: Report class-balanced metrics and tail performance; if providing counts for monitoring, include uncertainty measures and per-burst metrics when sequences exist [3].  
- Reproducibility: Release code, trained weights, and deployment recipes (Jetson/Coral/RPi), as these are often missing in wildlife ML works.

Bottom line
If you just “swap in a ViT” on a desktop and report accuracy, it will look incremental. If you deliver edge-deployable ViT-based counting with credible energy/latency measurements, robust tail-class performance across sites, and sequence-aware counting or aerial constraints, that’s still novel and useful to the community [1][3][6][7].
