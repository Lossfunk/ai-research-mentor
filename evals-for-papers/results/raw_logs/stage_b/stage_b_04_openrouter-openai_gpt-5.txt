Short answer: Feasible if you scope it tightly and lean on existing code. If you’re starting from zero coding, plan ~8–12 weeks part‑time to get a small, working graph model for short‑lead (1–3 day) sea‑ice concentration forecasts in one region. Faster if you collaborate with someone who codes; slower if you try to build everything from scratch.

A pragmatic path (beginner-friendly)
- Scope: Start with 1–3 day concentration forecasts for a single region (e.g., Hudson Bay) and a short time span (2–3 years). Ignore thickness/drift at first.
- Data: NSIDC/OSI‑SAF sea‑ice concentration (NetCDF), daily grids. Use xarray for loading and simple preprocessing (regridding to a coarser 25–50 km grid to keep compute small).
- Baselines before graphs: 
  - Persistence and climatology (1–2 hours to implement).
  - A small CNN/U‑Net or ConvLSTM from an existing repo or tutorial (don’t write it from scratch).
- First graph model: Adapt a standard spatiotemporal GNN (e.g., Graph WaveNet or DCRNN) from PyTorch Geometric Temporal/DGL examples to your grid-as-graph (4/8-nearest neighbors). Keep it tiny (hidden dim 32–64).
- Compute: One free Colab GPU is enough at this scale; keep batches small and resolution coarse.

Suggested learning and build plan
- Weeks 1–2: Basics
  - Python + NumPy + PyTorch crash course; Jupyter/Colab workflow.
  - xarray + NetCDF: load, subset, plot maps; compute persistence/climatology baselines.
- Weeks 3–4: Non-graph baseline
  - Train a tiny U‑Net/ConvLSTM on 2018–2019, validate 2020; target = next‑day concentration. Track RMSE and an ice‑edge metric (Integrated Ice Edge Error).
- Weeks 5–6: Graph setup
  - Build a grid graph (nodes=cells; edges=4/8-neighbors). Use PyTorch Geometric Temporal or DGL. Train Graph WaveNet/DCRNN on the same splits.
- Weeks 7–8: Clean evaluation and report
  - Compare graph vs CNN vs persistence. Add simple uncertainty (ensembles) if time. Write up methods, metrics, and failure cases.

What to do if you don’t want to code alone
- Team up: You handle problem framing, data, evaluation; a collaborator implements models. This can cut timeline to 4–6 weeks.
- Or start with a reproducibility project: pick one published sea-ice GNN/CNN paper and reproduce one figure/metric using their code or a close public baseline.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments to show progress
- E1. Graph vs CNN on short‑lead forecasts
  - Setup: 1‑day‑ahead concentration in Hudson Bay, 2018–2020 train, 2021 test; 25–50 km grid.
  - Claim to test: A small spatiotemporal GNN beats ConvLSTM/U‑Net and persistence on IIEE.
  - Pass/Fail: GNN reduces IIEE by ≥10% vs CNN and ≥20% vs persistence on 2021; otherwise no advantage.
- E2. Static vs dynamic edges
  - Setup: Compare static 8‑neighbor graph to a motion‑aware graph where edges follow previous‑day drift vectors (use publicly available drift products).
  - Pass/Fail: Dynamic-edges model improves edge‑region F1 by ≥0.05 at the same RMSE; else motion-aware edges not justified for this setup.
- E3. Resolution vs compute trade‑off
  - Setup: Train at 50 km and 25 km resolution with the same model capacity.
  - Pass/Fail: 25 km improves IIEE by ≥5% with training time ≤2×; if not, stick to 50 km for efficiency.

Risks and how to de‑risk
- Data wrangling pain: NetCDF/xarray can be tricky. Start with a small spatial window and a single sensor/algorithm (consistent OSI‑SAF product).
- Overfitting: Small regions/time windows can overfit; hold out entire years and report both RMSE and calibration.
- Compute creep: Keep models tiny; early stopping; coarse grids.

Bottom line
- Yes, it’s feasible as a first project if you keep the target narrow, reuse existing GNN/CNN examples, and focus on a clean comparison and write‑up. Pairing with an experienced coder speeds things up significantly.
