### **Phase 5: Your Research Project (3–6 months)**

Now you can attempt graph nets for sea ice:
1. **Reproduce a simple baseline** from existing papers
2. **Construct your graph** (e.g., grid cells as nodes, edges based on spatial proximity)
3. **Train a GNN** on historical sea-ice data
4. **Evaluate** against baselines (persistence, linear models, CNNs)

## Alternative: Collaborate Instead of Solo

If you want to contribute to this research **sooner**, consider:

### **Option 1: Join an Existing Team**
- Find a lab working on sea-ice forecasting or climate ML
- Contribute as a research assistant while learning
- **Where to look**:
  - [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) (community and job board)
  - Labs at universities with sea-ice research (e.g., University of Washington, MIT, University of Waterloo)
  - Contact authors of the papers I cited earlier

### **Option 2: Partner with a Coder**
- Find a collaborator with ML/coding skills
- You focus on domain knowledge (sea-ice physics, problem formulation)
- They handle implementation
- **Where to find collaborators**:
  - [Climate Change AI Slack](https://www.climatechange.ai/community)
  - University research groups
  - Hackathons (e.g., [Climate Hack](https://climatehack.ai/))

### **Option 3: Start with a Simpler Problem**
- Use **existing tools** that don't require coding:
  - Google Earth Engine (browser-based, JavaScript-like)
  - QGIS (GIS software, no coding)
  - Pre-built climate models
- Build domain expertise first, then learn to code

## Realistic Expectations

### **If you start from zero coding:**
- **3 months**: You can write basic Python scripts, load data, make plots
- **6 months**: You can train simple ML models (linear regression, random forests)
- **9 months**: You can implement a basic neural network from tutorials
- **12 months**: You can attempt GNNs on toy problems
- **18 months**: You can tackle sea-ice forecasting with GNNs

### **Red flags that you're not ready:**
- You can't load a CSV file and compute the mean of a column
- You don't understand what a training/test split is
- You've never trained any ML model (even simple ones)
- You can't debug basic Python errors

---

## My Honest Recommendation

**Don't start with this project.** Instead:

1. **Spend 3–6 months learning Python and basic ML** (Phases 1–2 above)
2. **Build 2–3 simpler projects** to gain confidence:
   - Predict housing prices with linear regression
   - Classify images with a CNN (MNIST or CIFAR-10)
   - Forecast time series with an LSTM (stock prices, weather)
3. **Then** attempt graph nets on a simpler domain (e.g., social networks, molecules)
4. **Finally** tackle sea-ice forecasting once you have the full skill stack

**Why?** Jumping straight to a complex problem will lead to:
- Frustration (you'll get stuck constantly)
- Wasted time (debugging issues you don't understand)
- Poor results (you won't know if your model is bad or your code is buggy)

## If You Insist on Starting Now

Here's a **minimal viable path** (still very challenging):

1. **Week 1–2**: Complete a Python crash course (e.g., [Kaggle's Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python))
2. **Week 3–4**: Complete [Kaggle's Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
3. **Week 5–8**: Complete [Fast.ai Part 1](https://course.fast.ai/) (deep learning basics)
4. **Week 9–12**: Work through [PyTorch Geometric tutorials](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/)
5. **Week 13–16**: Download sea-ice data, build a simple graph, train a basic GNN

**Success rate**: Low (~10–20%) without prior coding experience. Most people will need the longer timeline.

---

## Bottom Line

**Graph nets for sea ice is a great research goal, but not a first project.** You need 6–12 months of foundational learning first. Consider:
- **Collaborating** with someone who can code (fastest path to results)
- **Following the structured learning path** above (most sustainable)
- **Starting with simpler ML projects** to build skills incrementally

Research is a marathon, not a sprint. Invest in the fundamentals now, and you'll be far more effective later.
