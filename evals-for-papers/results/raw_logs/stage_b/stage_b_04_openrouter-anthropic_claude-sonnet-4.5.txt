**Short answer: Feasible, but challenging.** You'll need to invest significant time learning to code before you can execute this research. Here's a realistic assessment:

## The Reality Check

### What This Project Requires

1. **Python programming**: Data loading, preprocessing, visualization
2. **Deep learning frameworks**: PyTorch or TensorFlow/JAX for implementing GNNs
3. **Graph libraries**: PyTorch Geometric, DGL, or similar
4. **Scientific computing**: NumPy, pandas, xarray (for climate data)
5. **Geospatial data handling**: Working with NetCDF files, satellite data, coordinate systems
6. **Experiment management**: Version control (Git), logging, hyperparameter tuning

### Time Investment Estimate

- **Basic Python proficiency**: 2-3 months (if studying intensively)
- **Deep learning fundamentals**: 2-3 months
- **Graph neural networks**: 1-2 months
- **Domain-specific skills** (climate data, sea ice): 1-2 months
- **Total before starting research**: ~6-12 months of learning

## Two Paths Forward

### Path A: Learn First, Research Later (Recommended)

**Month 1-3: Python & Scientific Computing**
- Course: "Python for Data Science" (Coursera, DataCamp, or similar)
- Practice: Kaggle tutorials, small data analysis projects
- Goal: Comfortable with NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

**Month 4-6: Deep Learning Basics**
- Course: Fast.ai "Practical Deep Learning" or Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization
- Practice: Implement simple CNNs, RNNs from scratch
- Goal: Understand backpropagation, training loops, evaluation

**Month 7-8: Graph Neural Networks**
- Resources: Stanford CS224W, PyTorch Geometric tutorials
- Practice: Implement basic GNN on toy datasets (citation networks, molecules)
- Goal: Understand message passing, graph construction

**Month 9-10: Climate Data & Sea Ice**
- Learn: xarray, working with NetCDF files, sea ice datasets (NSIDC, ERA5)
- Practice: Load and visualize sea ice concentration data
- Goal: Understand your data domain

**Month 11-12: Integrate & Prototype**
- Reproduce a simple baseline (e.g., persistence model, linear regression)
- Build your first graph from sea ice data
- Run initial GNN experiments

### Path B: Collaborate Now (Faster to Results)

**Find collaborators who can code:**
- Partner with a CS/ML student or postdoc
- You contribute: domain knowledge, problem formulation, interpretation
- They contribute: implementation, technical execution
- **Where to find**: Lab meetings, interdisciplinary workshops, online research communities

**Your role while learning:**
- Literature review and problem scoping
- Data acquisition and understanding
- Experimental design and result interpretation
- Writing and communication

## Hybrid Approach (Most Realistic)

1. **Start learning immediately** (Path A, months 1-3)
2. **Simultaneously seek collaborators** (Path B)
3. **Contribute what you can** as your skills grow
4. **Take ownership of specific components** (e.g., data preprocessing, visualization, writing)

## Concrete First Steps (This Week)

### If Going Solo:
1. **Install Python**: Anaconda distribution
2. **Start a beginner course**: "Python for Everybody" (free, Coursera) or "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
3. **Set a daily practice goal**: 1-2 hours of coding
4. **Join communities**: r/learnpython, Stack Overflow

### If Seeking Collaboration:
1. **Write a 1-page project proposal**: Problem, why GNNs, what you bring
2. **Identify potential collaborators**: 
   - Your institution's CS/ML department
   - Climate informatics community (climateinformatics.org)
   - AI for Earth Sciences groups
3. **Reach out**: Be clear about your skills and what you're looking for
4. **Offer value**: Domain expertise, data access, writing skills

## Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ Expecting to publish in 3-6 months with no coding background
- ❌ Trying to learn everything at once (leads to burnout)
- ❌ Skipping fundamentals to jump straight to GNNs
- ❌ Working in isolation without feedback

## Green Flags for Success

- ✅ Consistent daily practice (even 30 min/day)
- ✅ Building projects, not just watching tutorials
- ✅ Asking for help when stuck (communities, mentors)
- ✅ Starting with simpler models before GNNs (e.g., MLPs, CNNs on sea ice)
- ✅ Having a mentor or advisor who supports this learning path

## My Honest Recommendation

**If you have 6-12 months and strong motivation**: Go for Path A. Many successful researchers started with no coding experience.

**If you want results sooner or have limited time**: Pursue Path B (collaboration) while building skills on the side.

**If you're a student/early career**: This is the perfect time to invest in learning—it will pay off for your entire career.

**If you're established in another field**: Collaboration might be more efficient, but learning to code will make you a better collaborator.

## Question for You

**What's your timeline and context?**
- Are you a student, postdoc, or established researcher?
- Do you have 6-12 months to dedicate to learning?
- Is there institutional support (courses, mentors, potential collaborators)?
- What's driving this interest—a specific research question or general curiosity?

Your answer will help me give more tailored advice on whether this is feasible **for you specifically**.
