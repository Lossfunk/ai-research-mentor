Short answer
Replicating the paper’s Section 3.4 “LLM-as-a-Judge” requires you to (a) freeze a taxonomy and rubric before any scoring, (b) run a blinded, rubric‑driven judging prompt with fixed hyperparameters on a strictly held‑out evaluation split, (c) aggregate multiple independent judge calls and report agreement, and (d) validate against a small human‑labeled subset. The main leakage risk is iteratively refining the taxonomy, rubric, or judge prompt using feedback from the same evaluation instances you later score; prevent this with a clean dev/eval split, a preregistered rubric, and a change log that triggers re‑evaluation when anything changes. LLM‑judge bias toward style, position, and model identity can also confound results; mitigate via anonymization, order randomization, and cross‑model judges [P8]. Preference bias of judges toward certain output styles or their own model family is a known issue, so consider cross‑judges or debiasing methods [P2].

Key components to reproduce
- Task splits and frozen taxonomy
  - Create a strict dev split used only to develop/refine the failure taxonomy and category rubrics; freeze both before evaluation on a disjoint eval split.
  - Treat examples in the judge prompt as part of the taxonomy/rubric; they must come only from the dev split (or external sources) and be frozen before scoring eval.
- Judge model and prompt
  - Specify judge model(s), temperature, sampling params, and the full rubric prompt text verbatim.
  - Require structured outputs (category labels, justification, confidence) to reduce parsing ambiguity and enable auditability.
- Multiple judgments and aggregation
  - Use n>1 independent judgments per instance (seeds or judge replicas) and define the aggregation rule (e.g., majority vote, medians of ordinal scores, confidence‑weighted).
  - Randomize presentation order for pairwise comparisons to reduce position bias [P8].
- Reliability and calibration
  - Compute inter‑judge reliability (e.g., Cohen’s κ/Krippendorff’s α) and judge–human agreement on a small, blinded, gold subset.
  - Consider cross‑model judges (e.g., judge A and judge B) to detect self‑preference bias [P2], and report correlations across judges.
- Blinding and anonymization
  - Remove system identifiers and style cues not essential to content (e.g., model names, temperature, chain‑of‑thought verbosity) to mitigate style and identity biases [P8].
- Reporting for reproducibility
  - Release: taxonomy definitions, judge prompt(s), seeds and hyperparameters, splits, aggregation code, and raw judge outputs plus parsed labels.

High‑risk pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Leakage between taxonomy/rubric development and evaluation:
  - Pitfall: Iteratively adjusting categories, definitions, thresholds, or in‑context exemplars after inspecting evaluation results.
    - Safeguard: Pre‑register and freeze taxonomy, rubric, and exemplars before any eval scoring; any change invalidates prior eval and requires a fresh run on a new held‑out set.
  - Pitfall: Using examples from the eval split inside the judge prompt or rubric.
    - Safeguard: Source exemplars from the dev split or external data only, and track prompt provenance.
  - Pitfall: Manually “peeking” at eval outputs while refining the rubric.
    - Safeguard: Access control and a change log; evaluation remains blinded to the team refining the rubric.
- LLM‑as‑judge biases and instability:
  - Style/verbosity and position bias can flip judgments irrespective of content; use order randomization, length normalization, and style‑matched comparisons [P8].
  - Judge self‑preference and family bias; prefer cross‑model judges and report consistency; consider debiasing or calibration strategies [P2].
- Aggregation/metrics traps:
  - Unstable majority votes with small n; increase judge samples or use tie‑breaking rules; report uncertainty intervals.
  - Mixing binary and ordinal category scorings without clear thresholds; define per‑category scales and thresholds ex ante.
- Overfitting to a narrow task slice:
  - Ensure the eval split covers the same distribution as the intended deployment; if taxonomy was derived on a narrow subset, test external validity on an additional out‑of‑distribution set.

Concrete, falsifiable experiments to validate your replication and check leakage
1) Split‑swap taxonomy validation
   - Hypothesis: A taxonomy and rubric derived on split A generalize to split B without material drift in category prevalence or judge agreement; deriving on B then testing on A yields similar metrics.
   - Variables: Split used for taxonomy (A vs B), evaluation split (B vs A).
   - Metrics: Per‑category prevalence delta, judge–human agreement (κ), cross‑judge correlation; two‑sample tests on prevalence.
   - Expected outcome: Small, statistically insignificant differences; large shifts indicate overfitting/leakage to the development split.

2) In‑context exemplar leakage test
   - Hypothesis: Removing all in‑context examples or replacing them with synthetic/out‑of‑domain exemplars does not materially change category assignments on the eval set if no leakage exists.
   - Variables: Prompt condition (dev exemplars vs synthetic vs none).
   - Metrics: Label stability (exact match rate), prevalence deltas, judge confidence differences; McNemar’s test on label changes.
   - Expected outcome: High stability; large shifts imply the exemplars carried dataset‑specific cues (potential leakage).

3) Judge bias and robustness battery
   - Hypothesis: Judgments are invariant to style and position when content is held constant, and consistent across judge models.
   - Variables: Style‑matched paraphrases (verbosity/politeness varied), position (A/B order), judge model (J1 vs J2).
   - Metrics: Flip rate under style/position perturbations; agreement across judges; effect sizes.
   - Expected outcome: Low flip rates and high cross‑judge agreement; elevated flip rates indicate style/position bias [P8].

4) Identity‑blindness check (self‑preference bias)
   - Hypothesis: Hiding system identity eliminates any advantage for a system judged by its own model family.
   - Variables: Prompt condition (identity present vs anonymized), judge model family.
   - Metrics: Win‑rate differences and label shifts between conditions.
   - Expected outcome: Minimal differences when anonymized; gaps suggest self‑preference bias [P2].

Practical replication checklist (to avoid leakage)
- Before evaluation: finalize taxonomy, per‑category rubric text, judge prompt, in‑context examples (from dev only), model(s), seeds, and parameters; record in a preregistration doc.
- Data: enforce a strict dev/eval split; freeze eval instances; forbid manual inspection during taxonomy/rubric tuning.
- During evaluation: anonymize systems; randomize order; collect k independent judgments per instance; log raw judge outputs.
- After evaluation: compute inter‑judge reliability and judge–human agreement; publish prompts, splits, seeds, and raw outputs.
