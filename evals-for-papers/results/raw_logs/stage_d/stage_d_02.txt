Below is a concrete, testable plan to evaluate a third intervention type—a standardized communication protocol (SCP)—for mitigating Inter‑Agent Misalignment (IAM) in multi‑agent LLM systems, along with MST-aligned baselines and appropriate statistical testing.

Intervention to test: Standardized Communication Protocol (SCP)
Goal: reduce “Inter‑Agent Misalignment” failures without shifting errors into other failure modes.

Key elements to implement
- Typed message schema: Each inter-agent message must include: intent (e.g., propose/ask/commit/clarify), target entity references (with canonical IDs/ontology), task state pointer, and confidence. Messages that fail JSON Schema validation are rejected and must be repaired.
- Shared ontology + disambiguation: All references to goals, constraints, entities, and roles map to a shared KB. Agents must resolve ambiguous references via dedicated “clarify” messages before acting.
- Plan/commit protocol: Proposals must be acknowledged by the counterparty with “accept” (commit) or “reject” (with reasons). No irreversible step proceeds without an accepted plan.
- Responsibility register: Each subtask has a unique “owner” field; the coordinator (or shared memory) enforces non-overlapping ownership to prevent divergent parallel plans.
- Consistency checks: At fixed checkpoints, a designated verifier agent checks that all agents’ belief states agree on: goal statement, constraints, resources, ownership, and next step.

What to measure
- Primary: proportion of runs labeled as IAM according to the MST taxonomy; and the full distribution across failure modes, to detect error trade-offs.
- Secondary: task success rate, time/turns to completion, token cost, and number of “clarify” and “repair” cycles.

Baselines to include (from MST)
Mirror the intervention baselines MST used in Appendix F so the comparison is commensurate:
- No-intervention baseline: original MAS configuration and prompts as defined in MST. [P1]
- Prompt-based intervention: role-specific prompt refinement (e.g., stronger cooperation instructions, reflection) without changing topology. [P1]
- Topological intervention: rewiring the agent graph (e.g., central coordinator/moderator, reviewer loops) without prompt changes. [P1]
Your SCP constitutes a third class (protocol-level/coordination mechanism). Run all three MST baselines plus SCP on the same task suite, with identical tasks, seeds, and models to isolate the effect of the intervention. MST reports that topological changes outperformed prompt-only tweaks in intervention case studies, which makes them the most informative active baseline to compare against. [P1]

Experimental design
- Tasks and seeds: Use the same MST task set where IAM was frequently observed. Run n seeds per task per condition (e.g., 20–50), keeping LLM, temperature, and tool access identical.
- Annotation: Two independent annotators label failure modes per MST taxonomy; adjudicate disagreements; report inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s κ).
- Conditions: 4 conditions total—No‑Intervention, Prompt, Topology, SCP—plus ablations of SCP (see Experiments below).
- Controls: Fix message budgets, max turns, and tool permissions across conditions. Log full transcripts.

Statistical tests for comparing failure mode distributions
Let K be the number of failure categories in the MST taxonomy.

- If runs are paired by task/seed (recommended):
  - Overall shift in the K‑category distribution: Stuart–Maxwell or Bhapkar test for marginal homogeneity on paired multinomial outcomes.
  - Targeted test on IAM vs. non‑IAM: McNemar’s test on paired binary indicators (IAM present vs not).
  - Effect sizes: Cramer’s V (for K‑category shift), odds ratio for IAM.
- If runs are unpaired (independent samples):
  - Overall shift: chi‑square test of homogeneity (use Fisher–Freeman–Halton exact test if expected counts are small).
  - IAM proportion difference: two‑proportion z‑test with continuity correction or Fisher’s exact test (small n).
- Model-based analysis (recommended in addition to tests above):
  - Mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression: outcome = failure category; fixed effect for condition (No‑Intervention/Prompt/Topology/SCP), random intercepts for task and seed; cluster‑robust SEs by task.
  - For IAM specifically, mixed-effects logistic regression with the same random effects.
  - Overdispersion: consider a Dirichlet–multinomial model; report posterior for ΔP(IAM) < 0 under SCP.
- Resampling and multiplicity:
  - Bootstrap CIs (BCa) for per-category proportions and for the difference in IAM rates.
  - Permutation tests for robustness on small samples.
  - Control multiple comparisons across categories with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) SCP vs strongest MST baselines on IAM-heavy tasks
- Hypothesis: A schema-validated, acknowledgment-based protocol reduces IAM rate relative to Topology-only and Prompt-only baselines.
- Design: Paired runs per task/seed across four conditions (No‑Intervention, Prompt, Topology, SCP).
- Metrics: P(IAM), full failure-mode distribution, success rate, turns, token cost.
- Tests: Stuart–Maxwell for K‑category shift; McNemar for IAM; mixed-effects multinomial regression for condition effects.
- Expected outcome: SCP yields a statistically significant decrease in IAM with no significant increase in other failure modes (FDR-controlled).

2) SCP ablation: which component prevents misalignment?
- Hypothesis: The plan/commit protocol and ontology-based disambiguation are the critical components; removing either increases IAM.
- Design: Compare SCP-Full vs SCP-no-Commit, SCP-no-Ontology, SCP-no-Validation (free text), and SCP-no-Verifier.
- Metrics: P(IAM) and rate of “conflicting plans” subtypes; number of repair cycles.
- Tests: For each ablation vs SCP-Full, McNemar on IAM (paired) and chi-square/Fisher–Freeman–Halton on the K‑category table; adjust via BH-FDR.
- Expected outcome: SCP-no-Commit and SCP-no-Ontology show the largest increases in IAM; SCP-no-Validation increases both IAM and general “spec violation” errors.

3) Generalization across topologies: SCP as a portability layer
- Hypothesis: SCP’s benefit is robust across topologies and narrows the gap between Prompt-only and Topology interventions.
- Design: Cross the communication protocol factor (None vs SCP) with two topologies (e.g., flat peer-to-peer vs centralized coordinator) used in MST.
- Metrics: ΔP(IAM) from adding SCP within each topology; interaction term in model.
- Tests: Mixed-effects logistic and multinomial models with interaction: Protocol × Topology; permutation test of interaction for robustness.
- Expected outcome: Significant main effect for SCP and a smaller or non-significant interaction, indicating SCP reduces IAM irrespective of topology.

Reporting and power
- Pre-register analysis, taxonomy mapping, and primary endpoints (IAM proportion and K‑category distribution).
- Target power via pilot: estimate baseline P(IAM) and variance; size to detect a 25–30% relative reduction with 80% power (paired design typically needs fewer runs).
- Report effect sizes (odds ratios, Cramer’s V) and uncertainty (CIs or posterior intervals), not just p-values.

Why these choices
- MST’s Appendix F indicates topological changes outperform prompt tweaks, so both are critical baselines next to your SCP intervention. [P1]
- You are comparing categorical outcomes (failure modes) under interventions; paired tests (Stuart–Maxwell/Bhapkar, McNemar) and mixed-effects models are standard for marginal homogeneity and for handling task-level clustering, while chi-square/Fisher variants cover unpaired or small-sample regimes. Comparing interventional distributions directly aligns with principled evaluation of interventions.
