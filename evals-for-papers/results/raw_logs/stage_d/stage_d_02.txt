Short answer
- Intervention to test: a standardized communication protocol (SCP) that forces agents to exchange structured, machine-parseable messages (e.g., role, beliefs, plan, commitments, uncertainty, and acknowledgments) and to verify mutual understanding before acting.
- Baselines to use from the MST paper: (i) the no-intervention baseline, (ii) the best-performing prompt-based intervention(s), and (iii) the best-performing topological intervention(s) reported in Appendix F, plus their combined version if the paper included it. Run your SCP alongside these, under the same tasks, seeds, and evaluation criteria as Appendix F.
- Appropriate statistics for comparing failure mode distributions: chi-squared test of independence (or G-test) on the contingency table; use Fisher’s exact if counts are small. If runs are paired (same instance pre/post), use McNemar’s test for a binary misalignment indicator or the Stuart–Maxwell test for multi-category outcomes. For effect sizes and robustness, report Cramér’s V, bootstrap confidence intervals for divergence metrics (e.g., Jensen–Shannon or total variation), and a multinomial/Dirichlet-multinomial regression as a confirmatory model with cluster-robust SEs. Control multiple comparisons with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR.

Proposed intervention and experiment design
Define the Standardized Communication Protocol (SCP)
- Message schema: Each message is a structured object with fixed fields: role, subgoal, current belief state (key facts with provenance), intended action, rationale, confidence, and requests/clarifications.
- Handshake and commit: Before executing actions that affect others, an agent must (1) propose plan fragment; (2) receive a structured acknowledgment containing an echo of the plan and any conflicts; (3) produce a commit message; execution proceeds only after successful echo-match.
- Referential grounding: Entities must be referenced via canonical IDs established in a “grounding table” maintained by a coordinator or shared memory; agents can only refer by ID, not free text labels.
- Uncertainty thresholding: If confidence < τ on either side, the protocol mandates a clarifying question rather than proceeding.
- Protocol adherence checks: Automatic validators reject messages that miss fields, violate schema, or fail echo/ID checks; rejected episodes are retried with the same seed to isolate protocol effects from stochasticity.

What to measure
- Primary: proportion of episodes labeled “Inter-Agent Misalignment” and the full failure-mode distribution.
- Secondary: task success rate, time-to-success (turns), tokens, protocol violations, and number of clarifications/acks.

Baselines to include (from your paper’s Appendix F)
- No-intervention (vanilla) baseline as used in Appendix F.
- Prompt-based baseline(s): use exactly the prompt-based intervention(s) Appendix F evaluated (e.g., role reminders, self-verification prompts—use the paper’s actual variants).
- Topological baseline(s): use the topological change(s) Appendix F evaluated (e.g., hub-and-spoke coordinator, restricted broadcast—again, use the paper’s actual variants).
- If the paper evaluated a combined prompt+topology setting, include it as a baseline.
- SCP ablations: remove one component at a time (no handshake; no referential IDs; no uncertainty threshold; no acknowledgments) to isolate which elements drive gains.

If you share Appendix F or attach the PDF, I’ll map these to the paper’s exact intervention names and settings.

Three concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) SCP-Handshake + Commit vs. baselines
- Hypothesis: Requiring a structured handshake and explicit commit reduces Inter-Agent Misalignment failure rate compared to no-intervention, prompt-only, and topology-only baselines.
- Design: Use the identical task suite and seeds as Appendix F. Conditions: Baselines above + SCP. N episodes per task per condition matched to Appendix F for power. Blind, dual annotators label failure modes; adjudicate disagreements; report Cohen’s κ.
- Metrics: Misalignment rate; full failure-mode distribution; Cramér’s V for distribution shift; message turns; tokens; protocol violations.
- Stats: Chi-squared test on K-category failure distributions across conditions; if per-instance pairing is possible, Stuart–Maxwell test for marginal homogeneity. Report BH-FDR across tasks; bootstrap 95% CI for JS-divergence between distributions. Multinomial regression with intervention as predictor and random intercepts for task/seed.

2) SCP-Referential Grounding (canonical IDs) ablation
- Hypothesis: Enforcing referential IDs specifically reduces misalignment subtypes involving ambiguous references (predefine subtype rubric).
- Design: Compare SCP-full vs. SCP-minus-IDs vs. best topology baseline. Same seeds and tasks. Add automatic detectors for out-of-schema references and ID mismatches.
- Metrics: Overall misalignment rate; subtype rate for referential errors; protocol violations; success rate.
- Stats: For subtype proportion, McNemar’s test if paired binary per-episode labels (referential misalignment yes/no); else chi-squared for multi-category. Report risk ratios with bootstrap CIs. Correct for multiple comparisons via BH-FDR.

3) SCP-Uncertainty Thresholding (τ) dose-response
- Hypothesis: Tighter uncertainty thresholds (higher τ) monotonically decrease misalignment but may increase turns/tokens; there exists a sweet-spot τ* maximizing success per token.
- Design: Conditions: τ ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9} within SCP; compare to best prompt and best topology baselines. Pre-register a monotone trend test.
- Metrics: Misalignment rate; total turns and tokens; success rate; timeouts.
- Stats: Cochran–Armitage trend test for misalignment vs τ; ANCOVA or GLM for cost metrics; Holm–BH correction across τ levels. Secondary: permutation test on JS-divergence between τ=0 and τ=0.9.

Statistical analysis details
- Primary comparison of failure-mode distributions: chi-squared test of independence on a K×C contingency table (K failure categories × C conditions). Check expected cell counts; if sparse, use Monte Carlo p-values or a permutation test. Report Cramér’s V and bootstrap CIs.
- Paired designs: If you can pair episodes by instance/seed, use McNemar’s test for a binary misalignment indicator; for multi-category failure labels, use the Stuart–Maxwell test.
- Model-based confirmation: Fit a multinomial (or Dirichlet–multinomial) regression with intervention as fixed effect and scenario/seed as random effect; test overall intervention effect via likelihood-ratio test.
- Divergence summary: Report JS-divergence or total variation distance between failure distributions with bootstrap CIs to complement NHST.
- Multiple comparisons: Control FDR across tasks and outcomes using Benjamini–Hochberg. Pre-specify a primary endpoint to avoid multiplicity inflation.
- Power: Use historical Appendix F rates to simulate power for chi-squared/Stuart–Maxwell at your planned N; target ≥80% power for a minimum detectable Cramér’s V you deem practical.

Controls, ablations, and reproducibility
- Manipulation checks: Log schema-adherence rate, echo-match success, and ID coverage. If adherence is low, the intervention wasn’t applied effectively—interpret results cautiously.
- Message budget parity: Fix or report token budgets across conditions; analyze cost-adjusted effects.
- Robustness: Vary the LLM base model and temperature; replicate on at least two task suites if available in the paper.
- Pre-registration: Specify hypotheses, primary endpoints (e.g., misalignment rate), analysis plan, and stopping rules. Release code, prompts, schemas, and raw logs.

What I still need
- The exact Appendix F interventions and task settings to name the baselines precisely and to size the study for power. If you can share the PDF or the specific variant names and their observed misalignment rates, I’ll map the baselines and produce a power table.

Key takeaways
- Test a structured SCP (handshake, commitments, referential IDs, and uncertainty thresholding) against the precise Appendix F prompt and topology baselines, under identical tasks/seeds.
- Use chi-squared/Stuart–Maxwell (or permutation) to compare full failure-mode distributions, with effect sizes and bootstrap CIs, and confirm via multinomial modeling.
- Pre-register, include ablations, and report protocol adherence to ensure that any gains are attributable to the communication protocol itself.
