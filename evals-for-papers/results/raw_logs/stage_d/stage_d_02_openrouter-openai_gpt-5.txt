Below is a concrete experiment plan to evaluate a third intervention class—standardized communication protocol (SCP)—targeting Inter-Agent Misalignment, along with baselines to include and appropriate statistical tests for comparing failure distributions.

Goal
- Test whether enforcing a standardized communication protocol reduces Inter-Agent Misalignment relative to the paper’s prompt-based and topological interventions, using the same taxonomy and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation procedure as in the paper’s methodology (Section 3.4) [1]. Appendix F reports that topological changes outperform prompt-only interventions; these should be used as baselines [1][2].

Intervention: Standardized Communication Protocol (SCP)
- Core idea: Agents must use a typed, machine-checkable message schema and finite-state dialogue moves (speech acts) to communicate intent, responsibilities, and agreements. This draws on established agent communication principles (e.g., FIPA ACL) [3].
- Message schema fields:
  - header: sender_id, receiver_id, role, timestamp
  - intent: one of {inform, request, propose, agree, commit, decline, query, confirm, retract, terminate}
  - goal_id: globally shared UUID for current goal/subgoal
  - constraints: structured key-value constraints (e.g., budget ≤ X, latency ≤ Y)
  - plan_hash: hash of the current shared plan or subplan text
  - belief_version: monotonic counter for shared context
  - commitment_id and deadline: for trackable commitments
  - confidence: 0–1 self-reported confidence for transparency
- Protocol mechanics:
  - Handshake/consensus: Every new or revised plan must traverse propose → agree → commit, with an automatic consensus check on goal_id and plan_hash; a mismatch triggers a required clarify → confirm loop.
  - Compliance enforcement: A parser validates schema and allowed transitions (finite-state machine). Nonconforming messages are rejected with an automatic request to rephrase using the schema.
  - Traceability: All messages and state transitions are logged to compute compliance rate and to support post-hoc auditing of misalignment traces.

Experimental design
- Tasks and data: Use the same task suite and evaluation taxonomy as the paper; freeze taxonomy, prompts, and judge configuration before running the experiment, per Section 3.4 [1]. Keep all evaluation examples disjoint from any development used to design the SCP.
- Systems/conditions:
  1) Baseline A: Original system (no intervention), as in the paper [1].
  2) Baseline B: Prompt-based intervention from Appendix F [1][2].
  3) Baseline C: Topological intervention from Appendix F (e.g., role/topology changes) [1][2].
  4) Treatment: SCP enforced (protocol + parser + handshake).
  5) Optional: SCP + Topological intervention to test additivity.
- Execution:
  - For each task, run each condition with k seeds (e.g., k=5–10) to quantify variance, following the paper’s multi-run practice [1].
  - Keep decoding and judge parameters fixed across conditions.
  - Blind model identities and randomize task order to limit judge/system bias.
- Outcomes:
  - Primary: Proportion of Inter-Agent Misalignment failures as judged by the LLM-as-a-Judge taxonomy [1].
  - Secondary: Full failure-mode distribution across categories; protocol compliance rate; task success rate and latency/turns.

Concrete, falsifiable experiments
1) SCP effectiveness on misalignment
- Design: Compare Inter-Agent Misalignment rate across Baselines A–C vs SCP (and optionally SCP+Topo) on the held-out evaluation set.
- Falsifiable outcome: Pre-register a minimal detectable effect (e.g., ≥30% relative reduction vs Baseline A). If the observed reduction is below this with 95% CI overlapping zero, conclude SCP does not materially reduce misalignment under current settings.

2) Protocol ablation study
- Design: Compare three variants: schema-only (no enforcement), schema+parser (rejects malformed messages), full SCP (parser + handshake consensus). Everything else is held constant.
- Falsifiable outcome: If schema-only ≈ baseline but full SCP shows a significant reduction, infer enforcement and consensus checks—not just templated messages—drive the effect.

3) Speech-act importance test
- Design: Replace typed intents with free-form messages while keeping schema fields, or swap intent labels with randomized synonyms (control for superficial prompt effects).
- Falsifiable outcome: If misalignment increases or reverts toward baseline without typed intents, conclude speech-act typing contributes causally to mitigation.

4) Robustness and generalization
- Design: Evaluate SCP on held-out, more coordination-heavy tasks (or higher agent counts) without additional tuning.
- Falsifiable outcome: If reductions persist within a pre-registered margin (e.g., within 20% of base effect size), claim preliminary generalization; otherwise, the effect is task-specific.

Recommended baselines from the paper
- No-intervention baseline (original multi-agent configuration) [1].
- Prompt-based intervention baseline(s) from Appendix F (e.g., enhanced role prompts or coordination prompts used by the authors) [1][2].
- Topological intervention baseline(s) from Appendix F (e.g., supervisor or coordinator topologies) [1][2].
- Use the same judge rubric and categorization pipeline (Section 3.4) to ensure comparability across conditions [1].

Statistical analysis for failure-mode distributions
- Unit of analysis: Individual task-runs (task × seed × condition). Cluster by task if tasks repeat.
- Primary test on Inter-Agent Misalignment (binary per run):
  - If independent runs: two-proportion z-test or logistic regression with condition as a fixed effect; report risk difference/ratio with 95% CIs.
  - If paired design (same tasks evaluated across conditions with matched seeds): McNemar’s test per category; report odds ratio and CI.
  - Prefer mixed-effects logistic regression: misalignment ~ condition + (1|task) + (1|seed) with cluster-robust or bootstrap CIs, to account for task heterogeneity.
- Full distribution across categories:
  - Chi-square test of homogeneity on multinomial counts across conditions.
  - If paired: Bowker’s test of symmetry on the paired contingency table, or a permutation test on label vectors within tasks.
  - As an alternative, fit a Dirichlet-multinomial regression with condition as a predictor and compare via likelihood-ratio test; report category-specific marginal effects with bootstrapped CIs.
- Multiple comparisons:
  - When testing multiple categories or ablations, control FDR with Benjamini–Hochberg; for a small number of planned tests, Holm–Bonferroni is acceptable.
- Uncertainty and power:
  - Report Wilson CIs for proportions; bootstrap CIs clustered by task for robustness.
  - Pre-compute power for the primary endpoint given expected baseline misalignment rates; adjust k (seeds) or N (tasks) accordingly.
- Sensitivity checks:
  - Re-score a subset with human annotators to confirm judge stability and estimate judge–human agreement before applying conclusions [1].
  - Repeat analyses with a second judge family to assess judge-family bias; conclusions should not change qualitatively if the effect is real.

Practical tips to avoid leakage or bias
- Freeze taxonomy, prompts, judge, and SCP spec before touching the evaluation set; restrict all iteration to a separate development split [1].
- Do not derive SCP message examples from evaluation traces; use synthetic or development-set traces instead.
- Keep judge prompts free of evaluation examples; report version hashes for judge and SCP configs for reproducibility.

Key takeaways
- Use the paper’s no-intervention, prompt-based, and topological baselines to anchor comparisons [1][2].
- Evaluate an enforceable, typed communication protocol with consensus checks; test with ablations to isolate what matters.
- Analyze both the primary misalignment rate and the full failure distribution, using paired/unpaired tests as appropriate and mixed-effects models for robustness.
