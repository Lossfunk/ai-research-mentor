Based on the MST (Multi-Agent System failure Taxonomy) paper's methodology, I can provide guidance on designing your standardized communication protocol intervention experiment. Let me outline the key components:

## Experimental Design for Communication Protocol Intervention

### 1. **Baseline Selection from the Paper**

You should use these baselines for comparison:

- **No intervention baseline**: The original multi-agent system configuration that exhibits Inter-Agent Misalignment failures
- **Prompt-based intervention baseline**: From Appendix F, this likely includes interventions like clarifying agent roles, adding explicit coordination instructions, or improving task descriptions
- **Topological intervention baseline**: Structural changes such as adding mediator agents, changing communication patterns, or modifying agent hierarchies

### 2. **Designing the Communication Protocol Intervention**

For a standardized communication protocol to address Inter-Agent Misalignment, consider:

**Protocol Components:**
- **Message format standardization**: Define structured message templates (e.g., JSON schemas with fields for: sender_id, recipient_id, message_type, content, context, priority)
- **Handshaking mechanisms**: Require acknowledgment/confirmation messages to verify understanding
- **Semantic alignment checks**: Include metadata about intent, expected response type, and success criteria
- **Turn-taking rules**: Explicit protocols for when agents should speak, listen, or wait
- **Conflict resolution procedures**: Predefined steps when agents disagree or provide contradictory information

**Implementation Considerations:**
- The protocol should be enforced at the framework level, not just suggested in prompts
- Include logging/tracing to verify protocol compliance
- Consider both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns

### 3. **Experimental Setup**

**Test Suite:**
- Use the same benchmark tasks from the MST paper that exhibited Inter-Agent Misalignment
- Ensure task diversity across domains (the paper likely uses multiple domains)
- Maintain consistent LLM backbone, temperature, and other hyperparameters

**Metrics to Collect:**
- **Primary**: Failure mode distribution (proportion of each failure type)
- **Secondary**: Task success rate, number of communication rounds, token usage, latency
- **Protocol-specific**: Message format compliance rate, acknowledgment success rate, conflict instances

### 4. **Statistical Testing Approach**

Given you're comparing failure mode distributions (categorical data), use:

**For Pairwise Comparisons:**
- **Chi-square test of independence** or **Fisher's exact test** (if cell counts < 5) to compare failure mode distributions between intervention types
- **McNemar's test** if you're using paired samples (same tasks across conditions)

**For Multiple Comparisons:**
- **Bonferroni correction** or **Holm-Bonferroni** to control family-wise error rate when comparing your protocol intervention against multiple baselines
- Set α = 0.05 initially, then adjust (e.g., α/3 = 0.0167 for three pairwise comparisons)

**For Effect Size:**
- **Cramér's V** to quantify the strength of association between intervention type and failure mode
- **Cohen's h** for comparing proportions of specific failure types

**For Success Rate Comparisons:**
- **Proportion z-test** or **binomial test** for comparing task success rates
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** if using paired samples with non-normal distributions

### 5. **Avoiding Data Leakage and Ensuring Validity**

**Critical Safeguards:**

1. **Separate development and evaluation sets**: 
   - Develop your protocol using one set of tasks
   - Evaluate on a held-out test set that wasn't used during protocol design
   
2. **Blind evaluation**:
   - Have the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluate outputs without knowing which intervention was applied
   - Randomize the order of outputs presented to the judge

3. **Protocol generalization**:
   - Test on task types not seen during protocol development
   - Verify the protocol doesn't overfit to specific failure patterns in your development set

4. **Consistent failure taxonomy**:
   - Use the exact same taxonomy and annotation guidelines from the MST paper
   - Don't modify failure categories based on your intervention results

5. **Multiple runs**:
   - Run each condition multiple times (minimum 3-5 runs) with different random seeds
   - Report mean and confidence intervals

### 6. **Concrete Experimental Protocol**

```
For each intervention type (none, prompt, topological, protocol):
  For each task in test set:
    For each run (n=5):
      1. Execute multi-agent system
      2. Collect outputs and interaction logs
      3. Apply LLM-as-a-Judge to classify failures
      4. Record success/failure and failure mode
      
Aggregate results:
  - Compute failure mode distribution per intervention
  - Calculate success rates with 95% CI
  - Perform chi-square tests between distributions
  - Calculate Cramér's V for effect sizes
  - Apply Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
```

### 7. **Expected Outcomes and Interpretation**

**Hypotheses to test:**
- H1: Communication protocol reduces Inter-Agent Misalignment more than prompt-based interventions
- H2: Communication protocol is comparable to or better than topological interventions for Inter-Agent Misalignment
- H3: Communication protocol may increase other failure types (e.g., overhead-related failures)

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- **Protocol overhead**: May increase latency or token usage, potentially introducing new failure modes
- **Compliance issues**: Agents may fail to follow the protocol despite instructions
- **Task dependency**: Protocol effectiveness may vary significantly by task type
- **Interaction effects**: Protocol may work differently when combined with certain topologies

### 8. **Reporting Standards**

Include in your results:
- Contingency tables showing failure mode counts per intervention
- Chi-square statistics with p-values and effect sizes
- Success rate comparisons with confidence intervals
- Qualitative analysis of failure cases where protocol helped/hurt
- Protocol compliance metrics

## Key Takeaways

1. **Use all three baselines** (no intervention, prompt-based, topological) from Appendix F for comprehensive comparison
2. **Apply chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction** for comparing categorical failure distributions
3. **Strictly separate** protocol development data from evaluation data to avoid leakage
4. **Monitor for new failure modes** your protocol might introduce (e.g., protocol violation failures)
5. **Report effect sizes** (Cramér's V) alongside p-values for practical significance

The statistical approaches recommended here are standard for comparing categorical distributions in experimental settings.
