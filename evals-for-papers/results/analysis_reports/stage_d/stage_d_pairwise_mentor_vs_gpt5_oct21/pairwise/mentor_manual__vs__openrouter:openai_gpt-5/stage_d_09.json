      "raw": "* **System A:**\n    * **Strengths:** Clearly outlines how to adapt the Hierarchical Transformer to healthcare dialogues while maintaining comparability with the original evaluation. It provides specific architectural changes, preprocessing steps, evaluation metrics, and ethical considerations. The plan is well-structured and addresses all aspects of the prompt. It also proposes concrete, falsifiable experiments and an implementation checklist.\n    * **Weaknesses:** Some claims are marked as \"Conjecture,\" which might indicate a lack of certainty or a need for further investigation. The literature guidance is minimal, with only two references provided.\n\n* **System B:**\n    * **Strengths:** Offers a more detailed and comprehensive plan, including a wider range of architectural adaptations, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics. It provides more specific guidance on how to handle discrete latent states, concept tokens, and causal-graph guidance. The literature guidance is more extensive, with several relevant papers cited. The proposed experiments are also well-defined and falsifiable.\n    * **Weaknesses:** Some sections are less clearly organized than in System A, and the use of \"P\" followed by a number for citations is less informative than full citations. The \"Notes to keep results comparable\" section is a bit repetitive.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nSystem B is better overall due to its greater depth and breadth of detail. It provides a more thorough and actionable plan for adapting the Hierarchical Transformer to healthcare dialogues. The inclusion of more specific architectural adaptations, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics makes it a more valuable resource for the user. While System A is also good, it lacks the level of detail and comprehensive literature guidance that System B offers.\n\n**Winner: B**\n\n**Justification:** System B provides a more comprehensive and detailed plan, covering a wider range of architectural adaptations, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics. Its literature guidance is also more extensive and relevant, making it a more valuable resource for the user.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a more comprehensive and detailed plan, covering a wider range of architectural adaptations, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics.
