      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems provide excellent, detailed plans. System A's structure is slightly more organized, breaking down perturbations by domain and then detailing experiments. System B's \"Rationale anchored in the paper\" is a good starting point. Both ask relevant, probing questions implicitly through their proposed experiments. System A's explicit mention of \"Architectural levers to test\" is a slight edge in clarity.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems do a good job of adapting to the persona (Stage D, out-of-distribution domain, web_search tool). They both reference the provided PDF and align their suggestions with the paper's stated goals (hierarchical masking, sparsification, compute reporting, stability). System A's direct mapping of \"architectural levers\" to the paper's ablations is a bit more explicit.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems excel here. They propose relevant metrics, baselines, and statistical analysis plans. System A's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is very well-structured, clearly stating hypotheses, designs, variables, and expected outcomes for each. System B also proposes concrete tests but integrates them more within the overall plan. Both discuss confounds like boundary effects and distractors.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both plans are comprehensive, covering perturbations, metrics, baselines, and analysis. System A's ordering feels slightly more logical, starting with scope, then perturbations, metrics, experiments, baselines, and analysis. System B's structure is also good but perhaps a little less intuitive in its flow.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant literature anchors. System A mentions \"Lost in the Middle\" and \"BigBird,\" which are directly applicable. System B mentions \"SCROLLS\" and \"SWE-bench,\" which are also relevant for the task domains. Both correctly cite the provided PDF.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems provide actionable steps and implicitly address risks through their proposed experiments and analyses. System A's \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section makes the actionability very clear. System B's \"Three concrete, falsifiable stress tests\" serves a similar purpose. Both outline statistical analysis plans that are concrete.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere well to the guidelines, grounding their responses in the provided PDF and avoiding overclaiming. They both use the PDF citations appropriately.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a slightly more organized and detailed plan, particularly in its \"Concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section, which clearly outlines hypotheses, designs, and expected outcomes. Both systems are excellent, but System A's structure and explicitness give it a slight edge in clarity and actionability.",
