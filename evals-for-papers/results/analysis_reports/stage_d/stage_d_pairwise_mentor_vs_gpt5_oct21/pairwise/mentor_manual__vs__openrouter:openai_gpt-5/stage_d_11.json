      "raw": "- **System A:** System A provides a more comprehensive and well-structured user study plan. It clearly delineates study goals, hypotheses, materials, participants, instruments, procedures, and a detailed analysis plan. The inclusion of specific metrics, statistical tests, and robustness checks demonstrates a strong understanding of experimental design. The persona adaptation is excellent, directly addressing the user's request for a user study to validate human perception of hierarchical representations. The methodology critique is implicitly handled by proposing baselines and ablation studies. The plan is complete and logically ordered. Literature guidance is relevant and well-integrated. Actionability and risks are addressed through the detailed plan and quality/ethics section. Guideline adherence is strong, with appropriate citations and a focus on falsifiable experiments.\n\n- **System B:** System B's response is also good, but it's less detailed and structured than System A. It introduces \"Conjecture\" for many aspects, which, while acknowledging uncertainty, can make the plan feel less concrete. The participant numbers and power calculations are less clearly explained compared to System A. The methodology critique is present through the proposed ablations, but the overall plan feels less fleshed out. The literature guidance is present but less integrated into the study design itself. Actionability is present but less detailed. Guideline adherence is decent, but the frequent use of \"Conjecture\" might indicate a less confident or complete plan.\n\n**Key Differences:**\nSystem A offers a more detailed, structured, and actionable user study plan with clearer justifications for sample sizes and statistical analyses. System B, while covering similar ground, uses \"Conjecture\" more frequently and provides less depth in its experimental design and analysis sections.\n\n**Winner:** System A\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more detailed, structured, and actionable user study plan with clearer justifications for sample sizes and statistical analyses.
