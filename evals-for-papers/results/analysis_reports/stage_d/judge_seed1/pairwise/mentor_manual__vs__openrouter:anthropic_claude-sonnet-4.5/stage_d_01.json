      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality:**\n    * System A: The response is empty, so it cannot be evaluated.\n    * System B: The response directly addresses the user's prompt by breaking down the methodology, identifying key components, and highlighting potential pitfalls. It also proposes concrete experiments and next steps, demonstrating a good understanding of the user's needs.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation:**\n    * System A: The response is empty and therefore fails to adapt to the persona.\n    * System B: The response adopts a helpful and knowledgeable tone, suitable for a research mentor. It uses technical terms appropriately and provides structured guidance, aligning with the user's stage (D) and domain (sea_ice, though the paper is about LLM evaluation, the user is applying it to their framework).\n\n3. **Methodology Critique:**\n    * System A: No response.\n    * System B: System B excels here. It explicitly discusses data leakage, iterative refinement, LLM prompt design, and validation metrics. It also proposes experiments to *validate* the reproduction, which is a form of critique and validation of the methodology itself. The proposed experiments (Data Leakage Sensitivity Test, Taxonomy Stability Across Frameworks, Ablation of Iterative Refinement) are excellent critiques of potential weaknesses in the user's replication.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n    * System A: No response.\n    * System B: System B provides a very complete plan. It breaks down the key components, suggests concrete experiments with setup, metrics, and expected outcomes, offers a practical implementation checklist, poses critical questions for the user to consider, and outlines clear next actions. The ordering is logical, moving from understanding the core methodology to validating the reproduction and then to practical implementation.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality:**\n    * System A: No response.\n    * System B: System B provides two relevant literature anchors. Zheng et al. (2023) is directly related to LLM-as-a-Judge validation, and Artstein & Poesio (2008) is a foundational text for inter-coder agreement metrics like Cohen's kappa, which is central to the paper's methodology. The references are appropriate and useful.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks:**\n    * System A: No response.\n    * System B: System B is highly actionable. It provides a \"Practical Implementation Checklist\" and \"Next Actions (1-3 days)\" that give the user concrete steps to take. It also explicitly identifies pitfalls throughout the explanation (e.g., \"Critical pitfall: Never let traces from your development set appear in validation,\" \"Pitfall: Don't stop refinement too early\").\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence:**\n    * System A: No response.\n    * System B: System B adheres well to guidelines. It avoids overclaiming by framing its understanding based on \"paper snippets\" and \"visible\" elements. It grounds its advice in the paper's methodology (Section 3.4, Figure 2) and provides verifiable claims (e.g., Cohen's kappa ranges). It does not hallucinate citations.\n\n### **Justification**\nSystem A provided no response. System B provided a comprehensive, well-structured, and actionable response that directly addressed the user's prompt. It accurately identified key components and pitfalls of the LLM-as-a-Judge pipeline, proposed insightful experiments for validating the reproduction, and offered practical guidance and next steps, demonstrating excellent adherence to the persona and task.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provided no response.
