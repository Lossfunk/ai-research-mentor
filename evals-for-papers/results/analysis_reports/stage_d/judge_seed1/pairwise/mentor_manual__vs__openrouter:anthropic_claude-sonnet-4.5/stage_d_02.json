      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems understand the user's request to design an experiment for a new intervention type (standardized communication protocol) and identify appropriate baselines and statistical tests. System B is slightly more detailed in its proposed protocol components and experimental designs.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems correctly identify the user's stage (D) and the constraint (small_n). They both offer relevant guidance. System A's structure is more straightforward and easier to follow for someone at stage D. System B's response is more advanced, assuming a deeper understanding of experimental design and statistical methods, which might be overwhelming for a stage D researcher.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A provides a good overview of potential metrics and statistical tests. System B goes into much greater depth, suggesting more advanced statistical techniques (e.g., multinomial regression, bootstrap confidence intervals for divergence metrics, cluster-robust SEs, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) and proposing specific ablations and dose-response experiments. System B's critique is more thorough and insightful.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a well-ordered plan covering baselines, intervention design, setup, statistics, validity, a concrete protocol, and expected outcomes. System B also covers these aspects but structures its response differently, with a \"Short answer\" followed by detailed sections. System B's inclusion of specific, falsifiable experiments and ablations makes its plan more comprehensive and robust.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A provides a link to the MST paper and a GitHub repository, which are relevant. System B cites two statistical texts, which are appropriate for the statistical tests it recommends. Neither system directly references Appendix F of the MST paper, as acknowledged by System A. System B's citations are more directly tied to the statistical methods it proposes.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A clearly outlines concrete next steps and potential pitfalls. System B also identifies risks and proposes controls and ablations, making its plan highly actionable and robust. System B's detailed experimental designs (e.g., SCP-Handshake + Commit vs. baselines) are very concrete.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to the guidelines. System A is more cautious in its claims, while System B is more assertive and detailed, which is appropriate given its more advanced statistical recommendations.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a more in-depth and sophisticated experimental design, including specific protocol components, detailed statistical analyses with advanced techniques, and concrete, falsifiable experiments with ablations. While System A offers a solid, well-structured response, System B's depth and breadth of suggestions are more valuable for a researcher looking to design a rigorous experiment, especially concerning the statistical rigor and the exploration of the proposed intervention. System B's focus on ablations and dose-response experiments demonstrates a deeper understanding of experimental design principles.\n\n**Reasoning for aspect votes**:\n- **Inquiry Quality**: Tie (Both understood the prompt well, B was slightly more detailed)\n- **Persona Adaptation**: A (System A's structure is more accessible for a Stage D researcher, while B's depth might be overwhelming)\n- **Methodology Critique**: B (System B offers much more detailed and advanced statistical and experimental design critiques)\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: B (System B's inclusion of specific experiments, ablations, and dose-response studies makes its plan more comprehensive)\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: Tie (Both provided relevant, but not perfect, guidance. B's statistical citations are more directly applicable to its recommendations)\n- **Actionability & Risks**: B (System B's detailed experimental designs and proposed controls are highly actionable)\n- **Guideline Adherence**: Tie (Both followed guidelines well)\n\n**Final Decision**: B is the winner due to its superior depth in methodology critique, plan completeness, and actionability, despite A being slightly better adapted to the persona's stage. The core of the request is experimental design, where B excels.```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a more comprehensive and sophisticated experimental design, including detailed statistical analyses, specific ablations, and concrete, falsifiable experiments.
