      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A asks clarifying questions about budget and annotation capacity, which is good for a real mentoring session. System B is more direct in its plan. Both systems understand the core request. System A's questions are more aligned with the persona's stage (D - needs guidance).\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: System A is better adapted to the persona's stage (D). It provides a more structured and detailed plan, including concrete experiments, implementation checklists, and key questions for the mentee. System B is more concise but less guiding.\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems propose reasonable ablations and metrics. System A's proposed conditions (Full, No Explicit Verifier, Passive Verifier) are very clear and directly address the core question. System B's ablations are more numerous and perhaps overly complex for a \"minimal set\" (e.g., Toolless Verifier, Always-Approve Verifier). System A's failure mode tracking is also more detailed and actionable.\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a much more complete plan, including detailed experimental setups, expected outcomes, interpretations, and follow-ups for each experiment. It also includes an implementation checklist and key questions. System B is less comprehensive.\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems cite relevant papers. System A cites the MST paper and AblationBench. System B cites the MST paper and two other papers on verification. System A's citations feel more directly integrated into the plan (e.g., referencing specific failure modes from the MST paper). System B's citations are good but less integrated into the experimental design.\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A is significantly more actionable. It breaks down the plan into concrete experiments, provides implementation checklists, and explicitly asks clarifying questions to tailor the plan further. System B is less actionable due to its conciseness and less detailed experimental design.\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to guidelines. System A's use of \"[file:5]\" is a bit unusual but likely refers to a specific document provided in the context. Both avoid overclaiming.\n\n**Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a significantly more comprehensive, actionable, and well-structured plan that is better suited for a mentee at stage D. It breaks down the ablation study into clear experiments, details metrics and failure modes effectively, and includes practical implementation steps and clarifying questions, making it a much more valuable guide. System B is concise but lacks the depth and guidance needed for this stage.\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a significantly more comprehensive, actionable, and well-structured plan that is better suited for a mentee at stage D.
