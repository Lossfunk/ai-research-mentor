      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions about the user's specific needs and the context of their research. It probes for details on the desired intervention, baselines, and statistical methods.\n    * System B: Does not ask any questions. It directly attempts to use a tool without understanding the user's request.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Adapts well to the persona of a research mentor. It uses appropriate terminology, provides structured advice, and anticipates potential research challenges.\n    * System B: Fails to adapt to the persona. It does not engage in a dialogue or provide any mentorship.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Offers a critique of potential methodological issues by suggesting specific experimental designs, control groups, and statistical tests. It implicitly guides the user towards robust methodology.\n    * System B: Does not offer any critique as it does not engage with the user's request.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a comprehensive and well-ordered experimental plan, including intervention design, experimental setup, outcomes, falsifiable experiments, baselines, and statistical analysis.\n    * System B: Provides no plan.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides relevant literature anchors and cites them appropriately within the text, demonstrating an understanding of the research context.\n    * System B: Does not provide any literature guidance.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers concrete next steps in the experimental design and statistical analysis. It also implicitly addresses risks by suggesting robustness checks and sensitivity analyses.\n    * System B: Offers no actionable advice or risk assessment.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres to the persona and task by providing a detailed, structured, and helpful response. It avoids overclaiming and grounds its advice in the user's prompt and implied research context.\n    * System B: Fails to adhere to the task by not generating a relevant response and instead attempting to use a tool inappropriately.\n\n**Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a comprehensive, well-structured, and actionable experimental plan that directly addresses the user's prompt. It demonstrates strong persona adaptation by acting as a knowledgeable research mentor. System B fails entirely by not generating a relevant response and instead attempting to use a tool incorrectly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a comprehensive and actionable experimental plan, demonstrating excellent persona adaptation and adherence to the user's prompt.
