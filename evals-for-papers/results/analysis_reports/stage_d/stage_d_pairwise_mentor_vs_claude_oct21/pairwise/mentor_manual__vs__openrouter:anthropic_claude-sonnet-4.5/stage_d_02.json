      "raw": "- **inquiry_quality**: A\n- **persona_adaptation**: A\n- **methodology_critique**: A\n- **plan_completeness**: A\n- **literature_quality**: A\n- **actionability_risks**: A\n- **guideline_adherence**: A\n\n- **winner**: A\n- **justification**: System A is better because it more directly addresses the user's prompt by focusing on replacing hierarchical pooling with flat mean pooling. It provides a clearer breakdown of model variants and experiments directly related to this intervention. System B, while thorough, seems to misinterpret the core request, focusing more on hierarchical masking in general rather than the specific pooling replacement. System A's experimental design is more tightly coupled to the user's stated goal.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation\n\n**1. Inquiry Quality:**\n- **System A:** Asks clarifying questions about the specific pooling mechanism and its scope, which is good. It also proposes concrete variants and experiments directly addressing the prompt.\n- **System B:** Interprets the prompt as replacing \"hierarchical masking\" with \"flat mean pooling,\" which is a slight deviation from the user's explicit request to replace \"hierarchical pooling.\" However, it does propose a control that involves mean pooling.\n- **Vote:** A (System A is more precise in its interpretation and questioning regarding the core intervention.)\n\n**2. Persona Adaptation:**\n- **System A:** Adheres well to the persona's stage (D) and constraint (architecture ablation). It uses the provided PDF citations appropriately and grounds its suggestions in the context of the paper.\n- **System B:** Also adheres to the persona's stage and constraint. It uses citations effectively and grounds its suggestions.\n- **Vote:** Tie (Both systems adapt well to the persona and constraints.)\n\n**3. Methodology Critique:**\n- **System A:** Critiques potential confounds (capacity differences) and suggests controls (capacity-matched variants, optional projection control). It also proposes relevant baselines and secondary metrics to isolate the effect of pooling.\n- **System B:** Critiques potential confounds like implementation quality, hyperparameter tuning, capacity mismatch, and SPARTAN interaction. It proposes several baselines, some of which are external, which is good for context but less direct for the specific ablation.\n- **Vote:** A (System A's critique is more directly focused on the methodological implications of the *specific* intervention requested, e.g., capacity matching for pooling variants.)\n\n**4. Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n- **System A:** Provides a comprehensive plan covering intervention details, model variants, datasets, metrics (primary/secondary), controls, statistical tests, and concrete experiments. The ordering is logical.\n- **System B:** Also provides a very comprehensive plan, including baselines, datasets, metrics, statistical testing, implementation checklist, expected outcomes, confounds, and timeline. The ordering is logical.\n- **Vote:** A (System A's plan feels slightly more focused on the core intervention. For example, its model variants are more directly tied to testing the pooling mechanism itself, whereas System B includes broader baselines like IRIS and Sparse Imagination which are less direct ablations of the *pooling* aspect.)\n\n**5. Literature Guidance Quality:**\n- **System A:** Uses the provided PDF citations effectively and correctly. It also references relevant external work (Hafner et al.) for context on datasets.\n- **System B:** Uses the provided PDF citations effectively. It also references external work (Micheli et al., Chun et al., Agarwal et al., Colas et al.) which is good, but some of these references are for external baselines rather than directly supporting the *intervention design* itself.\n- **Vote:** A (System A's literature guidance is more tightly focused on supporting the specific ablation requested, using the provided paper's citations precisely.)\n\n**6. Actionability & Risks:**\n- **System A:** Clearly outlines concrete next steps through its \"Three (plus) concrete, falsifiable experiments.\" It also implicitly addresses risks by proposing controls and capacity matching.\n- **System B:** Provides a detailed \"Implementation Checklist\" and \"Potential Confounds & Mitigations,\" which are highly actionable and address risks explicitly. The timeline is also very concrete.\n- **Vote:** A (While both are actionable, System A's \"concrete experiments\" section directly translates the plan into actionable research steps that are easier to grasp and execute.)\n\n**7. Guideline Adherence:**\n- **System A:** Follows the guidelines well, avoiding overclaiming and grounding its suggestions in the provided context. It correctly uses the citations.\n- **System B:** Also follows the guidelines well, avoiding overclaiming and grounding its suggestions. It correctly uses the citations.\n- **Vote:** A (System A is slightly better at adhering to the *spirit* of the prompt by focusing precisely on the requested intervention,",
