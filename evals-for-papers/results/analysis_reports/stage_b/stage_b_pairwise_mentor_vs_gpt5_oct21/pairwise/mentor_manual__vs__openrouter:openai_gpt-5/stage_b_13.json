      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both A and B ask excellent clarifying questions and provide detailed, actionable advice. They both demonstrate a strong understanding of the user's prompt and the constraints. However, System A's framing of \"Where novelty likely lies\" and \"Baselines you should compare against\" feels slightly more direct and easier to digest for someone exploring a new research area. System B's \"Where innovation is likely\" is also good, but the subsequent \"Design and measurement principles to adopt\" and \"Why this is new enough\" sections, while valuable, are a bit more academic in tone.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona (Stage B researcher, low-resource, agri_xai). They both acknowledge the \"low-resource\" constraint and tailor their suggestions accordingly (SMS, intermittent connectivity, literacy). System A's tone is slightly more encouraging and direct, which might be more beneficial for a researcher at Stage B who is exploring the \"room for real innovation.\" System B is also good but leans a bit more towards a literature review summary.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems offer strong critiques and suggestions for experimental design. System A's \"At least three concrete, falsifiable experiments\" are well-structured with clear designs, outcomes, and falsifiable outcomes. System B's experiments are also good, but the \"Notes\" section in experiment 1 feels a bit like an afterthought. System A's explicit mention of \"Baselines you should compare against\" is a very strong point for methodology.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide a comprehensive plan, covering potential areas of innovation, experimental designs, and risks. System A's ordering feels more logical, starting with novelty, then baselines, then experiments, and finally risks. System B's structure is also good, but the \"Design and measurement principles to adopt\" and \"Why this is new enough\" sections, while important, could be integrated more smoothly into the overall plan.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant citations. System A's citations seem to be more directly tied to the agricultural context and the specific challenges of SMS advisories. System B's citations include more general XAI papers (e.g., counterfactual generation surveys) which, while relevant, might be less immediately actionable for someone focused on the agri_xai domain. System A's citations [4] and [5] specifically address SMS advisories in agriculture, which is a direct hit.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems offer actionable advice and discuss risks. System A's \"Feasibility and risks\" section is very clear and directly addresses potential challenges like data, safety, UX, and measurement. System B also covers risks implicitly within its experimental designs and principles. System A's \"Bottom line\" provides a very concise and actionable summary.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and present information grounded in the provided context. System A's citations are more consistently integrated into the narrative, making it easier to follow the flow of evidence.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more direct, actionable, and contextually grounded response. Its structure, from identifying novelty to suggesting baselines and experiments, is highly logical for a researcher exploring a new area. The literature guidance is also more specifically tailored to the agricultural SMS domain, and the \"Feasibility and risks\" section is particularly well-articulated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A offers a more direct, actionable, and contextually grounded response.
