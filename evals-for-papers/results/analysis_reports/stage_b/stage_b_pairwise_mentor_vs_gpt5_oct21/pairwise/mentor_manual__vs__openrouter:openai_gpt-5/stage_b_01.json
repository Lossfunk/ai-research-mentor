      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems accurately assess the novelty of the user's proposed research direction. They both identify that GNNs have been applied to sea ice forecasting but that there are still avenues for novel contributions. System A's breakdown of \"What's been done\" and \"Where novelty likely remains\" is slightly more structured and comprehensive. System B's \"What can still be novel\" is also good but less detailed.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona. They understand the user is exploring a research idea and provide guidance on novelty, potential research directions, and experimental design. System A's inclusion of specific, falsifiable experiments with detailed hypotheses, data, models, and metrics is particularly strong. System B also provides experiments, but they are slightly less detailed in their setup.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A excels here by explicitly mentioning potential confounds (e.g., static vs. dynamic graphs, physics-informed losses) and suggesting specific metrics and evaluation strategies (e.g., WeatherBench2, IIEE, reliability analysis). System B also touches on these but less explicitly.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a more complete and well-ordered plan. The \"Three concrete, falsifiable experiments\" section is very well-structured, and the \"Next steps\" section offers clear, actionable guidance. System B's experiments are good, but the \"Data and baselines to use\" and \"Anchors to read first\" sections feel a bit less integrated into a cohesive plan compared to System A's \"Next steps.\"\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant literature. System A's citations are well-integrated into the text, explaining *why* each paper is relevant to specific points. System B also cites relevant work, but System A's integration feels more natural and informative. System A's inclusion of WeatherBench2 as a methodological benchmark is a particularly good piece of guidance.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"Three concrete, falsifiable experiments\" and \"Next steps\" are highly actionable. The hypotheses are clear, and the expected outcomes are framed in a way that makes the results informative regardless of whether they support the hypothesis. System B's experiments are also actionable, but System A's framing of \"Expected outcome\" for each experiment is more explicit about what constitutes a \"win\" or \"loss\" and what insights can be gained.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and present information grounded in the provided context. System A's detailed experimental design and clear articulation of falsifiable hypotheses demonstrate a strong understanding of scientific rigor.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more detailed, structured, and actionable response. Its breakdown of novelty, its concrete experimental designs with clear hypotheses and expected outcomes, and its well-defined next steps make it a superior guide for the user's research exploration. System B is good, but less comprehensive and detailed in its experimental proposals and overall plan.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more detailed and structured response, offering concrete, falsifiable experiments with clear hypotheses and expected outcomes.
