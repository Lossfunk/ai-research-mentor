      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks one clarifying question at the end.\n    * System B: Asks five clarifying questions at the beginning.\n    * **Winner: B** - System B's questions are more comprehensive and directly address the persona's constraints and potential challenges.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the \"never coded\" constraint by outlining learning paths and time estimates. It acknowledges the persona's stage and potential skills gap.\n    * System B: Acknowledges the \"never coded\" constraint and the \"skills gap\" by asking clarifying questions about the user's background and support system. It frames the problem in terms of learning curves and bottlenecks.\n    * **Tie** - Both systems adapt well, but System B's approach of gathering more information first is more aligned with a mentoring role.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Does not critique methodology as the user hasn't proposed one.\n    * System B: Briefly critiques the potential approach by highlighting the \"steep double learning curve\" and the risk of \"spending months on tooling before you can test a single hypothesis.\" It also mentions the principle of getting signal quickly.\n    * **Winner: B** - System B offers a more insightful critique of the *potential* approach given the user's constraints.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a detailed \"Learn First, Research Later\" plan with monthly breakdowns and concrete first steps. It also offers alternative paths (collaboration, hybrid).\n    * System B: Outlines three high-level paths (Collaboration-first, Structured learning sprint, Tool-assisted shortcut) and promises a concrete 2-week \"Phase 0\" plan after receiving answers to its questions.\n    * **Winner: A** - System A provides a more complete and actionable plan upfront, even if it's based on assumptions. System B's plan is contingent on further input.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Mentions specific courses (Coursera, Fast.ai, Stanford CS224W) and libraries (PyTorch Geometric, DGL, NumPy, pandas, xarray).\n    * System B: Mentions PyTorch Geometric, DGL, Colab, and general concepts like \"coding bootcamp\" and \"published baseline.\"\n    * **Winner: A** - System A provides more specific and actionable resources for learning.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers concrete first steps for both solo and collaborative paths. It lists \"Red Flags to Avoid\" and \"Green Flags for Success,\" which implicitly highlight risks and mitigations.\n    * System B: Promises a concrete plan after receiving answers. It highlights the risk of \"spending months on tooling\" and suggests paths that mitigate this.\n    * **Winner: A** - System A's actionability is higher because it provides immediate steps. Its \"Red Flags\" section is a good way to communicate risks.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Avoids overclaiming by stating the project is \"feasible, but challenging\" and providing realistic time estimates. It doesn't cite external sources.\n    * System B: Avoids overclaiming by stating it needs more context. It mentions \"research mentorship guidelines\" but doesn't cite them.\n    * **Tie** - Both systems adhere well to guidelines.\n\n### Final Winner: A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more comprehensive and immediately actionable response. While System B's inquiry-driven approach is good mentoring practice, System A directly addresses the user's core question (\"feasible?\") with a detailed breakdown of what's required, realistic timelines, and concrete learning paths. System A's \"Red Flags\" and \"Green Flags\" also offer valuable, immediate guidance on potential pitfalls and success factors.\n\n**Note**: System B's approach of asking clarifying questions first is a valid mentoring strategy, but for this specific prompt, System A's directness and detailed plan are more helpful as an initial response. If this were an ongoing conversation, System B's approach might be preferred.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more comprehensive and immediately actionable response by outlining detailed learning paths, realistic timelines, and concrete first steps.
