      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks good follow-up questions to help the user refine their ideas.\n    * System B: Does not ask follow-up questions, but instead provides a very detailed plan.\n    * **Tie**.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Provides a good overview of existing work and potential novelty angles, and suggests concrete next steps.\n    * System B: Provides a much more detailed and actionable plan, including specific experiments and hypotheses. It also identifies strong baselines and potential pitfalls.\n    * **B**.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Briefly touches on novelty angles related to methodology (e.g., graph constructions, hybrid approaches).\n    * System B: Critiques existing work by highlighting limitations (e.g., static graphs, lack of probabilistic GNNs) and proposes specific experimental designs with clear hypotheses, metrics, and expected outcomes.\n    * **B**.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a high-level plan with three steps.\n    * System B: Provides a comprehensive and well-ordered plan, including specific experiments, baselines, metrics, and next steps.\n    * **B**.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Cites relevant papers and categorizes them appropriately.\n    * System B: Cites more papers, categorizes them well, and integrates them directly into the proposed experiments and novelty angles. It also explicitly mentions strong baselines like IceNet.\n    * **B**.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers concrete next steps and asks a follow-up question.\n    * System B: Provides highly actionable steps, including three detailed experimental proposals with falsifiable hypotheses, metrics, and expected outcomes. It also explicitly mentions risks by suggesting strong baselines and areas not well covered.\n    * **B**.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows guidelines well.\n    * System B: Follows guidelines well, providing a detailed and well-supported response.\n    * **Tie**.\n\n**Overall Winner**: B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a significantly more detailed, actionable, and methodologically sound response. It not only identifies potential novelty angles but also proposes concrete, falsifiable experiments with clear hypotheses, metrics, and baselines, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the research process and the domain.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a much more detailed and actionable plan, including specific experimental designs with hypotheses and metrics.
