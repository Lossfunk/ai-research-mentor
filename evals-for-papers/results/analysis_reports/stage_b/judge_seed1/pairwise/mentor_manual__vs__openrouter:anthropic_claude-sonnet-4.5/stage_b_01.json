      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks a direct question about refining a novel angle or identifying gaps.\n    * System B: Asks four strategic questions to better understand the user's specific angle, data, and goals.\n    * **Winner**: B. System B's questions are more comprehensive and probing, aiming to gather more information to provide tailored advice.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly answers the novelty question and provides potential novelty angles.\n    * System B: Also answers the novelty question but frames it within the context of principled research and asks clarifying questions. It also provides a \"Problem selection rubric\" which is a nice touch for a researcher.\n    * **Winner**: B. System B's response feels more like a mentor guiding a researcher, emphasizing the \"why\" and \"how\" of good research, not just the \"what.\"\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Briefly mentions novelty angles like \"novel graph constructions\" and \"hybrid approaches.\"\n    * System B: Goes into much greater detail, suggesting specific experiments with objectives, hypotheses, setup, metrics, and interpretation. It also critiques the potential for incremental work (\"Simply showing 'GNNs work on sea ice too' is incremental\").\n    * **Winner**: B. System B provides a much more thorough and actionable critique by outlining concrete experimental designs.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a short list of \"Next Steps\" that are logical but brief.\n    * System B: Offers a more detailed \"Immediate next steps\" section and then outlines \"Three Concrete Experiments,\" which is a very complete plan. The ordering is logical, starting with literature review and moving to specific experiments.\n    * **Winner**: B. System B's plan is significantly more detailed and comprehensive.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Cites specific papers directly related to GNNs and sea ice, and also related ice applications. The citations are relevant and appear to be recent.\n    * System B: Cites GNNs for weather forecasting broadly, and then mentions specific papers like \"Forecasting Global Weather with Graph Neural Networks\" and \"HiSTGNN.\" It also includes a cautionary tale paper and general ML research guides.\n    * **Winner**: A. System A's citations are more directly relevant to the user's specific domain (sea ice), whereas System B's initial citations are broader (weather forecasting). While System B's additional citations are useful, System A's core citations are more on-point.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers concrete next steps and asks a follow-up question.\n    * System B: Provides very actionable next steps and detailed experimental plans. It implicitly addresses risks by framing the research problem and suggesting ways to ensure impact beyond incremental work.\n    * **Winner**: B. System B's detailed experimental plans and strategic questions make its advice far more actionable.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines, directly answering the question and providing relevant citations.\n    * System B: Also adheres well. It avoids overclaiming and grounds its advice in research principles.\n    * **Winner**: Tie. Both systems follow the guidelines well.\n\n### Final Winner: B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a more comprehensive and insightful response. It not only answers the novelty question but also guides the user on how to approach the research problem in a principled way, offering detailed experimental designs and strategic questions to refine the user's focus. While System A's literature search is more directly on-topic for sea ice, System B's overall mentorship quality and actionable plan are superior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a more comprehensive and insightful response by guiding the user on principled research, offering detailed experimental designs, and asking strategic questions.
