      "raw": "- **inquiry_quality**: A - System A asks more direct and actionable questions that help the user refine their idea. System B's questions are also good but slightly more scattered.\n- **persona_adaptation**: A - System A's tone is more direct and encouraging, aligning better with a mentor guiding a student. System B is a bit more verbose and less focused.\n- **methodology_critique**: A - System A provides a more concise and principled critique of why GANs might not be suitable for analysis tasks, referencing the literature more effectively.\n- **plan_completeness**: A - System A's \"Next Actions\" are more concrete and time-bound, providing a clearer path forward.\n- **literature_quality**: Tie - Both systems cite relevant literature, but System A's citations feel slightly more integrated into the explanation.\n- **actionability_risks**: A - System A's \"Next Actions\" are more actionable and clearly linked to assessing originality and feasibility. System B's \"Tests You Should Run\" are good but less framed as immediate next steps.\n- **guideline_adherence**: A - System A adheres better to the persona's implied need for clear, actionable guidance.\n\n## Justification\nSystem A is better because it provides a more direct, actionable, and principled response. Its critical questions and next steps are clearer and more focused, helping the user refine their vague idea into a concrete research question. System B is also good but slightly more verbose and less structured in its guidance.\n\n## Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more direct, actionable, and principled response.
