      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems directly address the user's question about novelty. System A is slightly more direct in its \"Partly novel\" answer and then elaborates. System B also answers directly and then provides more detail. Both are good.\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems understand the persona's stage (B) and domain (sea ice). They both correctly identify that graph nets are not entirely novel but have room for exploration. System A's structure feels a bit more like a mentor guiding a student through potential research avenues.\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A offers more specific critiques and suggestions for novelty within the methodology (dynamic graph topology, multiscale graphs, probabilistic GNNs, multi-task targets, physics-aware losses). System B also covers these but perhaps with slightly less detail in the \"novelty available\" section.\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide concrete, falsifiable experiments. System A provides three well-structured experiments, each with a hypothesis, setup, metrics, and expected outcome. System B provides five experiments, which are also well-structured but perhaps slightly less detailed in their setup descriptions compared to A. System A's \"What to do first\" section is a good addition for actionable next steps.\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems cite relevant papers. System A's citations are more integrated into the text, explaining *why* each paper is relevant to a specific point. System B also cites relevant papers, but the connection is sometimes less explicit. System A's literature anchors are also more descriptive.\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"What to do first\" section is highly actionable. It also implicitly highlights risks by suggesting baselines and areas to focus on for novelty. System B's experiments are actionable, and the falsifiable criteria directly address risks and how to reject claims.\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems seem to adhere to guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and present information grounded in the cited literature.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more structured and detailed response, particularly in its \"Where your work can be novel\" section and its three concrete experiments. The \"What to do first\" section offers excellent actionable advice. While System B is also good and offers more experiments, System A's depth and clarity in guiding the user toward specific research avenues make it the superior response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more structured and detailed response, particularly in its 'Where your work can be novel' section and its three concrete experiments.
