      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: The system attempted to use a tool but failed due to invalid arguments. This indicates a lack of understanding of how to properly use the tool or a failure in the tool execution itself.\n    * System B: The system directly answered the prompt, providing a comprehensive and well-structured response. It understood the user's need for specific ablations and error analyses related to hand-engineered features in the context of paper acceptance classification.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Failed to provide any response due to tool error.\n    * System B: Successfully adapted to the persona by providing a detailed, expert-level response. It anticipated reviewer expectations and framed the suggestions within the context of rigorous scientific evaluation, which is appropriate for a researcher at stage E.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: No response provided.\n    * System B: Systematically addressed methodology critique by suggesting specific ablations (feature group, individual feature, baseline comparison) and error analyses (stratified, qualitative, cross-venue generalization). It explained the rationale behind each suggestion, linking them to potential reviewer concerns and scientific rigor.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: No response provided.\n    * System B: Provided a complete plan, covering various types of ablations and error analyses. The suggestions were logically ordered, with a clear summary of priorities, guiding the user on which experiments to conduct first.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: No response provided.\n    * System B: Effectively used citations from the provided `PeerRead.pdf` to ground its suggestions, demonstrating an understanding of the relevant literature and its application to the task. The references were relevant and supported the proposed analyses.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: No response provided.\n    * System B: Provided highly actionable suggestions. Each proposed experiment included objectives, hypotheses, setup steps, evaluation metrics, success criteria, interpretation guidance, and follow-up actions. It also implicitly highlighted risks by explaining what certain outcomes would imply (e.g., if paper features add little value, consider dropping them).\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Failed to adhere to guidelines due to tool error.\n    * System B: Adhered to guidelines by providing a substantive, well-reasoned response without making unsubstantiated claims. It focused on methodological rigor and anticipated reviewer expectations, which aligns with the goal of producing high-quality research.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A failed to provide a response due to a tool error.
