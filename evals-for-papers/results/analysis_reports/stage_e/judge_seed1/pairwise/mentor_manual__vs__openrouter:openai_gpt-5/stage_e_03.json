They are comparable in this regard.\n*   **Persona Adaptation:** Both systems understand the persona and task. They both adopt a helpful, expert tone and provide relevant information.\n*   **Methodology Critique:** System B is stronger here. While System A identifies valid threats, System B's critique is more nuanced and specific to the PeerRead dataset's known issues (e.g., arXiv heuristics, leakage from specific fields). System B also proposes more sophisticated analyses to address these issues, such as PU learning and propensity-score reweighting.\n*   **Plan Completeness & Ordering:** System B offers a more complete and well-ordered plan. Its proposed analyses are more detailed, and it includes concrete outcome criteria for each analysis, making the plan more actionable and falsifiable. System A's plan is good but less detailed in its execution and evaluation criteria.\n*   **Literature Guidance Quality:** System B's literature guidance is superior. It cites the PeerRead paper [1] and then uses additional citations [2, 3] to support its claims about specific issues (like arXiv labels, leakage, and deduplication) and proposed solutions. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the relevant literature and how it applies to the problem. System A primarily relies on [P1] and offers a more general suggestion for comparative anchors.\n*   **Actionability & Risks:** System B is more actionable. Its proposed analyses include specific methods, sampling strategies, and clear outcome criteria. It also implicitly highlights risks by proposing specific checks and mitigations (e.g., \"If removing these fields drops AUC/ρ by >5 points, standardize on leakage-free features\"). System A's suggestions are good but less concrete in their execution and evaluation.\n*   **Guideline Adherence:** Both systems adhere to guidelines. However, System B's more specific and evidence-backed suggestions (supported by multiple citations) make it slightly better in demonstrating a grounded approach.",
