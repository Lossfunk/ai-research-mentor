      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems understand the user's request to articulate the limitations of the PeerRead paper's labeling process for newer venues and propose follow-up experiments. System A's explanation of *why* the limitation affects generalizability is more detailed and nuanced, covering coverage mismatch, label-construction drift, high-variance evaluation, and heuristic negatives. System B's explanation is more concise but also effective. Both propose concrete experiments.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems adapt well to the persona of a researcher (stage E) working on PeerRead. They use appropriate technical language and focus on methodological rigor and reviewer concerns. System A's structure, with distinct sections for \"Why it hurts generalizability\" and \"Follow-up experiment,\" is very clear and directly addresses the prompt.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: Both systems offer good critiques. System A's critique is embedded within the explanation of *why* the limitation is a problem, which is effective. System B's critique is more explicit in its experimental designs, particularly in Experiment 1 (label-audit + effect on metrics) and Experiment 3 (label-source ablation). System A's proposed experiments are also methodologically sound, with clear metrics and falsifiable criteria.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both systems provide comprehensive plans. System A's plan is slightly more detailed in its experimental conditions and falsifiable criteria. System B's plan is also very thorough, breaking down experiments into hypotheses, designs, metrics, and expected outcomes. The ordering in both is logical, starting with explaining the problem and then proposing solutions.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems provide relevant literature. System A cites the PeerRead paper and a paper on domain generalization. System B cites the PeerRead paper and two papers on cross-dataset generalization and leave-domain-out evaluation, which are highly relevant to the user's specific concerns about generalizability and venue shift. System B's inline citations are also well-integrated.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: Both systems provide actionable next steps. System A's \"How to frame this in the discussion\" section is particularly helpful for translating the proposed experiments into a convincing narrative for reviewers. System B also offers guidance on presentation. Both implicitly address risks by proposing experiments that can validate or invalidate claims.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to the guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and present their suggestions as proposals for investigation. System A's citations are well-formatted. System B's use of \"[P3]\" and \"[P4]\" as placeholders for inline citations is a bit less polished than System A's direct citations, but the final citation list is clear.\n\n**Comparison**:\n\nSystem A excels in its detailed explanation of *why* the labeling limitation affects generalizability, providing a more thorough theoretical grounding. Its proposed experiments are also well-defined with clear falsifiable criteria.\n\nSystem B offers a slightly more structured approach to the experimental proposals, breaking them down into hypothesis, design, metrics, and expected outcomes, which can be very helpful for planning. Its literature guidance is also slightly more targeted to the specific nuances of cross-dataset generalization and leave-domain-out evaluation.\n\nOverall, System A feels slightly more comprehensive in its initial explanation of the problem, while System B's experimental designs are perhaps a bit more granular and directly address potential reviewer concerns with specific hypotheses and outcomes. However, System A's inclusion of \"How to frame this in the discussion\" is a significant advantage for practical application.\n\nGiven the prompt's emphasis on *articulating* the limitation and proposing a *concrete* experiment, System A's detailed explanation of the limitation and its well-defined experimental plan with falsifiable criteria give it a slight edge. The framing advice is also a strong point.\n\n**Winner**: A\n**Justification**: System A provides a more thorough explanation of *why* the labeling limitation affects generalizability and offers a more detailed experimental plan with clear falsifiable criteria. Its advice on framing the discussion is also highly practical for addressing reviewer concerns.\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more thorough explanation of the problem's impact on generalizability and offers a more detailed experimental plan with clear falsifiable criteria.
