      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A asks clarifying questions to tailor its response, while System B provides a comprehensive, albeit generic, response upfront. System A's approach is more interactive and aims to gather necessary information for a personalized checklist. System B's questions are embedded within its response, making them less direct.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: System A correctly infers the domain (pathology, MIL, transfer learning) and uses this to inform its provisional checklist and risks. System B also infers the domain and provides a detailed checklist aligned with major ML conferences, which is appropriate for a Stage F researcher.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System B offers more concrete methodological suggestions within its checklist and \"de-risk\" experiments, such as specifying baselines, metrics, and evaluation protocols for transfer learning. System A's critique is more implicit, embedded in the checklist items.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a structured checklist and identifies risks, but defers the timeline and detailed plan until it receives more information. System B provides a complete timeline, checklist, risks, and missing items upfront, which is more directly actionable as a \"submission checklist.\"\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System B provides specific literature anchors and citations relevant to MIL and computational pathology, which is more directly useful for the user's paper. System A mentions literature but doesn't provide specific references.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"Next Actions\" are clear, but it requires user input before providing a full plan. System B provides a complete set of risks and actionable \"missing items\" and \"concrete experiments\" immediately.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems seem to adhere to guidelines. System B's explicit citations for checklists and ethics policies are a strong point.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System B.\n\nSystem B provides a much more complete and actionable response to the user's prompt. It delivers a detailed submission checklist, a timeline, identified risks with mitigations, and concrete experiments, all grounded in relevant literature and conference guidelines. While System A's interactive approach is valuable for personalization, it defers the core deliverable (the checklist and timeline) until further input. System B's comprehensive upfront response is more directly useful for a researcher seeking immediate guidance for paper submission.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a complete and actionable submission checklist, timeline, and risk assessment upfront, directly addressing the user's prompt.
