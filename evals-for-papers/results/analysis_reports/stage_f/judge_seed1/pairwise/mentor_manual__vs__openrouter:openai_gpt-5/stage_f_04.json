      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions to understand the user's context before providing advice. This is a good approach for personalized guidance.\n    * System B: Does not ask clarifying questions but instead provides a comprehensive overview of venue expectations and a sample plan. This is less personalized but more immediately informative.\n    * **Tie**: Both approaches have merit depending on the user's preference. System A's approach is more interactive and tailored, while System B's is more direct and informative.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Acknowledges the persona's need for mapping venue-specific formatting and artifact expectations and adapting their plan. It correctly identifies the missing information needed to fulfill this request.\n    * System B: Directly addresses the user's prompt by providing venue-specific information and an adapted plan. It assumes a specific paper title (\"Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?\") which might not be the user's actual paper, but the structure and advice are generally applicable.\n    * **A**: System A is better because it explicitly asks for the necessary context to *truly* adapt the plan, rather than making assumptions or providing a generic template.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Does not offer critique as it is still in the information-gathering phase.\n    * System B: Implicitly critiques by highlighting common pitfalls (e.g., desk rejection for formatting, de-anonymization) and suggesting best practices (e.g., reproducibility section, artifact availability).\n    * **B**: System B provides valuable methodological insights relevant to the user's task.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Outlines a plan for gathering information and then providing tailored advice. It also suggests immediate actionable steps for the user.\n    * System B: Provides a detailed week-by-week plan for submission preparation, covering formatting, artifacts, and risks. It also includes a checklist.\n    * **B**: System B's plan is much more complete and actionable in the context of the user's request to adapt their plan.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Does not provide literature guidance at this stage, as it is focused on gathering user context.\n    * System B: Provides numerous citations to official venue guidelines and related resources, which are highly relevant and useful for the user.\n    * **B**: System B excels in providing direct and relevant literature guidance.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers actionable next steps for the user to gather information and suggests immediate 2-hour actions. It also lists what it *will* provide once it has the context.\n    * System B: Provides a highly actionable week-by-week plan and a detailed risk assessment with mitigations.\n    * **B**: System B is significantly more actionable and provides a concrete plan with explicit risk management.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres to guidelines by not overclaiming and by seeking necessary information before providing advice.\n    * System B: Adheres to guidelines by providing verifiable information (linked sources) and avoiding overclaiming. It does make an assumption about the paper title, which is a minor deviation.\n    * **Tie**: Both systems follow the core guidelines well. System A's approach is more cautious, while System B is more proactive.\n\n### Final Winner: B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a comprehensive and actionable response that directly addresses the user's prompt by mapping venue expectations and offering a detailed submission plan with risk management. While System A's interactive approach is valid, it defers providing substantive help until more information is gathered, whereas System B offers immediate value and concrete steps.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a comprehensive and actionable response that directly addresses the user's prompt by mapping venue expectations and offering a detailed submission plan with risk management.
