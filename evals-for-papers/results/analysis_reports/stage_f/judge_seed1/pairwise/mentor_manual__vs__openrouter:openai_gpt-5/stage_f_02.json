The responses are conversational and do not contain the structured information needed to assess aspects like \"Methodology Critique\" or \"Plan Completeness & Ordering.\"\n\nTo provide a JSON output, I would need the system responses to be more structured, perhaps in a format that outlines their proposed plan, critiques, or guidance in a way that can be systematically evaluated against the given criteria.\n\nIf you can provide the system responses in a more structured format, I would be happy to evaluate them.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"Tie\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"Tie\",\n  \"justification\": \"Both systems correctly identify that the user's paper is missing and ask for it.
