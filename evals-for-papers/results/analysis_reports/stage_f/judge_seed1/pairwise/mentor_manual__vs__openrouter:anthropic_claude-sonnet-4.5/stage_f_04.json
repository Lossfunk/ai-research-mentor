      "raw": "### **Evaluation**\n\n### **System A**\n- **Inquiry Quality**: B - The system does not ask any questions. It assumes the user wants a comparison of top ML venues and provides a detailed comparison.\n- **Persona Adaptation**: B - The system does not ask clarifying questions to adapt to the persona's specific needs or constraints. It provides a generic comparison of major ML venues.\n- **Methodology Critique**: Tie - The system does not critique methodology as the prompt is about venue expectations.\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: B - The system provides a detailed comparison of venues and a sample page allocation for the user's paper for each venue. However, it does not create a concrete, actionable plan or discuss risks beyond general anonymization violations.\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: Tie - The system does not provide literature guidance.\n- **Actionability & Risks**: B - The system provides some actionable advice in the page allocation strategy and lists risks like desk rejection for anonymization violations. However, it doesn't offer a structured plan with milestones or detailed risk mitigation strategies.\n- **Guideline Adherence**: B - The system provides a lot of information but doesn't explicitly ask for user input to tailor the plan, which is a missed opportunity for better guidance. It also doesn't explicitly mention risks beyond anonymization.\n\n### **System B**\n- **Inquiry Quality**: A - The system asks targeted, clarifying questions to understand the user's specific needs, constraints, and preferences (venue shortlist, track, timeline, data/code release, human subjects, proprietary data). This is crucial for tailoring the output.\n- **Persona Adaptation**: A - The system explicitly states its need for user input to tailor the response, demonstrating a strong understanding of persona adaptation. It offers to propose venues if the user is undecided.\n- **Methodology Critique**: Tie - The system does not critique methodology as the prompt is about venue expectations.\n- **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: A - The system outlines a comprehensive plan for what it *will* deliver, including a detailed matrix and an adapted execution plan with specific milestones (anonymization worklist, reproducibility package assembly, data release pathway, compliance checks, calendar of deadlines). This is a much more complete and structured approach than System A.\n- **Literature Guidance Quality**: Tie - The system does not provide literature guidance.\n- **Actionability & Risks**: A - The system clearly defines actionable next steps (user provides input) and promises a detailed, actionable plan with milestones, including risk mitigation (e.g., legal/ethical checks for data release, anonymization audit).\n- **Guideline Adherence**: A - The system adheres to the guidelines by asking clarifying questions and promising a tailored output. It avoids overclaiming by stating what it *will* deliver based on user input.\n\n### **Comparison**\n\nSystem B is superior because it prioritizes understanding the user's specific context before generating a response. It asks relevant clarifying questions about target venues, constraints, and timelines, which are essential for creating a truly personalized and actionable plan. System A jumps directly into providing a generic comparison of major venues without gathering this crucial information, making its output less tailored and potentially less useful. System B's proposed output is also more comprehensive, detailing specific components like an anonymization worklist, reproducibility package assembly, and a calendar of deadlines, which are critical for a successful submission.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B excels by asking crucial clarifying questions to tailor its response, demonstrating superior persona adaptation and inquiry quality.
