The summary is grounded in the context of a federated learning benchmark paper, as requested. It clearly identifies major strengths, concerns, and missing artifacts, and even suggests concrete, falsifiable experiments. The use of citations ([P1], [P5], etc.) and literature anchors demonstrates a deep understanding of the domain and the ability to connect the simulated paper to existing work. The questions embedded within the concerns (e.g., \"Please clarify whether you model label- and feature-skew...\") are highly targeted and directly relevant to improving the quality and rigor of the benchmark. The suggestions for the camera-ready version are actionable and specific. This response fully meets the criteria for a score of 2.0.",
