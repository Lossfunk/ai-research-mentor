For example, while it lists 'ε (epsilon) and δ (delta) values reported for all experiments,' it doesn't tell the user *how* to report them or provide a specific format. Similarly, for 'IRB approval obtained (attach letter),' it doesn't specify the exact format or location for attachment. The code repository structure is a good step, but the actual commands are placeholders (e.g., `[Installation instructions]`).\n\nThe initial request for the user's manuscript is a minor gap, as the prompt asked for a checklist *before* the agent saw the paper, implying a generic but comprehensive one. The agent delivers a comprehensive one, but the initial statement implies a dependency that isn't strictly necessary for the checklist itself.",
