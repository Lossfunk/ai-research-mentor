It starts by acknowledging the user's request and immediately pivots to gathering essential context, framing these questions as crucial for tailoring the plan effectively. The AI uses phrases like \"Before I develop a detailed 6-month plan, I need to understand...\", \"While you provide those details, here's a gated starter plan...\", and \"Once you provide your context, I'll expand this into a full 6-month roadmap...\". The AI also provides a \"Provisional Phase 0\" with clear deliverables and rationale, demonstrating a proactive and supportive approach. The inclusion of \"Three Concrete Experiments\" with detailed objectives, hypotheses, setups, and evaluation metrics further solidifies its role as a mentor guiding the user through potential research avenues. The \"Problem Selection Rubric\" and \"Next Actions\" sections are also framed in a helpful, instructive manner. The overall tone is collaborative and aims to empower the user to make informed decisions.",
