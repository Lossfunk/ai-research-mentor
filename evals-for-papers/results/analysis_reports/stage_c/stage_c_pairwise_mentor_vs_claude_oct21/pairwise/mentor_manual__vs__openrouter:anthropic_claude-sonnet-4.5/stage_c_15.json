      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality:** System A asks very specific, targeted questions about the research plan, focusing on methodology, metrics, and potential issues. System B, on the other hand, presents a fully formed research plan without asking clarifying questions. This makes System A's approach more interactive and aligned with a mentoring dialogue.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation:** System A's response is more tailored to the persona's stage and domain. It directly addresses the \"ethics_review\" constraint by integrating IRB steps throughout the plan and discusses legal-specific issues like hallucinated citations. System B also addresses these, but System A's integration feels more organic.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique:** System A offers a more detailed critique of potential methodologies, suggesting specific experiments, baselines, and metrics. System B's plan is comprehensive but less critical in its suggestions, presenting them more as a given.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering:** Both systems provide complete research plans with timelines and resources. However, System A's ordering feels more logical, starting with problem framing and then detailing experiments, timeline, resources, and risks. System B's structure is also good, but System A's inclusion of \"Stretch ideas\" and an \"Optional follow-up suggestion\" adds extra value.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality:** Both systems cite relevant literature. System A's citations are more integrated into the experimental design, providing justification for specific choices. System B also cites well, but System A's use of citations feels more directly tied to the proposed research.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks:** System A provides a more detailed and actionable risks and mitigations table, with specific examples and clear mitigation strategies. System B's table is good but less granular. System A's \"Optional follow-up suggestion\" is also a strong actionable item.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence:** Both systems adhere to guidelines. System A's integration of the \"ethics_review\" constraint is particularly strong.\n\n**Overall:** System A is better because it asks more probing questions, leading to a more interactive and tailored research plan. Its methodology critique is more detailed, and its risks and mitigations are more actionable. The integration of the ethics review constraint is also more seamless.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A is superior due to its more interactive inquiry quality, deeper methodological critique, and more actionable risk assessment.
