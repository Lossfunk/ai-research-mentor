      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks good, specific questions that probe the core challenges of applying GNNs to sea ice. The questions are well-scoped and aim to uncover novel insights.\n    * System B: Asks good, but slightly more general questions. They are well-scoped and relevant.\n    * **Vote**: A (System A's questions are slightly more nuanced and directly address potential GNN advantages/disadvantages in this domain).\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Adopts a very structured, detailed, and comprehensive research plan format. It feels like a senior researcher's proposal. The persona is \"C\" stage, which implies a more advanced researcher.\n    * System B: Also provides a structured plan, but it's slightly less detailed in its experimental descriptions and overall scope. It feels more like a plan for a PhD student or postdoc.\n    * **Vote**: A (System A's depth and detail better match the \"C\" stage persona).\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques methodology by proposing specific experiments with hypotheses, methods, metrics, and expected outcomes. It explicitly mentions baselines and comparisons.\n    * System B: Also critiques methodology through its experiments, including hypotheses, setups, baselines, and metrics.\n    * **Vote**: Tie (Both systems offer strong methodological critiques through their experimental designs).\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a very comprehensive plan covering problem definition, literature, methodology (broken into phases), data, evaluation, contributions, challenges, timeline, and success criteria. The ordering is logical.\n    * System B: Also provides a comprehensive plan covering framing, goals, experiments, timeline, resources, risks, and stretch ideas. The ordering is logical.\n    * **Vote**: A (System A is more complete, especially in its detailed breakdown of methodology into phases and its explicit \"Success Criteria\" section, which is crucial for a research plan).\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides 4 relevant citations with brief descriptions of their relevance. The citations appear recent and directly related to GNNs and sea ice.\n    * System B: Provides 4 citations, but they are less directly relevant. [P1] is about sea level prediction, [P2] is about quantum physics-informed networks for climate modeling, [P3] is about neural diffusion equations for climate modeling, and [P4] is about GNNs for soil organic carbon. While related to climate/ML, they are not as specific to sea ice GNNs as System A's.\n    * **Vote**: A (System A's literature guidance is significantly more relevant and useful for the specific task).\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Lists potential challenges and provides mitigations. The timeline is detailed.\n    * System B: Provides a dedicated \"Risks and Mitigations\" table, which is very well-structured and actionable. It also includes a \"Resources\" section and \"Stretch Ideas.\"\n    * **Vote**: B (System B's risk assessment is more thorough and presented in a more actionable format. The inclusion of resources and stretch ideas also adds to its actionability).\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Avoids overclaiming. Citations are provided.\n    * System B: Avoids overclaiming. Citations are provided, though less relevant.\n    * **Vote**: Tie (Both systems adhere well to general guidelines).\n\n### Winner: A\n### Justification:\nSystem A provides a more comprehensive and detailed research plan, particularly in its methodology and literature guidance, which are highly relevant to the specific domain. While System B offers a well-structured risk assessment and resource section, System A's depth and directness in addressing the core research questions and relevant prior work make it the superior response for a stage \"C\" researcher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more comprehensive and detailed research plan, particularly in its methodology and literature guidance, which are highly relevant to the specific domain.
