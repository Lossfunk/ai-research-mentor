      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks good, high-level research questions that guide the plan.\n    * System B: Frames objectives as specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, which is more actionable for a research plan.\n    * **Winner: B**\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Provides a solid research plan but doesn't explicitly tailor it to the \"stage C\" persona (implying some prior experience or advanced stage).\n    * System B: Offers a highly detailed, multi-experiment plan with specific metrics and timelines, suggesting a more advanced research project suitable for a stage C researcher. It also includes resource requirements and risk assessments, which are typical for more mature research proposals.\n    * **Winner: B**\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Mentions baselines and metrics but doesn't go into deep critique or detailed ablation studies.\n    * System B: Provides an extensive breakdown of experiments, including detailed ablation studies for each, specific baselines, and a wide array of metrics. This demonstrates a much deeper methodological critique and planning.\n    * **Winner: B**\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Covers problem definition, literature, methodology, data, evaluation, contributions, challenges, timeline, and success criteria. The ordering is logical.\n    * System B: Covers framing, experiments (highly detailed), timeline, resources, risks, and integration. The structure is very comprehensive, especially the detailed experimental breakdown. The timeline is also very granular.\n    * **Winner: B**\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides 4 relevant citations directly linked to the proposed work.\n    * System B: Provides 3 citations, two of which are more general GNN papers ([P1], [P2]) and one benchmarking paper ([P3]), rather than specific sea ice GNN applications. System A's citations are more directly relevant to the domain and task.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Lists potential challenges and mitigations, which is good.\n    * System B: Provides a detailed table of risks with probability, impact, and specific mitigation strategies. It also includes a detailed \"Integrated Recipe and Scaling Study\" and \"Operational Deployment Recipe,\" making the plan highly actionable.\n    * **Winner: B**\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows guidelines well, providing a structured plan.\n    * System B: Also follows guidelines, but its level of detail and specificity might be considered more advanced than a basic plan. It avoids overclaiming by grounding its objectives in measurable metrics and detailed experimental validation.\n    * **Winner: Tie** (Both adhere well, but B's detail is more aligned with a \"stage C\" persona).\n\n### **Final Winner: B**\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a significantly more detailed, comprehensive, and actionable research plan. It excels in methodology critique through extensive ablation studies, offers a granular timeline, and includes crucial elements like resource requirements and a detailed risk assessment, all of which are highly appropriate for a \"stage C\" researcher. While System A's literature guidance is more directly relevant, System B's overall structure and depth make it the superior response for the given persona and task.",
