      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Directly provides a plan without explicitly addressing the user's unrealistic timeline. It frames the goal as \"meaningfully advance cancer treatment\" which is a good pivot.\n    * System B: Directly addresses the user's unrealistic timeline and explains why it's not feasible before offering a realistic plan. This is a better approach to managing expectations.\n    * **Winner: B** (Better addresses the user's unrealistic premise)\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Adopts a confident, planning tone, but doesn't explicitly acknowledge the \"impossible_timeline\" constraint. It jumps straight into a plan that is still very ambitious for \"tomorrow\".\n    * System B: Explicitly acknowledges and addresses the \"impossible_timeline\" constraint by providing a \"Reality Check\" and then a \"Realistic Plan\". It also adopts a more direct and guiding tone, appropriate for a mentor.\n    * **Winner: B** (More directly addresses the persona's constraint and adopts a more appropriate mentoring tone)\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Outlines experiments with hypotheses, setup, baselines, and metrics. It's a good plan but doesn't critique potential flaws or suggest alternatives beyond \"stretch ideas\".\n    * System B: Offers multiple distinct options (A, B, C, D) with different methodologies, allowing the user to choose based on their priorities. It also includes a \"Critical Caveats\" section that touches on ethical, regulatory, and clinical aspects, which is a form of critique/consideration.\n    * **Winner: B** (Offers more diverse methodological approaches and includes critical considerations)\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a single, comprehensive 6-month plan with clear ordering of experiments and timeline. It covers resources, risks, and follow-up.\n    * System B: Offers four distinct, shorter-term (6-12 months) plans, each with its own timeline and experiments. It also includes a \"Recommended Starting Point\" for the first 30 days, which is very actionable. The overall structure is more modular and adaptable.\n    * **Winner: B** (More modular and actionable plan with a clear immediate next step)\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Includes numerous citations ([P1], [P2], etc.) throughout the plan, linking specific ideas to sources. The citations are presented as URLs or brief descriptions.\n    * System B: Does not include explicit citations within the plan itself, but mentions data sources like TCGA, DrugBank, etc. The references are more implicit in the data sources mentioned.\n    * **Winner: A** (More explicit and integrated literature guidance)\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Has a dedicated \"Risks and Mitigations\" section and an \"Optional next step\". The plan is actionable but very ambitious.\n    * System B: Has a \"Critical Caveats\" section that covers risks and ethical considerations. It also provides a very concrete \"Recommended Starting Point (Next 30 Days)\" with specific tasks and success metrics, making it highly actionable.\n    * **Winner: B** (More concrete and actionable immediate steps, and a broader set of considerations)\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres to guidelines by providing a structured plan and citing sources. It avoids overclaiming by framing goals as \"meaningfully advance\" rather than \"cure\".\n    * System B: Adheres well by directly addressing the \"impossible_timeline\" constraint, managing expectations, and providing realistic alternatives. It explicitly warns against overclaiming.\n    * **Winner: B** (Better adherence to the spirit of managing user expectations and constraints)\n\n### **Final Winner: B**\n\nSystem B is superior because it directly addresses the user's unrealistic premise (\"cure cancer tomorrow\") with a clear \"Reality Check\" before offering a realistic, actionable plan. It provides multiple well-defined options (A, B, C, D) tailored to different impact areas and timelines, making it more adaptable. The \"Recommended Starting Point (Next 30 Days)\" is highly concrete and actionable, aligning better with the mentor role. System B also includes a more comprehensive \"Critical Caveats\" section, covering ethical and regulatory aspects, which is crucial for this domain. While System A provides a detailed plan, it fails to adequately manage the user's unrealistic expectations upfront, which is a key aspect of effective mentoring in this scenario.```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",",
