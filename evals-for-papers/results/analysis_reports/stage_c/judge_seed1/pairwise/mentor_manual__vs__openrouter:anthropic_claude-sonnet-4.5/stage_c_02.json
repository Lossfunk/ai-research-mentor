      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks good, high-level research questions that frame the problem well.\n    - System B: Frames the problem with a clear objective and lists specific methods and metrics.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems do a good job of framing the problem and identifying key questions/methods.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Provides a very detailed, structured, and comprehensive plan. It covers all aspects of a research plan, including problem definition, experiments, evaluation, timeline, contributions, resources, risks, and success criteria. The tone is professional and appropriate for a researcher.\n    * System B: Also provides a detailed plan, but it's more focused on the experimental details and literature. It lists specific methods, experiments, and resources. The inclusion of citations and a \"stretch ideas\" section is also good.\n    * **A**. System A is slightly better because it provides a more holistic research plan, covering aspects like \"Expected Contributions\" and \"Success Criteria\" which are crucial for a research proposal. System B is more like a detailed experimental proposal.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques methodology implicitly by proposing experiments and ablations that address potential issues (e.g., comparing different importance metrics, layer-wise compression sensitivity). It also includes a good \"Risk Mitigation\" section.\n    * System B: Critiques methodology more explicitly by stating hypotheses for each experiment and listing potential risks and mitigations. It also includes a section on \"Calibration, robustness, and alignment drift under compression\" which is a good critique of potential failure modes.\n    * **B**. System B is more explicit in its critique by framing experiments as hypotheses and directly addressing potential failure modes and their mitigations.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a very complete plan, with a clear monthly breakdown of experiments, deliverables, and weekly milestones. The ordering of experiments is logical, starting with baselines and progressing to more advanced techniques.\n    * System B: Also provides a good plan with a monthly breakdown and milestones. The ordering of experiments is also logical. It includes more specific details on the methods and literature.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems provide very complete and well-ordered plans. System A is slightly more comprehensive in its overall structure (e.g., including \"Expected Contributions\"), while System B is more detailed in its experimental descriptions and literature grounding.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Lists key recent work as \"Literature Anchors\" but doesn't integrate them deeply into the experimental descriptions.\n    * System B: Integrates literature citations directly into the experiment descriptions and provides a list of \"Literature anchors\" with brief descriptions. This makes the guidance more actionable and contextualized.\n    * **B**. System B's integration of citations is more effective for guiding the research.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Has a dedicated \"Risk Mitigation\" section and a \"Timeline\" with weekly milestones, making it actionable.\n    * System B: Also has a \"Risks and mitigations\" section and a detailed monthly timeline with milestones. The \"Optional next step\" is also highly actionable.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems provide actionable plans with clear risk assessments and mitigations.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows guidelines well, providing a structured plan without overclaiming.\n    * System B: Also follows guidelines well, grounding its plan in literature and providing specific, measurable outcomes. It avoids overclaiming.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems adhere well to the guidelines.\n\n### **Final Winner: B**\n\nSystem B is slightly better because it more effectively integrates literature guidance into the experimental plan, making it more grounded and actionable. Its methodology critique is also more explicit, and the inclusion of specific citations with descriptions enhances its utility. While System A provides a more comprehensive *research plan* structure, System B offers a more detailed and practically oriented *experimental plan* which is more aligned with the task of suggesting experiments.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"Tie\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B is slightly better due to its more effective integration of literature citations into the experimental plan, making it more grounded and actionable.
