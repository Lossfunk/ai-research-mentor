      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks good, open-ended questions that cover the breadth of the problem.\n    * System B: Frames objectives as specific, measurable goals, which is good for a plan, but less about seeking novel inquiry.\n    * **A**\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Adopts a research plan structure, suitable for a Stage C researcher.\n    * System B: Adopts a more publication-focused, execution-plan style, which is also suitable but slightly less exploratory than A.\n    * **A**\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Integrates critiques within the experimental design (e.g., comparing importance metrics, QAT vs PTQ).\n    * System B: Critiques are more implicit in the design of experiments and ablations, but less explicitly stated as critiques.\n    * **A**\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a well-structured, progressive plan with clear monthly goals and deliverables.\n    * System B: Also provides a detailed plan, but the ordering feels slightly less intuitive, jumping between different compression types without a clear progression. The timeline is also more granular (weeks vs months).\n    * **A**\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides a concise list of relevant, recent literature anchors.\n    * System B: Provides a list of citations, but they are less integrated into the plan and some appear to be older or less directly relevant to the core LLM compression task described. The citation format is also less helpful.\n    * **A**\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly outlines risks and mitigations, and provides concrete next steps.\n    * System B: Also outlines risks and mitigations, but the \"Contingency Plans\" section is more detailed and actionable.\n    * **B**\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows guidelines well, avoids overclaiming.\n    * System B: Overclaims significantly in its objectives (e.g., \"≥90% task performance retention\", \"4-8× compression ratio\", \"≥60% inference latency reduction\"). This is a major issue for a research plan.\n    * **A**\n\n### Final Winner: A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more balanced and realistic research plan, focusing on exploration and incremental progress. System B's overly ambitious and specific objectives, coupled with less relevant literature guidance, make it less suitable for a Stage C researcher planning a 6-month project. System A's structure and content are more aligned with the persona and task.",
