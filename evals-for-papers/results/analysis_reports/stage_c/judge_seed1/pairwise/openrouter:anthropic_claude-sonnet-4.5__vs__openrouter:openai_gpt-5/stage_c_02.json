      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks specific, falsifiable hypotheses and clearly defines acceptance criteria for each experiment. This demonstrates a strong understanding of experimental design.\n    * System B: Poses broader research questions and hypotheses that are less specific and harder to falsify directly. For example, \"Can we identify and preserve 'critical' parameters/structures during compression?\" is a good question but not a falsifiable hypothesis for a specific experiment.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the persona's constraints (6 months, compressible LLMs) and provides a detailed, structured plan with specific experiments, timelines, and metrics. It also grounds claims in literature.\n    * System B: Also addresses the persona's constraints and provides a detailed plan. However, it's more general in its experimental descriptions and doesn't integrate literature anchors as effectively within the plan itself.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Critiques methodology by proposing specific ablations for each experiment, directly addressing potential confounds and variations in parameters (e.g., bit-width, group size, calibration set size). It also includes clear hypotheses and acceptance criteria.\n    * System B: Mentions ablations but they are listed separately at the end and not as tightly integrated into the experimental descriptions as in System A. The hypotheses are also less specific.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a comprehensive plan covering experiments, ablations, timeline, models, datasets, metrics, risks, and deliverables. The ordering of experiments is logical, building from simpler to more complex techniques.\n    * System B: Also provides a comprehensive plan with experiments, timeline, evaluation, resources, risks, and success criteria. The ordering is generally logical, but System A's integration of ablations within each experiment makes its plan feel more cohesive.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Integrates literature anchors directly within the descriptions of experiments and goals, providing immediate context and grounding for the proposed methods.\n    * System B: Lists literature anchors at the end, which is less integrated and less immediately useful for understanding the rationale behind specific experiments.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly outlines risks and provides specific mitigations tied to the proposed experiments. The deliverables are also well-defined.\n    * System B: Also outlines risks and mitigations, and defines deliverables and success criteria. System A's risks and mitigations feel slightly more concrete and tied to the specific experimental steps.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to guidelines by providing a structured plan, grounding claims, and avoiding overclaiming. It uses literature anchors effectively.\n    * System B: Also adheres to guidelines, but its integration of literature and specificity in experimental design is weaker compared to System A.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n### Winner: A\n### Justification:\nSystem A provides a more detailed, actionable, and well-grounded research plan. Its strengths lie in its specific, falsifiable hypotheses with clear acceptance criteria, the tight integration of literature anchors within experimental descriptions, and the explicit inclusion of ablations as part of each experiment's design. This makes System A's plan more robust and easier to execute.",
