      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A asks very specific, measurable, and falsifiable questions. System B's questions are more general and less specific.\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: System A is better adapted to the persona's stage (C) and domain (sea ice) by providing a highly detailed and actionable plan. System B is more general.\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A excels here by detailing specific baselines, ablations, metrics, and potential confounds. System B is more high-level.\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a comprehensive, well-ordered 6-month plan with clear milestones and deliverables. System B's plan is less detailed and its milestones are less concrete.\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both systems cite relevant literature. System A's citations are more integrated into the specific experimental design and provide stronger justification for its choices.\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A is far more actionable, providing a detailed timeline, resource estimates, and specific risks with mitigations. System B is less concrete.\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to guidelines. System A's detailed plan and falsifiable objectives demonstrate a strong understanding of research rigor.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a significantly more detailed, actionable, and publication-ready research plan. It clearly defines measurable objectives, specific experiments with baselines and ablations, a realistic timeline, resource estimates, and potential risks, all grounded in relevant literature. System B offers a more general outline, lacking the specificity and depth required for a Stage C researcher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a highly detailed, actionable, and publication-grade research plan with specific objectives, experiments, baselines, ablations, and a timeline.
