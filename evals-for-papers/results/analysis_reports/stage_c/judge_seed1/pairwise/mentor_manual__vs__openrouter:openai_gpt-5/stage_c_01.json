      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks a clear, overarching research question and breaks it down into specific objectives. The questions are well-scoped and aim to explore novel applications of GNNs in sea ice.\n    * System B: Frames the plan around \"core targets\" and \"design principles,\" which are less direct questions but effectively guide the research. The targets are specific and measurable.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems demonstrate strong inquiry quality, with A being more explicit in its question format and B being more implicit through its targets.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Adopts a formal, structured research plan format. It clearly outlines objectives, experiments, timelines, resources, and risks, which aligns with a Stage C researcher. The language is appropriate for the domain.\n    * System B: Also adopts a structured plan but is more concise. It uses more technical jargon and abbreviations (\"SIC,\" \"SAR,\" \"convjecture\") which might be appropriate for a Stage C researcher, but the \"conjecture\" tags feel a bit informal or like placeholders.\n    * **A**. System A feels more like a complete, polished research plan suitable for a Stage C researcher, whereas System B's use of \"conjecture\" and slightly less formal structure makes it feel a bit less polished.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Proposes specific experiments with hypotheses, setups, baselines, and evaluation metrics. It explicitly mentions potential improvements (e.g., \"15-25% improvement\") and discusses physics-informed constraints and multi-scale attention.\n    * System B: Integrates methodology critique more directly into the plan. It discusses specific graph construction methods (geodesic, k-NN, Delaunay), different GNN architectures (ST-GCN/GAT, residual message passing, autoregressive rollout), and evaluation metrics (edge distance error, probabilistic skill, vector RMSE, collision F1). It also mentions specific validation strategies like out-of-time/region tests and stress tests.\n    * **B**. System B provides a more detailed and nuanced critique of potential methodologies, suggesting specific architectures and validation strategies that demonstrate a deeper understanding of potential pitfalls and solutions.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a comprehensive plan covering problem framing, experiments, timeline, resources, risks, and stretch ideas. The ordering is logical, starting with problem definition and moving through execution to future directions.\n    * System B: Covers scope, data/graph construction, models, training/evaluation, and milestones. It's well-organized and logically ordered, focusing on the core research components. The milestones provide a clear, phased approach.\n    * **Tie**. Both plans are complete and well-ordered for their respective approaches. System A is more comprehensive with explicit sections on resources and stretch ideas, while System B's milestones offer a different, equally valid, way to structure the plan.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides specific citations ([P1]-[P7]) linked to different parts of the plan. The citations appear relevant to GNNs, climate modeling, and physics-informed approaches.\n    * System B: Integrates citations ([1]-[9]) directly within the text, linking them to specific techniques or data sources. The citations cover GNNs for sea ice, graph weather modeling, and physics-informed methods.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems provide relevant and well-integrated literature guidance. System A's separate citation list is cleaner, while System B's inline citations are more immediately contextual.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly outlines actionable steps in the timeline and provides a detailed risk assessment table with probabilities, impacts, and mitigations. The \"Optional next step\" is also highly actionable.\n    * System B: The \"Milestones\" section provides clear, actionable steps with timeframes. However, it lacks an explicit risk assessment section, although some risks are implicitly addressed (e.g., by suggesting baselines or validation strategies).\n    * **A**. System A is superior due to its explicit and comprehensive risk assessment section, which is crucial for a Stage C researcher.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows the expected structure of a research plan. It avoids overclaiming by framing expected outcomes as hypotheses and expected outcomes. Citations are provided.\n    * System B: Also adheres to the expected structure and avoids overclaiming by using \"conjecture\" where appropriate. Citations are provided.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems adhere well to general guidelines for research plans and avoid over",
