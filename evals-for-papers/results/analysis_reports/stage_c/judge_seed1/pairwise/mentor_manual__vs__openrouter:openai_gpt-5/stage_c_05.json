      "raw": "* **System A:**\n    * **Strengths:** Directly addresses the user's constraint of not knowing Python by suggesting no-code tools and focusing on data/evaluation. Provides a clear, actionable 8-10 week plan with concrete experiments. The experiments are well-scoped and relevant to the persona's limitations.\n    * **Weaknesses:** The experiments are relatively simple and might not be considered cutting-edge AI research, though they are appropriate for the persona's constraints. The literature guidance is minimal.\n\n* **System B:**\n    * **Strengths:** Proposes a highly ambitious and cutting-edge research plan. It's incredibly detailed, covering multiple experiments, ablations, timelines, resources, and risks. It also explicitly addresses the \"no Python\" constraint by stating all steps are executable via shell scripts and config files.\n    * **Weaknesses:** The proposed research is extremely complex and likely beyond the scope of what a \"Stage C\" researcher with a \"skills_gap\" (especially in Python) could realistically achieve in a short timeframe, even with the provided tooling. The plan feels more like a blueprint for a senior researcher or a small team. The literature citations are more extensive and relevant to the proposed research.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nSystem A is significantly better because it **realistically addresses the user's persona and constraints**. While System B offers a more sophisticated research plan, it fails to adequately consider the user's \"Stage C\" and \"skills_gap\" limitations. The complexity and depth of System B's plan, even with the \"no-code\" promise, would likely be overwhelming and infeasible for the target user. System A provides a practical, achievable path forward, which is the primary goal of the interaction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A is better because it provides a realistic and actionable plan tailored to the user's stated constraints (Stage C, skills gap, no Python).
