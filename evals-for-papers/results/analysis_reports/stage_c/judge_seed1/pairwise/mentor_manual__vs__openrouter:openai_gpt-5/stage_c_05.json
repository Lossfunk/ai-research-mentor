      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions about the user's specific interests and goals within AI research, which is crucial for tailoring the plan. It also probes for the user's comfort level with different types of tools and tasks.\n    * System B: Does not ask any clarifying questions. It jumps directly into proposing a research plan without understanding the user's specific interests or constraints beyond the initial prompt.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the \"no Python\" constraint by suggesting no-code/low-code tools and strategies. It also acknowledges the \"stage C\" by providing a structured, actionable plan with experiments and a timeline.\n    * System B: While it claims to leverage strengths without Python, it doesn't explicitly address the \"skills_gap\" constraint as effectively as System A. It proposes a research plan that seems more suited for someone with a background in qualitative research and AI, rather than someone starting AI research with a skills gap. The proposed research focus (AI-assisted qualitative research) is a very specific niche and might not align with the user's broader interest in \"AI research.\"\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Provides concrete, falsifiable experiments with clear hypotheses, metrics, and ablations. It demonstrates a good understanding of experimental design principles relevant to AI research.\n    * System B: Proposes experiments that are more descriptive and less focused on falsifiable hypotheses. The metrics are also less specific and actionable for an AI research context (e.g., \"analysis depth scores,\" \"methodological alignment\"). The proposed research area itself is very specific and might not be what the user is looking for.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Offers a comprehensive, week-by-week plan that covers setup, experiments, and deliverables. The ordering is logical and practical for a 8-10 week timeframe.\n    * System B: Provides a 6-month timeline, which is much longer than System A's. The plan is less detailed in terms of day-to-day or week-to-week activities and focuses more on broader research goals. It also includes resources and risks, which are good additions, but the core research plan is less concrete.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Cites relevant papers (Northcutt et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022) to support its experimental design choices, demonstrating grounding in existing research.\n    * System B: Provides a list of citations with links, which is helpful. However, the citations seem to be focused on the specific niche of AI in qualitative research, which might not be the user's intended area. The \"P\" notation is also a bit unusual.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Provides highly actionable next steps within the timeline and suggests concrete tools and procedures. The risks are implicitly addressed by the practical, no-code approach.\n    * System B: Lists risks and mitigations in a table, which is a good practice. However, the overall plan is less actionable for someone starting AI research with a skills gap, as the proposed research area is very specialized.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to the persona and task, providing a practical plan that respects the \"skills_gap\" constraint. It avoids overclaiming and focuses on concrete, falsifiable experiments.\n    * System B: While it attempts to address the \"no Python\" constraint, its proposed research area is very specific and might not be what the user intended. It also doesn't ask clarifying questions, which is a missed opportunity for better guideline adherence.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a much more practical, actionable, and tailored plan for someone starting AI research with a Python skills gap. It focuses on concrete, falsifiable experiments using accessible no-code tools, directly addressing the user's constraints. System B proposes a very specific research niche that may not align with the user's interests and offers a less concrete plan for someone new to AI research.```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a highly practical and actionable plan tailored to the user's specific constraints (no Python).
