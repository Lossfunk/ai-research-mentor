      "raw": "* **System A**: This response provides a well-structured and practical plan for federated learning in low-resource countries. It clearly outlines objectives, constraints, a system architecture, a phased rollout plan, core experiments with falsifiable hypotheses, an operational checklist, and risks/mitigations. The plan is grounded in the persona's constraints (low-resource, federated learning) and offers concrete, actionable steps. The literature citations are integrated naturally within the text to support specific points.\n\n* **System B**: This response presents a more ambitious and research-oriented plan, focusing on a \"publication-grade research execution plan.\" It details numerous experiments with extensive ablation studies, a detailed timeline, resource requirements, and a comprehensive risk assessment. However, it feels less like a practical deployment plan for low-resource countries and more like a proposal for a large-scale research project. The objectives are highly quantitative and may be difficult to achieve in a low-resource setting. The citations are listed separately at the end, making them less integrated into the narrative.\n\n**Comparison**:\n\n*   **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems ask good questions implicitly by proposing detailed plans. System A's questions are more geared towards practical implementation, while System B's are more research-focused.\n*   **Persona Adaptation**: System A is superior here. It directly addresses the \"low-resource\" constraint throughout the plan, offering practical solutions like sparse updates, partial participation, and asynchronous rounds. System B mentions low-resource constraints but its plan is very resource-intensive (e.g., multiple V100/A100 GPUs, extensive simulation infrastructure) which contradicts the persona's constraint.\n*   **Methodology Critique**: System B offers a much more detailed critique through its extensive experimental design and ablation studies. System A is more concise but still covers key aspects like communication compression, non-IID data, and privacy.\n*   **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both plans are comprehensive. System A's phased rollout plan is more practical for a deployment scenario. System B's timeline is more geared towards research publication.\n*   **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A integrates citations more effectively to support specific claims within the text. System B lists citations separately, and some of them seem less directly relevant to the core low-resource FL problem (e.g., general FL use cases, wireless FL for resource-constrained IoT).\n*   **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"Operational checklist\" and \"Risks and mitigations\" sections are more directly actionable for someone implementing a plan in a low-resource setting. System B's risks are well-articulated but tied to a larger research project.\n*   **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems attempt to adhere to guidelines. System A's plan feels more aligned with the \"low-resource\" constraint, making it a better fit for the persona. System B's resource requirements and ambitious objectives might be seen as overclaiming feasibility within the given constraints.\n\n**Conclusion**: System A provides a more practical, grounded, and persona-aligned plan for federated learning in low-resource countries. It focuses on achievable steps and directly addresses the constraints. System B offers a more extensive research plan but is less suitable for the specific persona and task due to its high resource demands and research-centric focus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"A\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides a more practical and persona-aligned plan by directly addressing the 'low-resource' constraint with actionable steps and realistic considerations.
