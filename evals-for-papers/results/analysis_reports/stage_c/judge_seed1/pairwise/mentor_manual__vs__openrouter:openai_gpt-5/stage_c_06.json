      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions about the specific domain and metrics, which is good for scoping.\n    * System B: Does not ask clarifying questions, but instead frames the problem and goals based on its understanding of the persona and task.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the \"low-resource\" constraint by suggesting specific techniques like sparse/quantized updates, partial participation, and asynchronous rounds. It also considers privacy and governance relevant to sensitive domains.\n    * System B: Also addresses the \"low-resource\" constraint by focusing on intermittent connectivity, low bandwidth, limited compute, and non-IID data. It proposes experiments tailored to these constraints.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Proposes concrete experiments with falsifiable criteria, including comparisons between different methods and specific measurements.\n    * System B: Outlines experiments with hypotheses, setups, baselines, and evaluation metrics. It also includes a detailed timeline and resource list.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a structured plan with objectives, system architecture, a 6-month rollout, core experiments, an operational checklist, and risks/mitigations. The ordering seems logical.\n    * System B: Offers a comprehensive plan including problem framing, experiments, a timeline, resources, risks/mitigations, and stretch ideas. The ordering is also logical.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Integrates literature references throughout the plan, linking specific techniques to citations.\n    * System B: Provides a dedicated section for literature anchors and also cites papers within the experiment descriptions.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly lists risks and their mitigations, making the plan actionable.\n    * System B: Includes a detailed risks and mitigations table, which is very actionable.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * Both systems seem to adhere to the guidelines, providing evidence-based plans and avoiding overclaiming.\n\n**Comparison**:\n\nBoth systems provide excellent, detailed plans that are highly relevant to the persona and task.\n\n*   **System A** is slightly more concise and directly integrates the technical solutions into the plan structure. Its \"Objectives and constraints\" section is a very strong start, clearly outlining the challenges and proposed solutions. The \"Operational checklist\" is also a nice touch for practical implementation.\n*   **System B** is more exhaustive, particularly in its experimental design. It provides more detail on baselines, evaluation metrics, and statistical rigor (e.g., \"three statistically independent trials per condition, report mean ± 95% CI\"). The \"Stretch ideas\" section is also a valuable addition for future work. The inclusion of a \"Resources\" section is also very practical.\n\n**Winner**: System B is slightly better due to its more comprehensive experimental design, detailed resource planning, and the inclusion of \"stretch ideas\" which demonstrates a deeper understanding of the research process. While System A is very good, System B's structure and depth make it a more complete research plan.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"Tie\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a more comprehensive and detailed research plan, particularly in its experimental design, resource planning, and inclusion of stretch goals.
