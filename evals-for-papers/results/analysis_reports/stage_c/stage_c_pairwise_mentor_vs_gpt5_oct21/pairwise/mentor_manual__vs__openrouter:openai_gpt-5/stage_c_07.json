      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks very specific, quantitative questions about energy-accuracy trade-offs, color correction impact, and human-in-the-loop effectiveness. The questions are well-scoped and directly address the core challenges of the task.\n    * System B: Asks more general questions about the effectiveness of color correction, classification accuracy, and annotation throughput. While relevant, they lack the specificity of System A's inquiries.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the persona's constraints (low-power, edge devices, volunteer divers, specific metrics) and integrates them into the plan. The language is technical and appropriate for a research context.\n    * System B: Also addresses the persona's constraints but is slightly less detailed in its integration. For example, it mentions \"low-power compute\" without specifying the exact hardware as System A does.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Provides a detailed critique of potential methodologies, including specific models (YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n, MobileNetV3/EfficientNet-Lite), quantization (INT8), hardware (Coral TPU), and data sources (SUIM). It also explicitly mentions baselines and metrics for each experiment.\n    * System B: Offers a good critique, mentioning specific models and techniques like DeepSeeColor and CoralNet. However, it's less granular than System A in detailing the experimental setups and baselines for each proposed experiment.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Presents a comprehensive 6-month plan with clear, logical ordering of experiments and milestones. It covers problem framing, experiments, timeline, resources, risks, and stretch goals. The timeline is detailed and realistic.\n    * System B: Also provides a complete plan, but the ordering of experiments feels slightly less cohesive. For instance, Experiment 5 (Field pilot on energy, usability, and reliability) seems like it should be integrated earlier or more closely with other experiments involving hardware and volunteers.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Cites a good mix of relevant papers and practical resources (e.g., CoralNet, Reef Check, GCRMN). The citations are well-integrated into the text and support the proposed experiments and methodologies. It also includes a note on evidence quality, which is a good practice.\n    * System B: Also cites relevant literature, including key papers on Sea-Thru and DeepSeeColor, and platforms like CoralNet and ReefCloud. However, some citations are less specific (e.g., \"Example of MobileNet applied to coral classification\" without a direct link or clear relevance).\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly outlines actionable next steps within the timeline and provides a robust \"Risks and mitigations\" section that is specific and practical. The optional next step is also a good actionable suggestion.\n    * System B: Also provides actionable steps and a risks/mitigations table. However, some mitigations are less concrete (e.g., \"external battery packs\" without specifying capacity or how they address the risk).\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Adheres well to the guidelines. It avoids overclaiming, grounds its proposals in existing literature and tools, and clearly states success criteria. The note on evidence quality is a strong indicator of adherence.\n    * System B: Also adheres to guidelines, but there are a few instances where claims are slightly less grounded or specific, such as the power benchmarks for embedded devices.\n    * **Winner: A**\n\n### Final Winner: A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a more detailed, quantitative, and well-structured plan. Its experimental designs are more specific, its timeline is more logically ordered, and its risk assessment is more thorough. System B is good, but lacks the depth and precision of System A across most aspects.",
