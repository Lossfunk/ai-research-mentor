      "raw": "The user wants a plan for federated learning in low-resource countries. This requires addressing challenges like intermittent connectivity, low bandwidth, heterogeneous devices, and limited energy.\n\n## System A Evaluation\n\n**1. Inquiry Quality:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The system asks clarifying questions about the target application, device profile, and success thresholds. This is crucial for tailoring the plan effectively.\n\n**2. Persona Adaptation:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The plan is highly tailored to the \"low-resource\" constraint, explicitly mentioning challenges like scarce bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, heterogeneous devices, and data sovereignty. It proposes solutions like communication robustness, privacy-by-design, and equitable performance.\n\n**3. Methodology Critique:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The system critiques the canonical FedAvg baseline and proposes specific FL variants (FedProx, asynchronous, personalized) to address the identified challenges. It also outlines clear baselines for each experiment.\n\n**4. Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The plan is comprehensive, covering problem framing, detailed experiments (with hypotheses, setups, baselines, metrics, and expected outcomes), a 6-month timeline with milestones, resource requirements, risks/mitigations, and stretch ideas. The ordering is logical.\n\n**5. Literature Guidance Quality:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The system provides relevant and recent citations that directly support the proposed methods (FedAvg, FedProx, asynchronous FL, privacy in healthcare FL, FL for low-resource edge devices). It also notes limitations in its search and plans to address them.\n\n**6. Actionability & Risks:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The plan is highly actionable, with a detailed timeline and concrete next steps. The risks are well-identified, and practical mitigations are proposed.\n\n**7. Guideline Adherence:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The system adheres to guidelines by providing citations, avoiding overclaiming, and acknowledging limitations in its evidence gathering. It also correctly identifies the need for research guidelines.\n\n## System B Evaluation\n\n**1. Inquiry Quality:**\n- **Score: B**\n- **Justification:** System B does not ask clarifying questions. Instead, it offers a generic plan and then asks for more information in the \"Optional next step\" section. This is less proactive than System A.\n\n**2. Persona Adaptation:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** Similar to System A, System B's plan addresses the low-resource constraints well, focusing on communication efficiency, energy, and device heterogeneity.\n\n**3. Methodology Critique:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** System B also critiques standard FedAvg and proposes relevant FL variants. It outlines experiments with hypotheses, setups, baselines, and metrics.\n\n**4. Plan Completeness & Ordering:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The plan is complete, covering similar sections as System A (goals, experiments, timeline, resources, risks, stretch ideas). The ordering is logical.\n\n**5. Literature Guidance Quality:**\n- **Score: B**\n- **Justification:** While the citations are relevant, they are less specific and actionable than System A's. System B uses generic placeholders like \"[P2]\" and \"[P4]\" which are less informative than direct links and author/year citations. It also explicitly states that its retrieved sources lack detailed guidance on privacy/security, which is a significant gap for FL.\n\n**6. Actionability & Risks:**\n- **Score: A**\n- **Justification:** The plan is actionable with a timeline and identified risks/mitigations.\n\n**7. Guideline Adherence:**\n- **Score: B**\n- **Justification:** System B acknowledges gaps in its literature search regarding privacy/security and states it will address them later. This is less robust than System A, which integrated privacy considerations more thoroughly into its initial plan and cited relevant sources. System B's reliance on generic \"[Px]\" citations also makes it harder to verify claims.\n\n## Comparison and Winner\n\n**System A** is better overall.\n\n**Justification:** System A provides a more concrete and actionable plan. Its literature guidance is superior, with specific citations that directly support its proposed methods. Crucially, System A integrates privacy and security considerations more thoroughly into its initial plan, whereas System B acknowledges this as a gap to be addressed later. System A's proactive inquiry also makes it more tailored to the user's needs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan",
