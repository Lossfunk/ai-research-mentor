      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clear, relevant questions that cover the essential aspects needed to provide tailored advice. The questions are well-scoped and directly address the persona's need for orientation.\n    * System B: Also asks relevant and comprehensive questions, similar to System A. The questions are well-organized under \"Context Questions.\"\n    * **Tie**. Both systems ask excellent, relevant questions.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Acknowledges the \"beginner\" persona and \"orientation\" focus by offering a general roadmap while waiting for answers. The roadmap is practical and covers foundational knowledge and initial steps.\n    * System B: Also acknowledges the persona and focus by providing \"Immediate Guidance\" and framing it as a principled approach to research. It offers three distinct paths, which is a nice touch for a beginner.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems adapt well to the persona and task.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Does not offer critique as it's in the orientation phase and hasn't received any research plan from the user yet.\n    * System B: Offers a critique of common pitfalls (e.g., \"seductive but low-impact\" projects) and explains *why* its suggested paths are principled. This is a good proactive critique for a beginner.\n    * **B**. System B provides a more proactive and insightful critique relevant to the user's stage.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a general roadmap that is logically ordered (Foundations -> Hands-on -> Finding directions). It's a good starting point.\n    * System B: Offers three distinct \"Paths\" which are more concrete than System A's roadmap. The ordering within each path is logical, and the \"Why\" explanations are helpful.\n    * **B**. System B's suggested paths are more actionable and structured for a beginner.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Mentions general resources like courses (CS229, fast.ai) and conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, etc.). This is good general guidance.\n    * System B: Provides specific citations to blog posts and articles (e.g., LessWrong, Alignment Forum, Colah's blog). While these are valuable resources, they might be slightly more advanced or niche for an absolute beginner compared to System A's mention of academic courses and major conferences. However, the *quality* of the linked resources is high.\n    * **Tie**. System A offers more standard, beginner-friendly literature pointers, while System B offers more curated, potentially deeper, but slightly less conventional pointers. Both are useful.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: The \"Getting hands-on\" and \"Finding research directions\" sections are actionable. Risks are not explicitly mentioned.\n    * System B: The three paths are highly actionable. It implicitly addresses risks by warning against \"seductive but low-impact\" projects and emphasizing tractable problems. It also promises a \"2-week starter plan\" upon receiving answers.\n    * **B**. System B is more actionable with its distinct paths and implicitly addresses risks more effectively.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows guidelines well. No overclaiming.\n    * System B: Follows guidelines well. The citations are provided and linked, which is good practice. It avoids overclaiming.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems adhere to the guidelines.\n\n### Winner: B\n\n### Justification:\nSystem B is slightly better because it provides more concrete and actionable starting paths for a beginner researcher. Its \"Immediate Guidance\" section also offers a more principled critique of common research pitfalls, which is valuable for someone new to the field. While both systems ask excellent clarifying questions, System B's structure and the nature of its immediate advice are more tailored to the \"orientation\" focus of the task.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B is slightly better because it provides more concrete and actionable starting paths for a beginner researcher.
