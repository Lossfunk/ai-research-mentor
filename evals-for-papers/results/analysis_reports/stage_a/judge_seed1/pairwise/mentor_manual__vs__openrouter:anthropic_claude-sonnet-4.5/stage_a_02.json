      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions at the end, but the initial response is a comprehensive plan without understanding the user's constraints.\n    * System B: Starts by asking crucial clarifying questions about resources, background, and goals, which is essential for tailoring advice to a beginner. It then provides initial guidance and concrete paths, acknowledging that these might be refined.\n    * **Winner: B** (B's approach is more aligned with understanding the user's needs before providing solutions, which is critical for a beginner.)\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Provides a general roadmap suitable for a beginner but doesn't tailor it to specific constraints. It assumes a certain level of self-direction.\n    * System B: Explicitly asks about the user's background, resources, and goals, demonstrating a strong intent to adapt the advice. The suggested paths are also framed with beginner-friendliness in mind (e.g., \"lightweight emulation,\" \"tabular ML\").\n    * **Winner: B** (B's initial questions are key to adapting to a beginner's specific situation.)\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Does not critique methodology as the user is a beginner and hasn't proposed a methodology. It focuses on foundational steps and project ideas.\n    * System B: While not critiquing a user-proposed methodology, it frames the suggested paths with methodological considerations (e.g., model choices like random forest/gradient boosting vs. CNN, validation strategies, explainability techniques like SHAP, evaluation metrics like AUC/RMSE). It also touches upon potential issues like nonstationarity and transferability.\n    * **Winner: B** (B implicitly guides the user towards sound methodological practices within the suggested projects.)\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a complete roadmap with logical ordering: foundational skills -> explore landscape -> concrete project -> community -> next steps.\n    * System B: Asks for information first, then provides initial guidance and three concrete paths with immediate next actions. The ordering is logical: understand constraints -> provide general advice -> offer specific paths -> immediate actions.\n    * **Winner: Tie** (Both provide a structured approach. A's is a broader roadmap, while B's is more interactive and project-focused after initial information gathering.)\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Recommends key organizations (Climate Change AI) and a seminal survey paper (Rolnick et al., 2019). The references are relevant and foundational.\n    * System B: Provides specific, recent (2023-2024) citations linked to each suggested path. These are more granular and directly tied to the proposed projects, offering concrete examples of how ML is applied in those areas.\n    * **Winner: B** (B's citations are more specific, recent, and directly support the proposed project ideas, making them more actionable for a beginner looking for examples.)\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Offers concrete next steps for the current week and lists important mindset tips. It implicitly addresses risks by suggesting starting small.\n    * System B: Provides immediate next actions (answer questions, pick a path, set up a log) and frames the suggested paths with expected outcomes and potential follow-ups, which implicitly highlights challenges and learning opportunities. It also mentions potential bottlenecks in its initial questions.\n    * **Winner: B** (B's \"Immediate Next Actions\" are very concrete, and the framing of the paths with expected outcomes and follow-ups is more proactive in guiding the user through potential challenges.)\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Follows guidelines by providing helpful advice and avoiding overclaiming. It uses links appropriately.\n    * System B: Follows guidelines well. It uses citations effectively and grounds its suggestions in literature. It avoids overclaiming by framing the suggestions as starting points and acknowledging the need for more user information. The citations are presented clearly.\n    * **Winner: Tie** (Both systems adhere well to the guidelines.)\n\n### Final Winner: B\nSystem B is better because it prioritizes understanding the user's specific constraints and background before offering solutions, which is crucial for a beginner. Its suggested project paths are more concrete, directly linked to recent literature, and framed with methodological considerations and potential next steps, making it more actionable and informative for someone new to the field.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n",
