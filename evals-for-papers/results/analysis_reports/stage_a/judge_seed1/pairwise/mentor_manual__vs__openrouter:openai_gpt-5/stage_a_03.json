      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A asks clarifying questions to tailor its advice. System B jumps straight into advice, offering options but not asking for user input. System A's approach is more interactive and personalized.\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems acknowledge the physics background and its relevance. System A's \"Intuition\" section directly addresses the physics mindset. System B offers specific physics-related subfields. Both are good, but System A's framing feels slightly more tailored to the \"domain switcher\" aspect.\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System B excels here by providing concrete, falsifiable experimental designs with clear hypotheses, models, protocols, metrics, and falsification criteria. System A mentions ablations but doesn't detail them.\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a short-term \"Phase 0\" plan and then asks questions to inform a longer-term plan. System B offers a more detailed 6-8 week plan upfront, including specific experiments. System B's plan is more complete as a standalone piece of advice.\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System B provides specific, relevant papers directly tied to its proposed experiments. System A cites general research process guidelines. System B's literature guidance is more directly useful for the proposed tasks.\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"Immediate Next Steps\" are actionable and time-bound. System B's proposed experiments are also actionable, but the 6-8 week plan is more ambitious. System B implicitly addresses risks by suggesting rigorous evaluation and baselines.\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems seem to adhere to guidelines. System A uses citations for its general advice, while System B uses citations for specific research papers.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a much more concrete and actionable plan with detailed experimental proposals, including specific hypotheses, methods, and falsification criteria. While System A's inquiry is good for personalization, System B's detailed roadmap and literature guidance are more immediately useful for someone looking to start in AI research from a physics background.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown**:\n\n*   **Inquiry Quality**: System A asks good clarifying questions (resources, context, target, bottleneck) which is crucial for tailoring advice. System B jumps into advice without asking, offering options instead. **A wins.**\n*   **Persona Adaptation**: Both acknowledge the physics background. System A's \"Intuition\" section is a nice touch, framing the transition. System B offers specific physics-adjacent AI subfields. Both are good, but System A's framing feels slightly more aligned with the \"domain switcher\" persona. **Tie/Slight A.**\n*   **Methodology Critique**: System B is vastly superior here. It provides detailed, well-structured experimental designs (hypotheses, models, protocols, metrics, falsification) for three concrete experiments. This is exactly the kind of methodological rigor needed. System A mentions ablations but doesn't detail them. **B wins decisively.**\n*   **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A offers a short-term \"Phase 0\" and then defers a longer plan. System B provides a more comprehensive 6-8 week plan with specific experiments. System B's plan is more complete as a standalone piece of advice. **B wins.**\n*   **Literature Guidance Quality**: System B provides specific, relevant research papers directly linked to its proposed experiments (PINNs, HNNs, SBI). System A cites general articles about research processes. System B's guidance is much more directly applicable to starting research. **B wins decisively.**\n*   **Actionability & Risks**: System A's \"Phase 0\" is actionable. System B's proposed experiments are also actionable, and the detailed structure makes them very concrete. System B implicitly addresses risks by emphasizing baselines, multiple seeds, OOD testing, and uncertainty quantification. **B wins.**\n*   **Guideline Adherence**: Both seem to follow guidelines. System A cites general advice sources. System B cites specific research papers and practical ML resources. Both are appropriate. **Tie.**\n\n**Final Decision**: System B is significantly better because it provides a concrete, detailed, and actionable roadmap with specific research experiments grounded in relevant literature. This is more valuable for a user asking \"where do I begin?\" than System A's approach of asking many questions before providing a less detailed initial plan.```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B",
