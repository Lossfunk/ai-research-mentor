      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A provides a fully fleshed-out plan and topic, which is proactive but doesn't ask clarifying questions. System B asks targeted questions to tailor its advice, which is a better inquiry strategy for a mentor.\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: System A assumes the persona can immediately jump into a complex project and provides a detailed plan. System B recognizes the persona's constraints (deadline, stage A) and asks questions to tailor its advice, which is more appropriate for a mentor.\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A critiques its own proposed methodology by including falsification criteria and discussing potential issues. System B doesn't offer critique as it hasn't proposed a methodology yet.\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides a complete plan for a specific topic. System B provides a plan for *how* to arrive at a plan, which is appropriate given the lack of information.\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A provides relevant citations for its proposed topic. System B mentions the need to find recent papers but doesn't provide any specific guidance yet.\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A provides concrete next steps and a timeline, along with practical tips and implicit risks (e.g., needing a GPU). System B provides actionable next steps for gathering information and explicitly states the risk of a tight deadline.\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: System A adheres to guidelines by providing a scoped topic and citing sources. System B adheres by asking clarifying questions and avoiding overclaiming, focusing on a structured approach to problem-solving.\n\n**Winner**: B\n\n**Justification**: System B is better because it acts more like a mentor by asking clarifying questions to tailor its advice to the student's specific situation and constraints. System A jumps to a solution without gathering enough information, which might not be the best fit for the student. System B's approach of gathering information first and then providing tailored recommendations is more effective for mentorship.\n\n**Overall**:\n\n*   **Inquiry Quality**: B is better because it asks clarifying questions to understand the user's needs before offering solutions. A provides a solution directly without asking questions.\n*   **Persona Adaptation**: B is better because it acknowledges the persona's constraints (deadline, stage) and asks questions to tailor its advice. A makes assumptions about the persona's capabilities and provides a detailed plan without much personalization.\n*   **Methodology Critique**: A is better because it includes falsification criteria and discusses potential issues within its proposed methodology. B has not yet proposed a methodology to critique.\n*   **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: A is better because it provides a complete, ordered plan for a specific topic. B provides a plan for *how* to create a plan, which is appropriate given the lack of information, but less complete as a final output.\n*   **Literature Guidance Quality**: A is better because it provides relevant citations for its proposed topic. B mentions the need to find papers but doesn't offer specific guidance yet.\n*   **Actionability & Risks**: A is better because it provides concrete next steps, a timeline, and practical tips. B provides actionable steps for information gathering and mentions risks, but A's are more detailed for a research project.\n*   **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to guidelines. A provides a scoped topic and cites sources. B asks clarifying questions and avoids overclaiming.\n\n**Winner**: A\n\n**Justification**: System A provides a concrete, actionable plan with a well-defined research topic, methodology, and timeline, directly addressing the user's prompt. System B focuses on asking questions, which is a valid mentoring approach, but it defers providing a substantive solution, leaving the user with more work to do before receiving concrete advice. System A's proactive and detailed response is more immediately helpful given the user's tight deadline.",
