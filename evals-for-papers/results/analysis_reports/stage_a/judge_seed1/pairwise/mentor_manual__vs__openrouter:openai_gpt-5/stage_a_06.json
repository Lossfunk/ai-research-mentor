      "raw": "The user wants to do AI research but hates math. The persona is \"math_averse\".\n\n## System A Evaluation\n\n**1. Inquiry Quality:** The system immediately jumps into providing a plan and concrete experiments, rather than asking clarifying questions. This is not ideal for a mentoring dialogue. It assumes what \"math-averse\" means and what the user's goals are.\n\n**2. Persona Adaptation:** The system attempts to adapt by suggesting \"math-light\" lanes and a minimal plan. It acknowledges the persona's constraint. However, it doesn't probe *why* the user hates math, which could lead to better tailoring.\n\n**3. Methodology Critique:** The system provides good critiques within the context of the proposed experiments, discussing metrics, falsification, and ablations.\n\n**4. Plan Completeness & Ordering:** The system provides a detailed, albeit short-term, plan with concrete steps and a reasonable order. It covers setup, baseline reproduction, experimentation, and reporting.\n\n**5. Literature Guidance Quality:** The system provides relevant and recent citations that support its suggested \"math-light\" lanes. The citations are well-integrated into the text.\n\n**6. Actionability & Risks:** The plan is highly actionable, with specific tasks and timelines. It also implicitly addresses risks by focusing on reproducibility and clear reporting. It ends with a tailoring question.\n\n**7. Guideline Adherence:** The system provides concrete suggestions and avoids overclaiming. It grounds its advice in cited literature.\n\n## System B Evaluation\n\n**1. Inquiry Quality:** The system excels here. It asks targeted, insightful questions to understand the user's specific aversion to math, their motivations for AI research, and their resources. This is crucial for providing personalized advice.\n\n**2. Persona Adaptation:** The system directly addresses the \"math_averse\" persona by acknowledging the tension and seeking to understand it. It frames AI research on a spectrum, validating the user's potential path.\n\n**3. Methodology Critique:** This aspect is not directly addressed as the system is focused on information gathering before proposing a methodology.\n\n**4. Plan Completeness & Ordering:** The system does not provide a plan yet, as it's in the information-gathering phase. It proposes an \"Immediate next step\" which is to answer its questions.\n\n**5. Literature Guidance Quality:** The system references Hamming's \"You and Your Research,\" which is a classic but not directly about AI research methodologies. It mentions general areas where math isn't the primary bottleneck but doesn't provide specific paper recommendations yet.\n\n**6. Actionability & Risks:** The immediate next step is actionable (answering questions). It implicitly addresses the risk of giving bad advice by gathering more information first.\n\n**7. Guideline Adherence:** The system avoids overclaiming and focuses on understanding the user before offering solutions.\n\n## Comparison\n\nSystem A provides a direct, actionable plan with concrete experiments, which is impressive. However, it makes assumptions about the user's specific math aversion and goals. System B takes a more mentoring approach by first seeking to understand the user's specific situation and motivations before offering advice. This is more aligned with a mentoring dialogue, especially for a persona like \"math_averse\" where the *reason* for the aversion is key. System B's questions are well-crafted to elicit the necessary information for truly tailored guidance. While System A is more immediately \"useful\" in terms of providing a plan, System B is better at establishing a foundation for effective mentorship.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSystem B is better because it prioritizes understanding the user's specific needs and constraints before offering a plan. This is a more effective mentoring approach, especially for a persona defined by a specific aversion. System A jumps to solutions without sufficient diagnosis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"B\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B excels by prioritizing inquiry quality and persona adaptation, asking crucial questions to tailor advice rather than making assumptions.
