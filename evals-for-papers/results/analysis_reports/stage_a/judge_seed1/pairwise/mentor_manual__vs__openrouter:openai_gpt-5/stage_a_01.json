      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: System A asks broad, open-ended questions to understand the user's background and goals. System B jumps straight into providing a plan and asks a very specific follow-up question. For a \"beginner\" persona focused on \"orientation,\" System A's approach is more appropriate for initial guidance. System B's questions are more about tailoring an already-formed plan.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: System A's questions are well-suited for a beginner who has \"no idea where to start.\" It acknowledges the need for understanding the user's context before offering advice. System B, while providing a comprehensive plan, might be overwhelming for a true beginner and doesn't sufficiently probe their background first.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A doesn't offer a methodology critique as it's still in the information-gathering phase. System B provides a detailed workflow (C) and specific experiments (D) that include elements of methodology like baselines, controlled factors, ablations, and falsification.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: System A provides immediate guidance and three potential paths, but the full plan is contingent on the user's answers. System B provides a complete, albeit potentially overwhelming, plan from the outset, including setup, workflow, experiments, reading, and next steps. The ordering in System B is logical.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: System A cites several articles related to research methodology and taste, which are relevant for a beginner's orientation. System B cites foundational papers and textbooks directly related to the proposed experiments and technical areas, which is highly practical.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A offers actionable \"Starting Paths\" and promises a tailored plan. System B provides very concrete \"starter experiments\" and a detailed 2-3 week plan, making it highly actionable. System B also implicitly highlights risks by emphasizing reproducibility and reporting limitations.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems seem to adhere to guidelines. System A uses citations for its immediate guidance. System B uses citations for its technical recommendations and includes a note about not accessing a formal mentorship tool.\n\n**Winner**: System B\n\n**Justification**: System B provides a much more concrete and actionable plan for a beginner, including specific experiments, a detailed workflow, and a timeline. While System A's questions are good for understanding the user, System B's direct approach offers immediate value and a clear path forward, which is crucial for someone who \"has no idea where to start.\" System B's integration of foundational papers and practical steps makes it more useful for initiating research.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"B\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"B\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"B\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"B\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"B\",\n  \"justification\": \"System B provides a more concrete and actionable plan with specific experiments and a timeline, which is highly beneficial for a beginner.
