      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**: Both systems propose concrete, falsifiable experiments. System A's experiments are slightly more specific in terms of metrics and expected outcomes (e.g., \"≥5 percentage points\"). System B's experiments are also good, but perhaps a bit broader in scope initially. System A's framing of \"Reject if...\" is a strong indicator of falsifiability.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**: Both systems successfully address the \"math averse\" persona by focusing on empirical, data-centric, and evaluation-heavy research. System A's emphasis on \"low-math path\" and \"minimal weekly cadence\" is very direct. System B also acknowledges the minimal math needed.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**: System A is stronger here. It explicitly mentions controlling for seeds, using simple stats (mean ± std), and suggests paired t-tests. It also includes a specific ablation in experiment 3. System B mentions descriptive stats, uncertainty estimates, and multiple seeds, but System A's details are more concrete for a beginner.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**: Both provide a phased plan. System A's weekly cadence is very actionable for someone starting out. System B's 4-6 week plan is also good, but System A's breakdown feels more granular and tailored to the \"math averse\" persona who might need more guidance on pacing.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**: Both provide relevant literature. System A's citations are directly linked to the experiments it proposes, making them more immediately useful. System B provides a broader list of general guidelines and papers. System A's inclusion of \"Model Cards\" and \"TruthfulQA\" as anchors is excellent.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**: System A is more actionable. It provides specific hypotheses, setups, and \"why it's valid\" sections for each experiment. The \"Minimal weekly cadence\" is highly actionable. System B's experiments are also actionable, but System A's detailed breakdown of *how* to run them is superior. Neither explicitly calls out risks beyond the implicit risk of not meeting the hypothesis.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**: Both systems adhere to guidelines. They avoid overclaiming and focus on empirical research. System A's citations are well-integrated and directly support its claims. System B's use of bracketed citations like [G5] is less immediately useful without a clear key, although it does provide a key at the end.\n\n**Overall Winner**: System A.\n\n**Justification**: System A provides more concrete, actionable steps and experimental designs tailored to the \"math averse\" persona. Its detailed breakdown of hypotheses, setups, and a weekly cadence makes it easier for a beginner to get started. While both systems offer good advice, System A's specificity and directness give it an edge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"A\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"A\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"A\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"A\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"B\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A provides more concrete, actionable steps and experimental designs tailored to the 'math averse' persona, including a detailed weekly cadence.
