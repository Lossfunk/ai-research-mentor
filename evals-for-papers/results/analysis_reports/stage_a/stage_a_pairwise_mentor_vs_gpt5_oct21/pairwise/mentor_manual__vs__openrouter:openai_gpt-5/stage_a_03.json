      "judge": "openrouter:google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
      "raw": "1. **Inquiry Quality**:\n    * System A: Asks clarifying questions at the end to tailor the plan further.\n    * System B: Does not ask clarifying questions but offers to tailor the plan if the user provides more information.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems offer to tailor the plan, but neither asks clarifying questions upfront.\n\n2. **Persona Adaptation**:\n    * System A: Directly addresses the physics background and highlights transferable skills. It proposes physics-flavored problems.\n    * System B: Also acknowledges the physics background and transferable skills. It suggests starting with general ML tasks before diving into scientific ML.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems effectively adapt to the persona. System A's focus on physics-flavored problems might be slightly more aligned with a \"domain switcher\" who wants to leverage their existing expertise.\n\n3. **Methodology Critique**:\n    * System A: Integrates critique into the experimental design (e.g., \"Reject if improvement <20% or not significant\").\n    * System B: Explicitly mentions baselines, ablations, and confidence intervals as crucial for critique.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems emphasize critical evaluation within their proposed experiments.\n\n4. **Plan Completeness & Ordering**:\n    * System A: Provides a 6-week ramp-up with specific weekly goals and then details three experiments. It also offers optional next steps.\n    * System B: Offers a 4-8 week core skills section, a practical learning loop, a suggested sequence for 6-10 weeks, and then three experiments. It also includes immediate next steps.\n    * **Tie**. Both provide comprehensive, well-ordered plans with clear timelines and actionable steps. System B's structure feels slightly more granular and detailed.\n\n5. **Literature Guidance Quality**:\n    * System A: Provides specific links to tutorials, courses, and papers relevant to the proposed physics-flavored experiments.\n    * System B: Provides a list of \"anchors\" with citations, some of which are general ML research guides and one book.\n    * **A**. System A's literature guidance is more directly tied to the concrete experiments it proposes, making it more immediately useful. System B's references are more general.\n\n6. **Actionability & Risks**:\n    * System A: Clearly defines hypotheses, data/setup, metrics, and rejection criteria for each experiment, making them highly actionable. It implicitly addresses risks by defining clear stop/reject conditions.\n    * System B: Also defines hypotheses, variables, metrics, and expected outcomes. It explicitly mentions the need for ablations and confidence intervals.\n    * **Tie**. Both systems provide very actionable experiments with clear success/failure criteria.\n\n7. **Guideline Adherence**:\n    * System A: Avoids overclaiming and grounds its advice in practical steps. It correctly notes the absence of an internal tool.\n    * System B: Uses bracketed citations extensively, which is good, but some citations ([G1], [G2], [G18]) appear repeatedly and might be overly reliant on a few sources. It also avoids overclaiming.\n    * **Tie**. Both adhere well to guidelines. System A's citation style is less intrusive.\n\n### Winner: A\n* **Justification**: System A is slightly better because its literature guidance is more directly relevant to the concrete, physics-flavored experiments it proposes, making it more immediately actionable for a domain switcher. Both systems provide excellent, actionable plans and adapt well to the persona.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aspect_votes\": {\n    \"inquiry_quality\": \"Tie\",\n    \"persona_adaptation\": \"Tie\",\n    \"methodology_critique\": \"Tie\",\n    \"plan_completeness\": \"Tie\",\n    \"literature_quality\": \"A\",\n    \"actionability_risks\": \"Tie\",\n    \"guideline_adherence\": \"Tie\"\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"A\",\n  \"justification\": \"System A is slightly better because its literature guidance is more directly relevant to the concrete, physics-flavored experiments it proposes, making it more immediately actionable for a domain switcher.
